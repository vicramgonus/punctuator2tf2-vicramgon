It can be a very complicated thing ,COMMA the ocean .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we're making the ocean pretty unhappy in a lot of different ways .PERIOD <BREAK>
People working in these canneries could barely stay there all day because of the smell ,COMMA but you know what they came out saying ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
We made the ocean unhappy ;SEMICOLON we made people very unhappy ,COMMA and we made them unhealthy .PERIOD <BREAK>
We see the base of the food chain ,COMMA the plankton ,COMMA the small things ,COMMA and we see how those animals are food to animals in the middle of the pyramid ,COMMA and on so up this diagram .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA a dolphin ,COMMA mother dolphin ,COMMA any dolphin -- there's only one way that a PCB can get out of a dolphin .PERIOD <BREAK>
And what's that ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Here's a diagram of the PCB load of dolphins in Sarasota Bay .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we also are eating meat that comes from some of these same places .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's a tragedy for those populations ,COMMA but it's also a tragedy for the people eating them because they don't know that that's toxic meat .PERIOD <BREAK>
These same infections create harmful algal blooms .PERIOD <BREAK>
I started out showing how much we had distressed the Monterey Bay ecosystem with pollution and the canning industry and all of the attendant problems .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's an ocean planet ,COMMA and we think of ourselves as a terrestrial species ,COMMA but the pyramid of life in the ocean and our own lives on land are intricately connected .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's a huge driver for culture and I think that it's the most underrated force on our behavior .PERIOD <BREAK>
The people in these studies report feeling so awake during the daytime ,COMMA that they realize they're experiencing true wakefulness for the first time in their lives .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA cut to the modern day .PERIOD <BREAK>
Okay ,COMMA we'll do something with it .PERIOD <BREAK>
Puppets always have to try to be alive .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's their kind of ur-story onstage ,COMMA that desperation to live .PERIOD <BREAK>
His mother was a puppeteer .PERIOD <BREAK>
And ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA it took about 10 years to discover the Bambara Bamana puppets of Mali in West Africa ,COMMA where there's a fabulous tradition of puppetry ,COMMA to learn a renewed ,COMMA or a new ,COMMA respect for this art form .PERIOD <BREAK>
So we made a model .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we had a crate built for it .PERIOD <BREAK>
We were going to test-drive it on the street outside of our house in Cape Town ,COMMA and it got to midnight and we hadn't done that yet .PERIOD <BREAK>
A month later ,COMMA we were there in London with this big box and a studio full of people about to work with us .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we went back to Cape Town and redesigned the horse completely .PERIOD <BREAK>
And here is our factory in Cape Town where we make horses .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'd just like to describe -- I won't talk too loud .PERIOD He might get irritated .PERIOD <BREAK>
The ears are obviously a very important emotional indicator of the horse .PERIOD <BREAK>
When they point right back ,COMMA the horse is fearful or angry ,COMMA depending upon what's going on in front of him ,COMMA around him .PERIOD <BREAK>
The hind legs have got the same action .PERIOD <BREAK>
And Mikey also has ,COMMA in his fingers ,COMMA the ability to move the tail from left to right ,COMMA and up and down with the other hand .PERIOD <BREAK>
And together ,COMMA there's quite a complex possibility of tail expression .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it's very ,COMMA very simple because all that happens is that the puppeteer breathes with his knees .PERIOD <BREAK>
But of course ,COMMA it was the cane is light ,COMMA the cane is flexible ,COMMA the cane is durable and the cane is moldable .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it's driven and propelled forward by new leaders ,COMMA like many of the people here ,COMMA by new tools ,COMMA like the ones we've seen here ,COMMA and by new pressures .PERIOD <BREAK>
What it tells is the story of how today actually could be as historic as 100 years ago .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA this may surprise you .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now we have Wikipedia .PERIOD <BREAK>
Suddenly big things can be done for love .PERIOD <BREAK>
Take a look ,COMMA if you haven't ,COMMA at DonorsChoose .PERIOD <BREAK>
The third category is represented by Warren Buffet ,COMMA which I call aggregated giving .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's that he challenged another assumption ,COMMA that every giver should have his or her own fund or foundation .PERIOD <BREAK>
We have got to realize that it is going to take a long time to do these things .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that's where my imagined future comes in ,COMMA which I am going to call the social singularity .PERIOD <BREAK>
We can create a future where hope and history rhyme .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's why I have one last thing I want to show you .PERIOD <BREAK>
And they were great community leaders .PERIOD <BREAK>
I keep this photograph close by to me -- it's in my office -- because I've always felt a mystical connection to these two men ,COMMA both of whom I never knew .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I want you to imagine that it's 100 years from now ,COMMA and your grandchild ,COMMA or great-grandchild ,COMMA or niece or nephew or god-child ,COMMA is looking at this photograph of you .PERIOD <BREAK>
And what do I mean by that ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And I asked them to come along with the person they communicate with most .PERIOD <BREAK>
What we're actually going to see is that ,COMMA fundamentally ,COMMA people are communicating on a regular basis with five ,COMMA six ,COMMA seven of their most intimate sphere .PERIOD <BREAK>
He just wants to wish her a good day ,COMMA because that's the start of her day .PERIOD <BREAK>
They chat to each other every day ,COMMA a few times a day actually .PERIOD <BREAK>
But it could be in a school ,COMMA it could be an administration ,COMMA it could be a hospital .PERIOD <BREAK>
If you were not ,COMMA you maybe had to go through an operator .PERIOD <BREAK>
The phones were there .PERIOD But the expectation was once you moved in there your commitment was fully to the task at hand ,COMMA fully to the people around you .PERIOD <BREAK>
This only started about 150 years ago .PERIOD <BREAK>
They were living on top of the workshops where they were working .PERIOD <BREAK>
Companies blocking access to IM or to Facebook .PERIOD <BREAK>
How you get it shouldn't make that much of a difference .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA two dozen men can tear down a mountain in several months ,COMMA and only for about a few years' worth of coal .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now Judy and I -- I have to say -- totally related to each other .PERIOD <BREAK>
So homegirls and hillbillies we got it together and totally understand that this is what it's all about .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we know that eco-industrial business ,COMMA these kinds of business models -- there's a model in Europe called the eco-industrial park ,COMMA where either the waste of one company is the raw material for another ,COMMA or you use recycled materials to make goods that you can actually use and sell .PERIOD <BREAK>
And in my hometown ,COMMA we actually tried to do one of these in the Bronx ,COMMA but our mayor decided what he wanted to see was a jail on that same spot .PERIOD <BREAK>
This can support seasonal farmers around metro areas who are losing out because they really can't meet the year-round demand for produce .PERIOD <BREAK>
And imagine a national business model that creates local jobs and smart infrastructure to improve local economic stability .PERIOD <BREAK>
The recession has us reeling and fearful ,COMMA and there's something in the air these days that is also very empowering .PERIOD <BREAK>
There goes my dog who led me to the park in my wedding .PERIOD <BREAK>
I started my firm to help communities across the country realize their own potential to improve everything about the quality of life for their people .PERIOD <BREAK>
Hometown security is next on my to-do list .PERIOD <BREAK>
The first few systems that we created ,COMMA they kind of worked .PERIOD <BREAK>
So she expresses here what it's like to see someone halfway across the world having taken your idea ,COMMA built upon it and then acknowledging you for contributing .PERIOD <BREAK>
And he was a clever man .PERIOD He sort of said ,COMMA Well ,COMMA that's OK ,COMMA but you've done very well in your math SATs .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's taken at three o'clock in the morning ,COMMA without the permission of the company .PERIOD <BREAK>
This picture was taken in 1982 ,COMMA just before the IBM PC was even announced .PERIOD <BREAK>
And when people tell me ,COMMA Who's going to teach the teachers to teach the kids ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
What he observed was that kids who write computer programs understand things differently ,COMMA and when they debug the programs ,COMMA they come the closest to learning about learning .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is in the early 2000 s .PERIOD My son ,COMMA Dimitri -- who's here ,COMMA many of you know Dimitri -- went to Cambodia ,COMMA set up this school that we had built ,COMMA just as the school connected it to the Internet .PERIOD <BREAK>
I can see any head of state ,COMMA any executive I want ,COMMA at any time ,COMMA because I'm not selling laptops .PERIOD OK ?QUESTIONMARK I have no shareholders .PERIOD <BREAK>
If you look at our professional services ,COMMA including search firms ,COMMA including communications ,COMMA including legal services ,COMMA including banking ,COMMA they're all pro bono .PERIOD And it's not to save money .PERIOD <BREAK>
Dual-mode display -- that sunlight display's fantastic .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that was really critical .PERIOD The mesh network ,COMMA it'll become commonplace .PERIOD <BREAK>
It wasn't just to kind of make it cute ,COMMA because somebody -- you know ,COMMA good design is very important .PERIOD <BREAK>
If you're in a desert ,COMMA they can talk to each other about two kilometers apart .PERIOD <BREAK>
Use your mailing lists .PERIOD People in this room have extraordinary mailing lists .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the world production today ,COMMA everybody combined ,COMMA making laptops ,COMMA is five million a month .PERIOD So I'm standing here telling you that sometime next year ,COMMA we're going to make 20 percent of the world production .PERIOD <BREAK>
Computers sort of came around through games and toys .PERIOD <BREAK>
And you know ,COMMA the first computer most people had in the house may have been a computer to play Pong ,COMMA a little microprocessor embedded ,COMMA and then other games that came after that .PERIOD <BREAK>
Yeah ,COMMA there's 38 million of them sold worldwide .PERIOD <BREAK>
Don't worry ,COMMA relax ,COMMA no ,COMMA relax ,COMMA it's a robot ,COMMA it's smart !EXCLAMATIONMARK <BREAK>
It can withstand a 400 G shock .PERIOD The robot has local intelligence :COLON it can flip itself over ,COMMA can get itself into communication range ,COMMA can go upstairs by itself ,COMMA et cetera .PERIOD <BREAK>
We had the robots down at the World Trade Center late that evening .PERIOD <BREAK>
So one year ago ,COMMA the US military didn't have these robots .PERIOD <BREAK>
He sort of does that .PERIOD But I'm going to -- Chris Anderson :COLON I'm just British .PERIOD RB :COLON Oh .PERIOD <BREAK>
Okay .PERIOD He's pretty good .PERIOD Yeah .PERIOD Good ,COMMA good ,COMMA good .PERIOD <BREAK>
And at different places in that space ,COMMA it expresses -- can we have the volume on here ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Kismet :COLON Do you really think so ?QUESTIONMARK Do you really think so ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Voice :COLON Look at my smile .PERIOD <BREAK>
Voice :COLON No .PERIOD No .PERIOD You're not to do that .PERIOD No .PERIOD <BREAK>
We don't know whether he understood or not that the robot -- Notice the turn-taking .PERIOD <BREAK>
After all ,COMMA that's certainly what modern molecular biology says about us .PERIOD <BREAK>
And for those of you that have teenagers ,COMMA you know what that's like .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I don't think -- -- I don't think we're going to deliberately build robots that we're uncomfortable with .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the watchmaker turned around and said ,COMMA God can see it .PERIOD <BREAK>
But I felt something .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now you probably know the answer to this already .PERIOD <BREAK>
I remember it clearly .PERIOD <BREAK>
I thought ,COMMA well what the hell's that about ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Now I'm not a neuroscientist .PERIOD <BREAK>
And how much of that reactive side of it is due to what we already know ,COMMA or what we're going to learn ,COMMA about something ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And as we assemble these tools ,COMMA from a design point of view ,COMMA I get terribly excited about it ,COMMA because these are things ,COMMA as we've already said ,COMMA they're arriving at the brain ,COMMA it would seem ,COMMA before cognition ,COMMA before we can manipulate them -- electrochemical party tricks .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now when talking about beauty you can't get away from the fact that a lot experiments have been done in this way with faces and what have you .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'm not getting it off the eyebrow .PERIOD <BREAK>
Anais Nin and the Talmud have told us time and time again that we see things not as they are ,COMMA but as we are .PERIOD <BREAK>
Ahhhh .PERIOD <BREAK>
But I also know why it's exquisite to me ,COMMA because it's a palimpsest of things .PERIOD <BREAK>
I mean ,COMMA if I just go through some of them now -- I know about laminar flow when it comes to air-piercing objects ,COMMA and that does it consummately well ,COMMA you can see it can .PERIOD <BREAK>
Why would you do that ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Beautiful ?QUESTIONMARK Maybe lesser .PERIOD <BREAK>
Underneath this ,COMMA like the story of the swan ,COMMA is a million things very difficult to do .PERIOD <BREAK>
So all hail to that .PERIOD <BREAK>
The knowledge bubble that sits around the outside ,COMMA the stuff that costs nothing ,COMMA because that knowledge is free -- bundle that together and where do we come out ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And so I've stopped using words like form ,COMMA and I've stopped using words like function as a designer .PERIOD <BREAK>
And for the last decade or so ,COMMA it's been quite clear what being an atheist means .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now I think it's too easy .PERIOD <BREAK>
And what I'd like to inaugurate today is a new way of being an atheist -- if you like ,COMMA a new version of atheism we could call Atheism 20 .PERIOD <BREAK>
I really like the art of Mantegna .PERIOD <BREAK>
I think there is an alternative .PERIOD <BREAK>
We have secularized badly ,COMMA I would argue .PERIOD <BREAK>
You know the kind of thing a commencement address is ,COMMA and graduation ceremonies ,COMMA those lyrical claims that education ,COMMA the process of education -- particularly higher education -- will make us into nobler and better human beings .PERIOD <BREAK>
We need data ,COMMA we don't need help .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so we need guidance and we need didactic learning .PERIOD <BREAK>
they'd go ,COMMA No ,COMMA no .PERIOD I don't need one of those .PERIOD <BREAK>
Well a sermon wants to change your life and a lecture wants to give you a bit of information .PERIOD <BREAK>
Otherwise our minds are like sieves .PERIOD <BREAK>
We associate repetition with boredom .PERIOD <BREAK>
We're just going to run through all the old ones and watch them five times because they're so true .PERIOD <BREAK>
The other things that religions do is to arrange time .PERIOD <BREAK>
All the major religions give us calendars .PERIOD <BREAK>
You won't do that by accident ;SEMICOLON you will do that because you are guided to do that .PERIOD <BREAK>
In the secular world we think ,COMMA If an idea is important ,COMMA I'll bump into it .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's very good .PERIOD <BREAK>
In the secular world ,COMMA you can come through the university system and be a lousy speaker and still have a great career .PERIOD <BREAK>
What you're saying needs to be backed up by a really convincing way of saying it .PERIOD <BREAK>
After every convincing point ,COMMA people will go ,COMMA Amen ,COMMA amen ,COMMA amen .PERIOD <BREAK>
At the end of a really rousing paragraph ,COMMA they'll all stand up ,COMMA and they'll go ,COMMA Thank you Jesus ,COMMA thank you Christ ,COMMA thank you Savior .PERIOD <BREAK>
Religions are fascinating in the way they try and combine the two .PERIOD <BREAK>
We sometimes hear it said that museums are our new cathedrals ,COMMA or our new churches .PERIOD <BREAK>
Art is about two things in all the major faiths .PERIOD <BREAK>
And if that thing is good ,COMMA there's no problem with it at all .PERIOD <BREAK>
Art should be didactic .PERIOD <BREAK>
Whereas the people who are selling us the higher stuff -- the therapists ,COMMA the poets -- are on their own and they have no power ,COMMA they have no might .PERIOD <BREAK>
But you left out one aspect of religion that a lot of people might say your agenda could borrow from ,COMMA which is this sense -- that's actually probably the most important thing to anyone who's religious -- of spiritual experience ,COMMA of some kind of connection with something that's bigger than you are .PERIOD <BREAK>
Is there any room for that experience in Atheism 20 ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
I would say that there are many ,COMMA many gaps in secular life and these can be plugged .PERIOD <BREAK>
And as it happened ,COMMA I read it from midnight to five in the morning in one shot .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is one of the largest underground labs in the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
There is another way to search for dark matter ,COMMA which is indirectly .PERIOD <BREAK>
When a neutrino hits a water molecule it emits a kind of blue light ,COMMA a flash of blue light ,COMMA and by looking for this blue light ,COMMA you can essentially understand something about the neutrino and then ,COMMA indirectly ,COMMA something about the dark matter that might have created this neutrino .PERIOD <BREAK>
But nonetheless ,COMMA it's an extraordinary piece of engineering .PERIOD <BREAK>
Here's another view of the same .PERIOD <BREAK>
The reason why you have to build these telescopes in places like the Atacama Desert is because of the high altitude desert .PERIOD <BREAK>
And remember ,COMMA all this wiring is being done by people in extreme cold ,COMMA in sub-zero temperatures .PERIOD <BREAK>
They're wearing about 15 kg of clothing and stuff ,COMMA but they have to take their gloves off in order to do that .PERIOD <BREAK>
Anil Ananthaswamy :COLON And I'll finally like to leave you with two images .PERIOD <BREAK>
They're going to learn from whatever it is they have around them .PERIOD <BREAK>
It is ,COMMA by far and away ,COMMA the largest print library in the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
Then the question is ,COMMA what do you get ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
It's starting to be a little bit more specified .PERIOD <BREAK>
But I have to say that there's older technologies that I tend to like .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it turns out to not be very hard .PERIOD <BREAK>
You can actually get really good-looking books for on the order of one penny per page ,COMMA sort of the parts cost for doing this .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so we've tried that ,COMMA and I'll go over that in a moment .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it's called the Espresso Book Machine ,COMMA and in about 10 minutes ,COMMA you can press a button and make a book .PERIOD <BREAK>
And one of my favorites in this is the $ 100 laptop .PERIOD <BREAK>
If you really care about books ,COMMA you're going to scan them better ,COMMA especially if they're valuable books .PERIOD <BREAK>
So all in all ,COMMA that's going very well .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so we're starting up a program to do out-of-print works ,COMMA but loaning them .PERIOD <BREAK>
But it is within our grasp ,COMMA technologically and law-wise ,COMMA at least for the out of print and out of copyright ,COMMA we suggest ,COMMA to be able to get the whole darn thing online .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's sort of the biggest TiVo box you've ever seen .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's about a petabyte ,COMMA so far ,COMMA of worldwide television -- Russian ,COMMA Chinese ,COMMA Japanese ,COMMA Iraqi ,COMMA Al Jazeera ,COMMA BBC ,COMMA CNN ,COMMA ABC ,COMMA CBS ,COMMA NBC -- 24 hours a day .PERIOD <BREAK>
So we've got about 100000 pieces up there .PERIOD <BREAK>
And actually ,COMMA it's really been pioneered by Alexa Internet ,COMMA which donates this collection to the Internet Archive .PERIOD <BREAK>
If we go and put it in a couple more places ,COMMA I think we'll be in good shape .PERIOD <BREAK>
You'll eat countless gourmet meals .PERIOD <BREAK>
Not likely .PERIOD <BREAK>
And this ,COMMA and then this .PERIOD <BREAK>
Day 21 ,COMMA day 23 ,COMMA day 25 .PERIOD <BREAK>
Fungi don't like to rot from bacteria ,COMMA and so our best antibiotics come from fungi .PERIOD <BREAK>
How is that possible ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
The tallest plants on Earth at that time were less than two feet .PERIOD <BREAK>
The Earth was struck by an asteroid ,COMMA a huge amount of debris was jettisoned into the atmosphere .PERIOD <BREAK>
We were involved with several experiments .PERIOD <BREAK>
There were four piles saturated with diesel and other petroleum waste :COLON one was a control pile ;SEMICOLON one pile was treated with enzymes ;SEMICOLON one pile was treated with bacteria ;SEMICOLON and our pile we inoculated with mushroom mycelium .PERIOD <BREAK>
The mycelium is producing enzymes -- peroxidases -- that break carbon-hydrogen bonds .PERIOD <BREAK>
So I invented burlap sacks ,COMMA bunker spawn -- and putting the mycelium -- using storm blown debris ,COMMA you can take these burlap sacks and put them downstream from a farm that's producing E .PERIOD coli ,COMMA or other wastes ,COMMA or a factory with chemical toxins ,COMMA and it leads to habitat restoration .PERIOD <BREAK>
There's more than a 100 million colonies per gram ,COMMA and 10 to the third power is around 1000 .PERIOD <BREAK>
In 48 hours to 72 hours ,COMMA these three mushroom species reduced the amount of coliform bacteria 10000 times .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is a space-conservative method that uses storm debris -- and we can guarantee that we will have storms every year .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA this one mushroom ,COMMA in particular ,COMMA has drawn our interest over time .PERIOD <BREAK>
And a few years ago ,COMMA we received these results .PERIOD <BREAK>
10 or greater are considered to be very active .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so ,COMMA for the first time ,COMMA I am showing this .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we're using a natural extract within the same dosage window as a pure pharmaceutical .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA I went to the EPA homepage ,COMMA and they were recommending studies with metarhizium species of a group of fungi that kill carpenter ants ,COMMA as well as termites .PERIOD <BREAK>
The Life Box -- you're gonna be getting a DVD of the TED conference -- you add soil ,COMMA you add water ,COMMA you have mycorrhizal and endophytic fungi as well as spores ,COMMA like of the Agarikon mushroom .PERIOD <BREAK>
The seeds then are mothered by this mycelium .PERIOD <BREAK>
I've also lived in Biosphere 2 .PERIOD <BREAK>
Well ,COMMA in 1991 it was finally time for us to go in and try out this baby .PERIOD <BREAK>
The day I walked into Biosphere 2 ,COMMA I was ,COMMA for the first time ,COMMA breathing a completely different atmosphere than everybody else in the world ,COMMA except seven other people .PERIOD <BREAK>
We were taking their biomass ,COMMA storing them in the basement ,COMMA growing plants ,COMMA going around ,COMMA around ,COMMA around ,COMMA trying to take all of that carbon out of the atmosphere .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we had no clue where it was .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that you literally do that .PERIOD You stop breathing and then you -- -- take a breath and it wakes you up .PERIOD And it's very irritating .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I recoiled .PERIOD They stank !EXCLAMATIONMARK <BREAK>
People stink !EXCLAMATIONMARK <BREAK>
I had no idea what was in my food ,COMMA where it came from .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so we sent one onto the Mir Space Station .PERIOD <BREAK>
Shrimp farms are a scourge on the earth ,COMMA frankly ,COMMA from an environmental point of view .PERIOD <BREAK>
And understand its interactions with the entire Earth .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now it may not seem like it ,COMMA but we are .PERIOD <BREAK>
Thank you .PERIOD <BREAK>
What I'd like you to do is ,COMMA just really quickly ,COMMA is just ,COMMA sort of ,COMMA nod to the person on your right ,COMMA and then nod to the person on your left .PERIOD <BREAK>
And one documentary writer ,COMMA who was here and looked at this two months after I was here ,COMMA described this not as beehives but as a graveyard ,COMMA with these empty white boxes with no bees left in them .PERIOD <BREAK>
It was called that because a guy in Israel first found it ,COMMA and he now regrets profoundly calling it that disease ,COMMA because ,COMMA of course ,COMMA there's the implication .PERIOD <BREAK>
We needed beeswax for a project we were working on ;SEMICOLON he was so capable ,COMMA he was able to render the nicest block of beeswax I have ever seen from cow dung ,COMMA tin cans and his veil ,COMMA which he used as a screening ,COMMA right in this meadow .PERIOD And so that ingenuity is inspiring .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we see these families ,COMMA these nomadic families ,COMMA you know ,COMMA father to son ,COMMA father to son ,COMMA and these guys are hurting .PERIOD <BREAK>
We have bumblebees on the top .PERIOD <BREAK>
Dennis vanEngelsdorp :COLON Bee .PERIOD Okay ,COMMA thanks .PERIOD <BREAK>
And in fact ,COMMA there is now a red list of pollinators that we're worried have disappeared ,COMMA and on top of that list are a lot of these kleptoparasites ,COMMA but also these bumblebees .PERIOD <BREAK>
There are other animals that pollinate ,COMMA like bats ,COMMA and bats are in trouble too .PERIOD <BREAK>
But I'm glad to say that I think we know the cause of all these conditions ,COMMA and that cause is NDD :COLON Nature Deficit Disorder .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that is ,COMMA make meadows and not lawns .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA not all of us have meadows ,COMMA or lawns that we can convert ,COMMA and so you can always ,COMMA of course ,COMMA grow a meadow in a pot .PERIOD <BREAK>
And everyone should open a beehive ,COMMA because it is the most amazing ,COMMA incredible thing .PERIOD <BREAK>
And if we want to cure ourselves of NDD ,COMMA or Nature Deficit Disorder ,COMMA I think this is a great way of doing it .PERIOD <BREAK>
She Googled ,COMMA and she found this World Whistling Championship in America ,COMMA of course .PERIOD <BREAK>
Okay ,COMMA I'm not the only one whistling here .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I want to first rehearse with you your whistling .PERIOD <BREAK>
I start it myself .PERIOD <BREAK>
But there is a much more fundamental mistake in the overall story of the ark that's not reported here .PERIOD <BREAK>
So now we have God that is going to submerge Earth permanently or at least for a very long period ,COMMA and no one is taking care of plants .PERIOD <BREAK>
Why ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
This is not the common man .PERIOD <BREAK>
You know very well about professors .PERIOD <BREAK>
When he speaks about animals ,COMMA [he] tends to remove the fact that plants exist .PERIOD <BREAK>
The blue whale ,COMMA the biggest creature that exists on the planet -- that is wrong ,COMMA completely wrong .PERIOD <BREAK>
Some of them are much more sophisticated .PERIOD <BREAK>
Many insects have been used by plants as vectors for the transport of the pollination ,COMMA but not just insects ;SEMICOLON even birds ,COMMA reptiles ,COMMA and mammals like bats rats are normally used for the transportation of the pollen .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is a serious business .PERIOD <BREAK>
So we studied the root apex and we found that there is a specific region that is here ,COMMA depicted in blue -- that is called the transition zone .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now we know that a root apex has just a few hundred cells that show this kind of feature ,COMMA but we know how big the root apparatus of a small plant ,COMMA like a plant of rye .PERIOD <BREAK>
They work in the same way .PERIOD <BREAK>
Well ,COMMA if you want to fly ,COMMA it's good that you look at birds -- to be inspired by birds .PERIOD <BREAK>
But if you want to explore soils ,COMMA or if you want to colonize new territory ,COMMA to best thing that you can do is to be inspired by plants that are masters in doing this .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's much more easy to work with plants than with animals .PERIOD <BREAK>
Thank you .PERIOD <BREAK>
She's being filmed with a hidden camera .PERIOD <BREAK>
So she's noticed the unusual thing ,COMMA but she's gone back to her normal life .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we've continued to do it every year .PERIOD <BREAK>
Looking at the entire facade -- there were 70 total windows -- and I knew what I had to do .PERIOD <BREAK>
So then I gave a new hand signal ,COMMA which signaled the next soloist down below in Forever 21 ,COMMA and he danced .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is the Best Buy in New York City .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it's a very depressing place to be in the morning ,COMMA it's very crowded .PERIOD <BREAK>
The participants at Improv Everywhere events have just as much leisure time as any other New Yorkers ,COMMA they just occasionally choose to spend it in an unusual way .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I think that's sort of the point of Improv Everywhere .PERIOD <BREAK>
There was no way to predict how far it would spread through water supplies and how bad the situation would get .PERIOD <BREAK>
It doesn't require any special training .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's a quite wonderfully designed animal .PERIOD <BREAK>
They have become domesticated ,COMMA and human beings have been redesigning their religions for thousands of years .PERIOD <BREAK>
Because what I've been doing for the last four years ,COMMA really since the first time you saw me -- some of you saw me at TED when I was talking about religion ,COMMA and in the last four years I've been working just about non-stop on this topic .PERIOD <BREAK>
And you might say it's about the reverse engineering of religions .PERIOD <BREAK>
And ,COMMA as with the cow ,COMMA there's a mixture of evolutionary design ,COMMA designed by natural selection itself ,COMMA and intelligent design -- more or less intelligent design -- and redesigned by human beings who are trying to redesign their religions .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's like a coin flip ;SEMICOLON it doesn't count really .PERIOD <BREAK>
Is it totalitarian to require reading ,COMMA writing and arithmetic ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
I know many religions are so anxious about preserving the purity of their faith among their children that they are intent on keeping their children ignorant of other faiths .PERIOD <BREAK>
This picture ,COMMA which I pulled off the web -- the fellow on the left is really an important part of this picture .PERIOD <BREAK>
It wasn't the cleverness of the sheep at all .PERIOD <BREAK>
If you understand Orgel's Second Rule ,COMMA then you understand why the Intelligent Design movement is basically a hoax .PERIOD <BREAK>
Again and again biologists are fascinated with the brilliance of what's discovered .PERIOD <BREAK>
But the process itself is without purpose ,COMMA without foresight ,COMMA without design .PERIOD <BREAK>
Well ,COMMA it's because its brain had been infected with a lancet fluke that was -- needed to get into the belly of a sheep or a cow in order to reproduce .PERIOD <BREAK>
The key to our domination of the planet is culture ,COMMA and the key to culture is religion .PERIOD <BREAK>
They'd want to know how it originated ,COMMA what it was for and how it perpetuates itself .PERIOD <BREAK>
In that case ,COMMA a parasite gets into a mouse and it needs to get into the belly of a cat .PERIOD <BREAK>
But I'm not just talking about Islam .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'm talking also about Christianity .PERIOD <BREAK>
You've all got a copy .PERIOD <BREAK>
You've just heard the man .PERIOD <BREAK>
First of all ,COMMA the goal .PERIOD <BREAK>
The book is clear ,COMMA vivid ,COMMA accessible ,COMMA beautifully formatted .PERIOD <BREAK>
Just enough repetition .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it would just be insincere of me not to address those problems .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's worth mentioning .PERIOD <BREAK>
You could stop reading this book because life would have no purpose or meaning or significance .PERIOD <BREAK>
But that is just a difference of opinion .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's not what I'm really worried about .PERIOD <BREAK>
And here I think ,COMMA Wait a minute .PERIOD <BREAK>
Is he endorsing creationism here ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Your mind can handle 15000 decisions a second .PERIOD <BREAK>
Well ,COMMA there's a sense which I agree with him ,COMMA except I think it has an evolutionary explanation .PERIOD <BREAK>
Whose truth are we going to listen to ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And here's one that does concern me .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I'd really like to get a response if Rick is able to do it .PERIOD <BREAK>
A very clever little meme .PERIOD <BREAK>
In fact ,COMMA all of you as you sit here right now are vibrating .PERIOD <BREAK>
Every part of your body is vibrating at different frequencies .PERIOD <BREAK>
It looks a bit like this .PERIOD <BREAK>
The trouble with widespread headphone use is it brings three really big health issues .PERIOD <BREAK>
It makes you tired and irritable to have to make up all of that data .PERIOD <BREAK>
You're having to imagine it .PERIOD <BREAK>
Professional hearing protectors are great ;SEMICOLON I use some all the time .PERIOD <BREAK>
The Elizabethans described language as decorated silence .PERIOD <BREAK>
Sound design is the future ,COMMA and I think it's the way we're going to change the way the world sounds .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's a fantastic antidote to schizophonia ;SEMICOLON to make music and sound in a group of people ,COMMA whichever style you enjoy particularly .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'm leaving you with a little more birdsong ,COMMA which is very good for you .PERIOD <BREAK>
We might one day see a shadow a black hole can cast on a very bright background ,COMMA but we haven't yet .PERIOD <BREAK>
Einstein realized that if space were empty ,COMMA if the universe were empty ,COMMA it would be like this picture ,COMMA except for maybe without the helpful grid drawn on it .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is the hardworking scientist under harsh conditions .PERIOD <BREAK>
He thought nature would protect us from their formation .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's actually not massive enough .PERIOD <BREAK>
It would be bad if we tried to fire our rockets and get out of there because we couldn't ,COMMA anymore than light can escape .PERIOD <BREAK>
Space squeezes and stretches as it emanates out from these black holes banging on the universe .PERIOD <BREAK>
Want to get away from the sound .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now that chirp is very characteristic of black holes merging -- that it chirps up at the end .PERIOD <BREAK>
There are very industrious experiments being built on Earth -- one called LIGO -- which will detect deviations in the squeezing and stretching of space at less than the fraction of a nucleus of an atom over four kilometers .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's everywhere ,COMMA it's all around you ,COMMA and the space is wobbling chaotically .PERIOD <BREAK>
Imagine a billion years ago ,COMMA two black holes collided .PERIOD <BREAK>
If it was the Big Bang we were going to pick up ,COMMA it would sound like this .PERIOD <BREAK>
And if we pick it up ,COMMA it will be music to our ears because it will be the quiet echo of that moment of our creation ,COMMA of our observable universe .PERIOD <BREAK>
And our prison system itself is stuck .PERIOD <BREAK>
Funds for education ,COMMA for training and for rehabilitation are declining ,COMMA so this despairing cycle of incarceration continues .PERIOD <BREAK>
We give science lectures ,COMMA and the men here are choosing to come to our science lectures instead of watching television or weightlifting .PERIOD <BREAK>
We partnered with the Nature Conservancy for inmates at Stafford Creek Correctional Center to grow endangered prairie plants for restoration of relic prairie areas in Washington state .PERIOD <BREAK>
And just recently ,COMMA we've begun to work with those men who are segregated in what we call Supermax facilities .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so what we see ,COMMA I think ,COMMA is that small ,COMMA collective movements of change can perhaps move an entity such as our own prison system in a direction of hope .PERIOD <BREAK>
It can't afford to doubt the person who tends the child .PERIOD <BREAK>
That implies a lot of trust .PERIOD <BREAK>
As the child grows ,COMMA it begins to discover that the person trusted is violating the trust .PERIOD <BREAK>
You can be compassionate occasionally ,COMMA more moved by empathy than by compassion .PERIOD <BREAK>
The tennis etiquette is ,COMMA both the players have to come to the net and shake hands .PERIOD <BREAK>
Compassion is not defined in one form .PERIOD <BREAK>
That means the whole universe ,COMMA known things and unknown things .PERIOD <BREAK>
There's no choice in this :COLON that only confirms the reality that the wholeness cannot be different from you ,COMMA cannot be minus you .PERIOD <BREAK>
You express yourself because you have compassion .PERIOD <BREAK>
There is no shortcut :COLON it is like swimming by swimming .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's interesting to me .PERIOD <BREAK>
You fake it and make it .PERIOD <BREAK>
If you know how to pray ,COMMA pray .PERIOD <BREAK>
Well ,COMMA it has its pluses and minuses .PERIOD <BREAK>
Therefore ,COMMA we don't find the moral ,COMMA emotional ,COMMA psychological and political space to distance ourselves from the reality of social responsibility .PERIOD <BREAK>
Oddly enough ,COMMA an artist such as myself finds herself also in the position of being the voice ,COMMA the speaker of my people ,COMMA even if I have ,COMMA indeed ,COMMA no access to my own country .PERIOD <BREAK>
We are there to take pride and insist on respect .PERIOD <BREAK>
I envy sometimes the artists of the West for their freedom of expression .PERIOD <BREAK>
Our people depend on our artists ,COMMA and culture is beyond communication .PERIOD <BREAK>
I work in Morocco ,COMMA in Turkey ,COMMA in Mexico .PERIOD <BREAK>
How to tell a political story but an allegorical story .PERIOD <BREAK>
What was most significant for me was ,COMMA once again ,COMMA the presence of the women .PERIOD <BREAK>
Start differentiating into effector and memory cells .PERIOD <BREAK>
We have a million students a month using the site ,COMMA watching on the order of 100 to 200000 videos a day .PERIOD <BREAK>
And then in a response to that same comment -- this is on the thread .PERIOD <BREAK>
But the paradigm here is ,COMMA we'll generate as many questions as you need until you get that concept ,COMMA until you get 10 in a row .PERIOD <BREAK>
In a traditional classroom ,COMMA you have a couple of homework ,COMMA homework ,COMMA lecture ,COMMA homework ,COMMA lecture ,COMMA and then you have a snapshot exam .PERIOD <BREAK>
But as ridiculous as that sounds ,COMMA that's exactly what's happening in our classrooms right now .PERIOD <BREAK>
So you can imagine -- and this is what we are working on -- is from this knowledge map you have logic ,COMMA you have computer programming ,COMMA you have grammar ,COMMA you have genetics ,COMMA all based off of that core of ,COMMA if you know this and that ,COMMA now you're ready for this next concept .PERIOD <BREAK>
It'll change what happens at the dinner table .PERIOD <BREAK>
Green means the student's already proficient .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the data gets pretty granular so you can see the exact problems that the student got right or wrong .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so the same kids that you thought were slow six weeks ago ,COMMA you now would think are gifted .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I think what you'll see emerging is this notion of a global one-world classroom .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'm still doing all the videos ,COMMA but we have a rockstar team doing the software .PERIOD <BREAK>
And they're doing it at the district level .PERIOD <BREAK>
And they're literally saying ,COMMA Hey ,COMMA this is nice ,COMMA but .PERIOD Like that focus graph ,COMMA a lot of the teachers said ,COMMA I have a feeling that a lot of the kids are jumping around and not focusing on one topic .PERIOD <BREAK>
But yeah ,COMMA it's all there .PERIOD <BREAK>
And seeing with the brain is often called imagination .PERIOD <BREAK>
So I am going to be talking about hallucinations ,COMMA and a particular sort of visual hallucination which I see among my patients .PERIOD <BREAK>
Animals too .PERIOD <BREAK>
I see cats and dogs walking towards me .PERIOD <BREAK>
She said ,COMMA It's got color .PERIOD It's got motion .PERIOD <BREAK>
I said ,COMMA There is a special form of visual hallucination which may go with deteriorating vision or blindness .PERIOD <BREAK>
And you have Charles Bonnet syndrome .PERIOD <BREAK>
And about 10 percent of the visually impaired people get visual hallucinations .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now with the original description in the 18 th century ,COMMA Charles Bonnet did not have them .PERIOD <BREAK>
On one occasion ,COMMA he saw a man in a bathrobe smoking a pipe ,COMMA and realized it was himself .PERIOD <BREAK>
These cartoons would be transparent and would cover half the visual field ,COMMA like a screen .PERIOD <BREAK>
But what did disturb her was she got very persistent images or hallucinations of faces and as with Rosalie ,COMMA the faces were often deformed ,COMMA with very large teeth or very large eyes .PERIOD <BREAK>
In particular ,COMMA the notion is that if you see things or hear things ,COMMA you're going mad ,COMMA but the psychotic hallucinations are quite different .PERIOD <BREAK>
And in particular ,COMMA one area of the temporal lobe is called the fusiform gyrus .PERIOD <BREAK>
And now we know that there are hundreds of other sorts of cells ,COMMA which can be very ,COMMA very specific .PERIOD <BREAK>
Well ,COMMA I've more or less said what I wanted .PERIOD <BREAK>
But they stop there .PERIOD <BREAK>
Well they don't disturb me any more than my tinnitus ,COMMA which I ignore .PERIOD <BREAK>
They occasionally interest me ,COMMA and I have many pictures of them in my notebooks .PERIOD <BREAK>
So it's a little-appreciated fact that most of the animals in our ocean make light .PERIOD <BREAK>
I've spent most of my career studying this phenomenon called bioluminescence .PERIOD <BREAK>
I also use it as a tool for visualizing and tracking pollution .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is the first time it has ever been recorded .PERIOD <BREAK>
So that light was made by a bioluminescent dinoflagellate ,COMMA a single-celled alga .PERIOD <BREAK>
There's a lot of animals that use this trick ,COMMA for example this black dragonfish .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's got a light organ under its eye .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's a scream for help ;SEMICOLON it's meant to attract attention .PERIOD <BREAK>
There's other ways you can defend yourself with light .PERIOD <BREAK>
This little squid is called the fire shooter because of its ability to do this .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is a golden coral ,COMMA a bush .PERIOD <BREAK>
We're talking to something .PERIOD <BREAK>
But he's persistent .PERIOD <BREAK>
We need more eyes on the process .PERIOD <BREAK>
Scientists have always created pictures as part of their thinking and discovery process .PERIOD <BREAK>
In the top left-hand corner ,COMMA you've got this yellow-green area .PERIOD <BREAK>
And those red molecules are hemoglobin .PERIOD <BREAK>
And hemoglobin acts as a molecular sponge to soak up the oxygen in your lungs and then carry it to other parts of the body .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that's how I really began .PERIOD So let's begin .PERIOD <BREAK>
Those are the letters of genetic code ,COMMA the 25000 genes you've got written in your DNA .PERIOD <BREAK>
But they physically run in opposite directions ,COMMA which creates a number of complications for your living cells ,COMMA as you're about to see ,COMMA most particularly when DNA is being copied .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so what I'm about to show you is an accurate representation of the actual DNA replication machine that's occurring right now inside your body ,COMMA at least 2002 biology .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it's jiggling and wiggling there because of the surrounding soup of molecules ,COMMA which I've stripped away so you can see something .PERIOD <BREAK>
But in each one of your cells ,COMMA each strand of DNA is about 30 to 40 million nanometers long .PERIOD <BREAK>
It is made up of about 200 different types of proteins ,COMMA thousands of proteins in total .PERIOD <BREAK>
That is the signal broadcasting system sending out the stop signal .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is how you work at the molecular scale .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we don't know exactly how they did this ,COMMA although they must have solved some collective action problems ;SEMICOLON it only makes sense that you can't hunt mastodons while you're fighting with the other groups .PERIOD <BREAK>
So that raised a social question that I believe must have driven new social forms .PERIOD <BREAK>
Again ,COMMA we can't know ,COMMA but we can be pretty sure that some form of symbolic communication must have been involved .PERIOD <BREAK>
We saw scientific revolutions ,COMMA the Protestant Reformation ,COMMA constitutional democracies possible where they had not been possible before .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'm going to talk briefly about two of them :COLON the prisoner's dilemma and the tragedy of the commons .PERIOD <BREAK>
Garrett Hardin used it to talk about overpopulation in the late 1960 s .PERIOD <BREAK>
And most recently ,COMMA neurophysiological measures have shown that people who punish cheaters in economic games show activity in the reward centers of their brain .PERIOD <BREAK>
Jim Surowiecki briefly mentioned Yochai Benkler's paper about open source ,COMMA pointing to a new form of production :COLON peer-to-peer production .PERIOD <BREAK>
Toyota ,COMMA instead of treating its suppliers as a marketplace ,COMMA treats them as a network and trains them to produce better ,COMMA even though they are also training them to produce better for their competitors .PERIOD <BREAK>
I don't think we've even begun to discover what the basic principles are ,COMMA but I think we can begin to think about them .PERIOD <BREAK>
I believe that the payoff would be very big .PERIOD <BREAK>
What forms of suffering could be alleviated ,COMMA what forms of wealth could be created if we knew a little bit more about cooperation ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
I don't think that this transdisciplinary discourse is automatically going to happen ;SEMICOLON it's going to require effort .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'm not going to dive into them either ,COMMA but photosynths are integrated into the map .PERIOD <BREAK>
So this is something that we're now going to try for the first time ,COMMA live ,COMMA and this is really ,COMMA truly ,COMMA very frightening .PERIOD <BREAK>
No ,COMMA no .PERIOD The other way .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is the current -- thank you -- this is the current time .PERIOD If we scrub the time ,COMMA then we can see how the sky will look at different times ,COMMA and we can get all of this very detailed information about different times ,COMMA different dates :COLON Let's move the moon a little higher in the sky ,COMMA maybe change the date .PERIOD <BREAK>
All right now ,COMMA I've overrun my time ,COMMA so I've got to stop .PERIOD <BREAK>
Sophal Ear :COLON So ,COMMA notwithstanding the 1970 s narration ,COMMA on April 17 th 1975 we lived in Phnom Penh .PERIOD <BREAK>
They were young soldiers ,COMMA typically child soldiers .PERIOD <BREAK>
So the Khmer Rouge took us from a place called Pursat to Kaoh Tiev ,COMMA which is across from the border from Vietnam .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we end up in Hong Ngu on the Vietnamese side .PERIOD <BREAK>
And then onwards to Chau Doc .PERIOD <BREAK>
Thank you mother .PERIOD <BREAK>
Somebody has to be a witness to what has happened to you .PERIOD <BREAK>
And one evening ,COMMA I was sitting next to a very nice gentleman in Kabul ,COMMA and he asked what I thought would be good in Afghanistan .PERIOD <BREAK>
This was our sign -- it's hand-painted ,COMMA and we had 45 all over Kabul .PERIOD <BREAK>
We developed a culturally-sensitive psycho-social counseling approach .PERIOD <BREAK>
And now you are helping me to regain some confidence in the future .PERIOD <BREAK>
Child :COLON There is no difference here between classes ,COMMA nor white or black ,COMMA nor if you have money or not .PERIOD <BREAK>
Simply ,COMMA if you are talented ,COMMA if you have the vocation and the will to be here ,COMMA you get in .PERIOD You share with us and make music .PERIOD <BREAK>
In its essence ,COMMA the orchestra and the choir are much more than artistic structures .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's how they build a spirit of solidarity and fraternity among them ,COMMA develop their self-esteem and foster the ethical and aesthetical values related to the music in all its senses .PERIOD <BREAK>
All this makes up a constructive and ascending social dynamic .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's what makes a little girl play the clarinet at home ,COMMA while her mother does the housework .PERIOD <BREAK>
And these will be some simple design qualities and they will also be some qualities of ,COMMA if you will ,COMMA the intelligence of interaction .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now we've put people 18 inches in front of a TV ,COMMA and all the artifacts that none of the original designers expected to be seen ,COMMA all of a sudden ,COMMA are staring you in the face :COLON the shadow mask ,COMMA the scan lines ,COMMA all of that .PERIOD <BREAK>
And my favorite example is always fingers .PERIOD <BREAK>
In fact ,COMMA they're not :COLON it's really a very ,COMMA very high-resolution input medium -- you have to just do it twice ,COMMA you have to touch the screen and then rotate your finger slightly -- and you can move a cursor with great accuracy .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we have never known how to do this technically ,COMMA so this slide is a fake slide .PERIOD <BREAK>
OK .PERIOD So there is the pressure-sensitive display in operation .PERIOD <BREAK>
The person's just ,COMMA if you will ,COMMA pushing on the screen to make a curve .PERIOD <BREAK>
And what you can do -- oops ,COMMA I didn't mean to do that -- what you can do is actually feed back to the user the feeling of the physical properties .PERIOD <BREAK>
What I'll show you very quickly is a new kind of book where it is mixed now with .PERIOD all sorts of things live in there ,COMMA but you have to keep a few things in mind .PERIOD <BREAK>
So it knows ,COMMA or at least there is computer-readable information in the medium itself .PERIOD It's just not a static movie frame .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA that would be ,COMMA if you will ,COMMA the top green track ,COMMA which doesn't mean too much .PERIOD But you might have to elaborate for me or for somebody who isn't an expert ,COMMA and say ,COMMA Cook at 380 degrees for 45 minutes .PERIOD <BREAK>
If you're in a classroom situation and somebody asks a question ,COMMA the last thing you do is repeat what you just said .PERIOD <BREAK>
He says ,COMMA Well ,COMMA reading is this junk they give me in little books to read .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that story has many other anecdotes that are similar ,COMMA but wow .PERIOD The key to the future of computers in education is right there ,COMMA and it is :COLON when does it mean something to a child ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
What the truth is is that speaking has great value to a child ;SEMICOLON the child can get a great deal by talking to you .PERIOD <BREAK>
Well ,COMMA in Senegal we found that this was the traditional classroom :COLON 120 kids -- three per desk -- one teacher ,COMMA a little bit of chalk .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's what meant something to her ,COMMA is doing the hair pattern ,COMMA and actually did it within two days -- an hour each day -- and found it was ,COMMA to her ,COMMA absolutely the most meaningful piece .PERIOD <BREAK>
And my last example -- as some of my former colleagues ,COMMA whom I see in the room ,COMMA can imagine what it will be .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA that is sufficiently zany that we would ,COMMA obviously ,COMMA jump to the bait ,COMMA and we did .PERIOD <BREAK>
So if I ,COMMA all of a sudden ,COMMA turn to the person to my left and start talking to that person ,COMMA then at the person to my right's site ,COMMA he'll see these two plastic heads talking to each other .PERIOD <BREAK>
And then if that person interrupts ,COMMA then those two heads may turn .PERIOD <BREAK>
We're testing these kinds of simple sensor-network technologies in the home so that any phone that a senior is already comfortable with can help them deal with their medications .PERIOD <BREAK>
And as we monitor phone usage by seniors over a long period of time ,COMMA down to the tenths of a microsecond ,COMMA that recognition moment of whether they can figure out that person on the other end is a friend and we start talking to them immediately ,COMMA or they do a lot of what's called trouble talk ,COMMA where they're like ,COMMA Wait ,COMMA who is this ?QUESTIONMARK Oh .PERIOD Right ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
So ,COMMA sensors are looking at that kind of voice .PERIOD <BREAK>
If they have a hip fracture we go with them and we study their entire discharge experience .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is 50 tsunamis scheduled on the calendar ,COMMA but somehow we can't sort of marshal our government and innovative forces to sort of get out in front of it and do something about it .PERIOD We'll wait until it's more of a catastrophe ,COMMA and react ,COMMA as opposed to prepare for it .PERIOD <BREAK>
This mentality of traveling to and timesharing large ,COMMA expensive healthcare systems actually began in 1787 .PERIOD <BREAK>
We have to shift from this mainframe mentality of healthcare to a personal model of healthcare .PERIOD <BREAK>
How do we collect not just biological data but behavioral data ,COMMA psychological data ,COMMA relational data ,COMMA in and on and around the home ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
They fixed her back up .PERIOD She was never going to be able to move back into the assisted living .PERIOD They put her into the nursing home unit .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'm not bragging about how much we fund ;SEMICOLON it's how little anyone else actually pays attention to aging and funds innovation on aging ,COMMA chronic disease management and independent living in the home .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so that's what I've been striving for all of my life .PERIOD <BREAK>
But instead ,COMMA I go out and I find things .PERIOD <BREAK>
Then I just pick things up .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so ,COMMA at that time ,COMMA I was able to make some interesting hypotheses along with my colleagues .PERIOD <BREAK>
The appearance of them would have been different -- which it is in all social animals .PERIOD <BREAK>
In social groups of animals ,COMMA the juveniles always look different than the adults .PERIOD <BREAK>
And probably a whole bunch of trees as well .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now it wasn't DNA ;SEMICOLON she didn't find DNA .PERIOD <BREAK>
We gave samples to Mary Schweitzer ,COMMA and she was actually able to determine that B-rex was a female based on medullary tissue found on the inside of the bone .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so we built a laboratory in the back of an 18 -wheeler trailer ,COMMA and actually took the laboratory to the field where we could get better samples .PERIOD <BREAK>
I mean ,COMMA it was wonderful stuff .PERIOD <BREAK>
So that's what I'm here to tell you about :COLON how we are going to fix a chicken .PERIOD <BREAK>
We started out with a wolf-like creature and we ended up with a Maltese .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so that's what we're looking into .PERIOD <BREAK>
Archaeopteryx ,COMMA which is a bird ,COMMA a primitive bird ,COMMA still has that very primitive hand .PERIOD <BREAK>
It has the three fingers ,COMMA the three digits .PERIOD <BREAK>
Birds have basically rudimentary tails .PERIOD <BREAK>
But a gene turns on and resorbs the tail ,COMMA gets rid of it .PERIOD <BREAK>
And people always say ,COMMA Why do that ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
What the Frigoris you doing ?QUESTIONMARK Names are important .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA Frank is this clear to you ,COMMA Djabran Fluctus ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Listen ,COMMA I'm going back to the swamp mermaid .PERIOD Can you call me in a little while ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
So ,COMMA these are actual names of people that work there .PERIOD <BREAK>
I did some more investigation .PERIOD <BREAK>
There are some mapping people who do use their names .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA formulas relate number to form .PERIOD <BREAK>
They got little babies in there ,COMMA floating in there .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's a different kind of course .PERIOD And they've got five apples ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Because that's why we're here ,COMMA really ,COMMA I think to figure stuff out and to love each other .PERIOD <BREAK>
They are so different .PERIOD <BREAK>
Bode's law wasn't even his law .PERIOD It was a guy named Titus .PERIOD <BREAK>
Just a correlation that indicates how things are misinterpreted .PERIOD <BREAK>
Golden section ,COMMA I've been obsessed with this thing since before I was born .PERIOD <BREAK>
I know that scares a lot of you ,COMMA but that was my purpose entirely .PERIOD <BREAK>
If Fibonacci had been on Paxil ,COMMA that would be the Fibonacci series .PERIOD <BREAK>
Yes ,COMMA Mama .PERIOD <BREAK>
There is so many intricate relationships that I'm not going to go there now ,COMMA because you would say ,COMMA Hey ,COMMA go back to the Fluctus part .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I'm presenting it here at TED .PERIOD Why ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
It just seems like it's not sexy and elegant ,COMMA it's hidden .PERIOD <BREAK>
And look at this ,COMMA built within it is the Golden Ratio .PERIOD <BREAK>
Thank you .PERIOD <BREAK>
Good afternoon .PERIOD <BREAK>
In 1982 ,COMMA in the middle of the Cold War in Soviet Siberia ,COMMA a pipeline exploded with a burst of 3 kilotons ,COMMA the equivalent of a fourth of the Hiroshima bomb .PERIOD <BREAK>
And with these keys ,COMMA they may have been able to get inside CENTCOM's systems ,COMMA to see and hear everything ,COMMA and maybe even infect some of them .PERIOD <BREAK>
As a result ,COMMA the Americans take the threat very seriously .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'll quote General James Cartwright ,COMMA Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff ,COMMA who says in a report to Congress that cyberattacks could be as powerful as weapons of mass destruction .PERIOD <BREAK>
Moreover ,COMMA the Americans have decided to spend over 30 billion dollars in the next five years to build up their cyberwar capabilities .PERIOD <BREAK>
Cyber weapons have this peculiar feature :COLON they can be used without leaving traces .PERIOD <BREAK>
Cartoons are basically short stories .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that prompted people to make maps like this ,COMMA with all kinds of wonderful detail on the land ,COMMA but when you get to the waters edge ,COMMA the ocean looks like one giant puddle of blue paint .PERIOD <BREAK>
And best of all ,COMMA I saw the animals .PERIOD <BREAK>
Could you image if we looked through the Hubble Telescope and we saw that ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
It would start a whole new space race .PERIOD <BREAK>
For instance ,COMMA take these sea turtles .PERIOD <BREAK>
They kind of have a sixth sense like Superman's x-ray vision .PERIOD <BREAK>
They can sense the magnetic fields of the earth .PERIOD <BREAK>
Or take this sea cucumber .PERIOD <BREAK>
He's sort of a Homer Simpson with fins .PERIOD <BREAK>
He goes down and he meets this famous anglerfish .PERIOD <BREAK>
The third storyline I did about a year and a half ago was probably my most difficult .PERIOD <BREAK>
I do three or four strips after that where we explore the finning issue and the shark fin soup issue .PERIOD <BREAK>
There was a real website based in China that actually sold shark fins ,COMMA so I kind of exposed that .PERIOD <BREAK>
And you see you have a beautiful piece of white alabaster .PERIOD <BREAK>
So you say to yourself ,COMMA Well ,COMMA that's worth something .PERIOD <BREAK>
So you go back into the room ,COMMA and you break this thing to pieces ,COMMA and you haul it away .PERIOD <BREAK>
Thanks for listening .PERIOD <BREAK>
Audience :COLON 22 .PERIOD <BREAK>
Audience :COLON 47 .PERIOD <BREAK>
Woman :COLON No .PERIOD <BREAK>
594 .PERIOD Let's give three of them a nice round of applause there .PERIOD <BREAK>
What I'm going to try and do then -- I notice that took some of you a little bit of time to get your answer .PERIOD <BREAK>
Audience :COLON 23 .PERIOD <BREAK>
Audience :COLON 59 .PERIOD <BREAK>
95218564 ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Eight-digit capacity -- don't you hate that ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
In the meanwhile ,COMMA let me conclude the first part of my show by doing something a little trickier .PERIOD <BREAK>
Really scramble them up this time ,COMMA please .PERIOD <BREAK>
For my next number -- while I mentally recharge my batteries ,COMMA I have one more question for the audience .PERIOD <BREAK>
Let's see ,COMMA starting with -- let's start with a gentleman first ,COMMA OK sir ,COMMA what year was it ,COMMA first of all ?QUESTIONMARK That's why I start with a gentleman first .PERIOD <BREAK>
Yell it out ,COMMA what year ?QUESTIONMARK Audience :COLON 1959 .PERIOD <BREAK>
1959 ,COMMA OK -- and the month ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Audience :COLON May .PERIOD AB :COLON May what ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
It was .PERIOD AB :COLON And it was cloudy .PERIOD <BREAK>
57683 squared .PERIOD Yuck .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'm going to break the problem down into three parts .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'll do 57000 squared ,COMMA plus 683 squared ,COMMA plus 57000 times 683 times two .PERIOD <BREAK>
While I explain something else -- -- I know ,COMMA that you can use ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
That seems right ,COMMA I'll go on .PERIOD Cookie fission ,COMMA OK .PERIOD <BREAK>
A third time ,COMMA it's just being a technician .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA I'm not going to talk about that .PERIOD <BREAK>
Get them out of schools ,COMMA and keep them out of schools .PERIOD <BREAK>
Having said that ,COMMA I outlined my talk about five minutes ago .PERIOD <BREAK>
No ,COMMA if you want to know what society's going to be like in 20 years ,COMMA ask a kindergarten teacher .PERIOD <BREAK>
But to me ,COMMA things aren't the future .PERIOD <BREAK>
Right away ,COMMA I hope that all of your eyes glaze over .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is a Klein bottle .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's one sided .PERIOD It's a bottle whose inside is its outside .PERIOD <BREAK>
It has zero volume .PERIOD And it's non-orientable .PERIOD <BREAK>
It has wonderful properties .PERIOD <BREAK>
That was a month of my life .PERIOD <BREAK>
Oh ,COMMA cool .PERIOD I can get to this place over here ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
I take lunch hour .PERIOD <BREAK>
One of the things that I've done for my science students is to tell them ,COMMA Look ,COMMA I'm going to teach you college-level physics .PERIOD <BREAK>
is a constant .PERIOD When the frequency goes up ,COMMA the wavelength comes down .PERIOD Wavelength goes up ,COMMA frequency goes down .PERIOD So ,COMMA if we have a wave here -- over here ,COMMA that's what's interesting -- as the pitch goes up ,COMMA things get closer ,COMMA pitch goes down ,COMMA things stretch out .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA so I know the frequency .PERIOD <BREAK>
Those of you who are physicists ,COMMA I hear you rolling your eyes ,COMMA but bear with me .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's one of these bell-tower buildings .PERIOD <BREAK>
I keep climbing up ,COMMA go back .PERIOD <BREAK>
A dome ,COMMA one of these ten-foot domes .PERIOD <BREAK>
In this light ,COMMA may science and religion endeavor here for the steady evolution of mankind ,COMMA from darkness to light ,COMMA from narrowness to broad-mindedness ,COMMA from prejudice to tolerance .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's time for me to let it go .PERIOD <BREAK>
We want space efficiency .PERIOD <BREAK>
Finally ,COMMA we want multifunctional spaces and housewares -- a sink combined with a toilet ,COMMA a dining table becomes a bed -- same space ,COMMA a little side table stretches out to seat 10 .PERIOD <BREAK>
Guests ?QUESTIONMARK Move the moving wall ,COMMA have some fold-down guest beds .PERIOD <BREAK>
Thank you .PERIOD <BREAK>
Seriously ,COMMA but dangerously fun .PERIOD <BREAK>
And there it is .PERIOD And I think this is a typical picture of what it was like in a courtyard then .PERIOD <BREAK>
So I'm gonna take you through what I think is a remarkable sequence .PERIOD <BREAK>
Any of you who've been to Africa or had a junkyard dog come after you ,COMMA there is a fixed kind of predatory gaze that you know you're in trouble .PERIOD <BREAK>
And this polar bear stands over the husky ,COMMA no claws extended ,COMMA no fangs taking a look .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it's that state that allows these two creatures to explore the possible .PERIOD <BREAK>
They are beginning to do something that neither would have done without the play signals .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it is a marvelous example of how a differential in power can be overridden by a process of nature that's within all of us .PERIOD <BREAK>
John mentioned that I've done some work with murderers ,COMMA and I have .PERIOD <BREAK>
If you're having a bad day ,COMMA try this :COLON jump up and down ,COMMA wiggle around -- you're going to feel better .PERIOD <BREAK>
But it has to be safe exploration .PERIOD <BREAK>
But if you look closely ,COMMA they're kind of like the polar bear and husky :COLON no claws ,COMMA flat fur ,COMMA soft eyes ,COMMA open mouth with no fangs ,COMMA balletic movements ,COMMA curvilinear movements -- all specific to play .PERIOD <BREAK>
We all have an internal narrative that's our own inner story .PERIOD <BREAK>
We don't know a whole lot about what it does for the human brain ,COMMA because funding has not been exactly heavy for research on play .PERIOD <BREAK>
I think that -- that's a few years back -- I think that wave is past ,COMMA and the play wave is cresting ,COMMA because there is some good science .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA the program says that the opposite of play is not work ,COMMA it's depression .PERIOD <BREAK>
Nobody misses that dog I took a picture of on a Carmel beach a couple of weeks ago .PERIOD <BREAK>
You may not know this word ,COMMA but it should be your biological first name and last name .PERIOD <BREAK>
Found that when he looked at a playground out of a window into which he had been confined ,COMMA he felt something different .PERIOD <BREAK>
And looking at his history ,COMMA which is common in the press ,COMMA it seems to me ,COMMA at least -- looking at it from a shrink's point of view -- that a lot of his life was programmed .PERIOD <BREAK>
He had the expectations of his senatorial father and Washington ,COMMA DC .PERIOD <BREAK>
Most of us work with groups ,COMMA and I put this up because the dschool ,COMMA the design school at Stanford ,COMMA thanks to David Kelley and a lot of others who have been visionary about its establishment ,COMMA has allowed a group of us to get together and create a course called From Play to Innovation .PERIOD <BREAK>
So what will follow is a student-made film about just that .PERIOD <BREAK>
But it doesn't have to be that way .PERIOD <BREAK>
Thank You .PERIOD <BREAK>
If you stop a cat from playing -- which you can do ,COMMA and we've all seen how cats bat around stuff -- they're just as good predators as they would be if they hadn't played .PERIOD <BREAK>
And if you look at sleep and dreams biologically ,COMMA animals sleep and dream ,COMMA and they rehearse and they do some other things that help memory and that are a very important part of sleep and dreams .PERIOD <BREAK>
The next step of evolution in mammals and creatures with divinely superfluous neurons will be to play .PERIOD <BREAK>
Well ,COMMA I think the only way I know to do it is to have accumulated the advisers that I have who go from practitioners -- who can establish through improvisational play or clowning or whatever -- a state of play .PERIOD <BREAK>
Unfortunately ,COMMA that hasn't been done sufficiently for the National Science Foundation ,COMMA National Institute of Mental Health or anybody else to really look at it in this way seriously .PERIOD <BREAK>
So our diners started to get bored with this idea ,COMMA and we decided to give them the same course twice ,COMMA so here we actually took an element from the maki roll and and took a picture of a dish and then basically served that picture with the dish .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's a glycoprotein called miraculin ,COMMA a naturally occurring thing .PERIOD It still freaks me out every time I eat it ,COMMA but it has a unique ability to mask certain taste receptors on your tongue ,COMMA so that primarily sour taste receptors ,COMMA so normally things that would taste very sour or tart ,COMMA somehow begin to taste very sweet .PERIOD <BREAK>
As long as it's good for you and good for the environment ,COMMA it doesn't matter .PERIOD <BREAK>
Aside from one-person ABC mini-bureaus in Nairobi ,COMMA New Delhi and Mumbai ,COMMA there are no network news bureaus in all of Africa ,COMMA India or South America -- places that are home to more than two billion people .PERIOD <BREAK>
And can we afford not to ?QUESTIONMARK Thank you .PERIOD <BREAK>
At this time ,COMMA there were thousands of individuals ,COMMA we think ,COMMA that were infected with HIV .PERIOD <BREAK>
OK now ,COMMA more importantly ,COMMA had we been there in the ' 40 s and ' 50 s ,COMMA ' 60 s ,COMMA had we seen this disease ,COMMA had we understood exactly what was going on with it ,COMMA how might that have changed and completely transformed the nature of the way this pandemic moved ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Nevertheless ,COMMA we spend the vast majority of our energy focused on this level of the pyramid ,COMMA trying to tackle things that are already completely adapted to human beings ,COMMA that are going to be very very difficult to address -- as we've seen in the case of HIV .PERIOD <BREAK>
So during the last 15 years ,COMMA I've been working to actually study the earlier interface here -- what I've labeled viral chatter ,COMMA which was a term coined by my mentor Don Burke .PERIOD <BREAK>
Narrator :COLON Deep in a remote region of Cameroon ,COMMA two hunters stalk their prey .PERIOD <BREAK>
A group of hunters approach ,COMMA their packs loaded with wild game .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is challenging work to do .PERIOD <BREAK>
But -- when he began to speak they would actually recognize his voice from the radio .PERIOD <BREAK>
So what happened ?QUESTIONMARK So during the 10 years that we've been doing this work ,COMMA we actually surprised ourselves .PERIOD <BREAK>
We made a number of discoveries .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's something we should be following .PERIOD It's not something that we should be surprised by .PERIOD <BREAK>
So it's not just hunters in Central Africa .PERIOD <BREAK>
And somehow the idea that one would want to make art for the iPhone ,COMMA which my friends and I are doing now ,COMMA is still not reflected in our understanding of what computers are for .PERIOD <BREAK>
If you look carefully ,COMMA you can even see a hint of the Apple menu ,COMMA up here in the upper left ,COMMA where the virtual world has literally punched through to the physical .PERIOD <BREAK>
Because this is ,COMMA in some sense ,COMMA the first way ,COMMA that people discover their own potential as actors ,COMMA and discover their own agency .PERIOD <BREAK>
By saying Who is that person in the mirror ?QUESTIONMARK Oh it's actually me .PERIOD <BREAK>
Song is one of our oldest ways of making ourselves heard and understood .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so ,COMMA whereas Dr .PERIOD Oliver Sacks has talked about how perhaps one person in a million actually has true synesthesia ,COMMA where they hear colors or taste shapes ,COMMA and things like this ,COMMA phonaesthesia is something we can all experience to some extent .PERIOD <BREAK>
So the idea is you step into a kind of a magic light .PERIOD <BREAK>
You know ?QUESTIONMARK They don't imagine the person in the booth ,COMMA typing it all .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it's one of the most interesting technical challenges that's very currently active in the computer sciences :COLON being able to have a camera that can understand ,COMMA from a fairly big distance away ,COMMA how these little tiny balls are actually pointing in one way or another to reveal what you're interested in ,COMMA and where your attention is directed .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so I've been beginning ,COMMA with a variety of different projects ,COMMA to understand how people can relate to machines with their eyes .PERIOD <BREAK>
In the first one which I'm going to show you ,COMMA called Eyecode ,COMMA it's a piece of interactive software in which ,COMMA if we read this little circle ,COMMA the trace left by the looking of the previous observer looks at the trace left by the looking of previous observer .PERIOD <BREAK>
But if I come up really close and stare directly at the camera on this laptop then you'll see these nice crisp eyes .PERIOD <BREAK>
And what you're typing are recordings of your eyes as you're looking at other peoples' eyes .PERIOD <BREAK>
And this exists in larger installations where there are thousands and thousands of eyes that people could be staring at ,COMMA as you see who's looking at the people looking at the people looking before them .PERIOD <BREAK>
Checking him out .PERIOD <BREAK>
You say what you're doing in 140 characters or less ,COMMA and people who are interested in you get those updates .PERIOD <BREAK>
It is by sharing these moments as they're happening that lets people feel more connected and in touch ,COMMA despite distance ,COMMA and in real time .PERIOD <BREAK>
One of my favorites is what happened a few months ago when there was a gas shortage in Atlanta .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's happened more and more lately ,COMMA whether it's raising money for homeless people or to dig wells in Africa or for a family in crisis .PERIOD <BREAK>
Evan Williams :COLON Nice .PERIOD Thanks .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I would like to tell you a few personal stories about what I like to call the danger of the single story .PERIOD <BREAK>
My characters also drank a lot of ginger beer because the characters in the British books I read drank ginger beer .PERIOD <BREAK>
I realized that people like me ,COMMA girls with skin the color of chocolate ,COMMA whose kinky hair could not form ponytails ,COMMA could also exist in literature .PERIOD <BREAK>
But the unintended consequence was that I did not know that people like me could exist in literature .PERIOD <BREAK>
So what the discovery of African writers did for me was this :COLON It saved me from having a single story of what books are .PERIOD <BREAK>
So I felt enormous pity for Fide's family .PERIOD <BREAK>
If I had not grown up in Nigeria ,COMMA and if all I knew about Africa were from popular images ,COMMA I too would think that Africa was a place of beautiful landscapes ,COMMA beautiful animals ,COMMA and incomprehensible people ,COMMA fighting senseless wars ,COMMA dying of poverty and AIDS ,COMMA unable to speak for themselves and waiting to be saved by a kind ,COMMA white foreigner .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA I've laughed every time I've read this .PERIOD <BREAK>
So that is how to create a single story ,COMMA show a people as one thing ,COMMA as only one thing ,COMMA over and over again ,COMMA and that is what they become .PERIOD <BREAK>
My cousin Polle died because he could not get adequate healthcare .PERIOD <BREAK>
What the Nigerian writer Chinua Achebe calls a balance of stories .PERIOD <BREAK>
What if my roommate knew about my Nigerian publisher ,COMMA Mukta Bakaray ,COMMA a remarkable man who left his job in a bank to follow his dream and start a publishing house ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
He disagreed .PERIOD He felt that people who could read ,COMMA would read ,COMMA if you made literature affordable and available to them .PERIOD <BREAK>
What if my roommate knew about the female lawyer who recently went to court in Nigeria to challenge a ridiculous law that required women to get their husband's consent before renewing their passports ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Stories matter .PERIOD <BREAK>
We face momentous decisions with important consequences throughout our lives ,COMMA and we have strategies for dealing with these decisions .PERIOD <BREAK>
We've surrendered our power ,COMMA trading off our discomfort with uncertainty for the illusion of certainty that they provide .PERIOD <BREAK>
It literally flat-lined .PERIOD <BREAK>
But what my research has shown me is that experts tend on the whole to form very rigid camps ,COMMA that within these camps ,COMMA a dominant perspective emerges that often silences opposition ,COMMA that experts move with the prevailing winds ,COMMA often hero-worshipping their own gurus .PERIOD <BREAK>
A recent study in the Archives of Surgery reported surgeons removing healthy ovaries ,COMMA operating on the wrong side of the brain ,COMMA carrying out procedures on the wrong hand ,COMMA elbow ,COMMA eye ,COMMA foot ,COMMA and also mistakes born out of thinking errors .PERIOD <BREAK>
Why was it that ,COMMA when I had an operation ,COMMA my doctor said to me ,COMMA Beware ,COMMA Ms .PERIOD Hertz ,COMMA of hyperpyrexia ,COMMA when he could have just as easily said ,COMMA Watch out for a high fever .PERIOD <BREAK>
You see ,COMMA being ready to take experts on is about also being willing to dig behind their graphs ,COMMA their equations ,COMMA their forecasts ,COMMA their prophecies ,COMMA and being armed with the questions to do that -- questions like :COLON What are the assumptions that underpin this ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
If we are to shift paradigms ,COMMA if we are to make breakthroughs ,COMMA if we are to destroy myths ,COMMA we need to create an environment in which expert ideas are battling it out ,COMMA in which we're bringing in new ,COMMA diverse ,COMMA discordant ,COMMA heretical views into the discussion ,COMMA fearlessly ,COMMA in the knowledge that progress comes about ,COMMA not only from the creation of ideas ,COMMA but also from their destruction -- and also from the knowledge that ,COMMA by surrounding ourselves by divergent ,COMMA discordant ,COMMA heretical views .PERIOD <BREAK>
Google CEO Eric Schmidt is a practical practitioner of this philosophy .PERIOD <BREAK>
But just imagine if we were to junk this notion of expertise as some sort of elite cadre and instead embrace the notion of democratized expertise -- whereby expertise was not just the preserve of surgeons and CEO's ,COMMA but also shop-girls -- yeah .PERIOD <BREAK>
Thank you .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so the thought that I started with was how do you do this ,COMMA still within the boundary of the science we know today -- no time for science fair ,COMMA no time for playing around with things or waiting for the magic battery to show up .PERIOD <BREAK>
First component is you charge the car whenever you stop -- ends up that cars are these strange beasts that drive for about two hours and park for about 22 hours .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now that last mile ,COMMA last foot ,COMMA in a sense ,COMMA is the first step of the infrastructure .PERIOD <BREAK>
What we found out ,COMMA when you move from molecules to electrons ,COMMA something interesting happens .PERIOD <BREAK>
We have a battery bay .PERIOD It costs the same hundred dollars as the gas tank .PERIOD <BREAK>
Those of you who have a hard time calculating what that means -- in the average consumer environment we're in in the US .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's a new economic factor ,COMMA which is fascinating to most people .PERIOD <BREAK>
So we went out ,COMMA and we looked at all the car companies .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I had to quit and come and do this thing called A Better Place .PERIOD <BREAK>
We decided to come into the US .PERIOD <BREAK>
The foundation of this curve is that we keep losing the wells that are close to the ground .PERIOD <BREAK>
By 2015 we would have had at least 250 million new cars even at the pace we're going at right now .PERIOD <BREAK>
And then we do the OPEC stimulus package also known as 200 dollars a barrel .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that's the difference between problems that are additive ,COMMA like CO 2 ,COMMA which we go slowly up and then we tip ,COMMA and problems that are depletive ,COMMA in which we lose what we have ,COMMA which oscillate ,COMMA and they oscillate until we lose everything we've got .PERIOD <BREAK>
You have to remember that the world today is bringing in so many cars .PERIOD <BREAK>
You're looking at a world where cars are matched with windmills .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's one percent a year .PERIOD <BREAK>
And when we go to COP 15 at the end of this year we can't stop thinking of padding CO 2 .PERIOD <BREAK>
We have to start thinking about giving kickers to countries that are willing to go to this kind of scale .PERIOD <BREAK>
And there will be about a 20 percent chance we'll recover him .PERIOD <BREAK>
We have to make it immediately .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we need to do it not within 20 years or 50 years ,COMMA but within this presidential term because if we don't ,COMMA we will lose our economy ,COMMA right after we'd lost our morality .PERIOD <BREAK>
They see us as rocking the boat ,COMMA and you can understand why .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA it may sound as though I'm about to preach atheism ,COMMA and I want to reassure you that that's not what I'm going to do .PERIOD <BREAK>
Essentially ,COMMA it does it by providing a smooth ramp of gradual step-by-step increment .PERIOD <BREAK>
It turns out to be ,COMMA in principle ,COMMA incapable of doing the job required of it .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA we're used to not challenging religious ideas and it's very interesting how much of a furor Richard creates when he does it .PERIOD He meant me ,COMMA not that one .PERIOD <BREAK>
It teaches them to accept authority ,COMMA revelation and faith instead of always insisting on evidence .PERIOD <BREAK>
But suppose -- -- in 1987 ,COMMA a reporter asked George Bush ,COMMA Sr .PERIOD <BREAK>
whether he recognized the equal citizenship and patriotism of Americans who are atheists .PERIOD <BREAK>
She clearly feels in a beleaguered minority ,COMMA but actually ,COMMA how do American atheists stack up numerically ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
The survey that I quoted ,COMMA which is the ARIS survey ,COMMA didn't break down its data by socio-economic class or education ,COMMA IQ or anything else .PERIOD <BREAK>
But let me know show you some data that have been properly published and analyzed on one special group ,COMMA namely ,COMMA top scientists .PERIOD <BREAK>
In 1998 ,COMMA Larson and Witham polled the cream of American scientists ,COMMA those who'd been honored by election to the National Academy of Sciences ,COMMA and among this select group ,COMMA belief in a personal God dropped to a shattering seven percent .PERIOD <BREAK>
Similar figures obtained for belief in personal immortality .PERIOD <BREAK>
I've not seen corresponding figures for elite scholars in other fields ,COMMA such history or philosophy ,COMMA but I'd be surprised if they were different .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I've already hinted what that something is .PERIOD <BREAK>
From what I've seen of TED ,COMMA I think this may be the ideal place to launch it .PERIOD <BREAK>
Again ,COMMA I fear it will cost money .PERIOD <BREAK>
I suspect that the word atheist itself contains or remains a stumbling block far out of proportion to what it actually means ,COMMA and a stumbling block to people who otherwise might be happy to out themselves .PERIOD <BREAK>
Hence the phrase ,COMMA tooth fairy agnostic .PERIOD <BREAK>
The onus is not on the rest of us to say why not .PERIOD <BREAK>
But we don't bother to say so ,COMMA and this is why my friend uses tooth fairy agnostic as a label for what most people would call atheist .PERIOD <BREAK>
When atheists like Stephen Hawking and Albert Einstein use the word God ,COMMA they use it of course as a metaphorical shorthand for that deep ,COMMA mysterious part of physics which we don't yet understand .PERIOD <BREAK>
What I want to do this morning is share with you a couple of stories and talk about a different Africa .PERIOD <BREAK>
Already this morning there were some allusions to the Africa that you hear about all the time :COLON the Africa of HIV/AIDS ,COMMA the Africa of malaria ,COMMA the Africa of poverty ,COMMA the Africa of conflict ,COMMA and the Africa of disasters .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is a story about the fact that people want their resources managed properly for their good ,COMMA and not taken out to places where they'll benefit just a few of the elite .PERIOD <BREAK>
Because if we can get the 20 billion dollars sitting out there back ,COMMA it may be far more for some of these countries than all the aid that is being put together .PERIOD <BREAK>
One in four sub-Saharan Africans is Nigerian ,COMMA and it has 140 million dynamic people -- chaotic people -- but very interesting people .PERIOD You'll never be bored .PERIOD <BREAK>
Not the International Monetary Fund .PERIOD Not the World Bank ,COMMA where I worked for 21 years and rose to be a vice president .PERIOD <BREAK>
You couldn't get it .PERIOD You had to bribe .PERIOD <BREAK>
The smartest one ,COMMA first to come in ,COMMA was the MTN company of South Africa .PERIOD <BREAK>
Nigerians themselves began to develop some wireless telecommunications companies ,COMMA and three or four others have come in .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we had GDP grow from an average of 23 percent the previous decade to about 65 percent now .PERIOD <BREAK>
We consolidated them from 89 to 25 banks by requiring that they increase their capital -- share capital .PERIOD <BREAK>
In tourism ,COMMA in many African countries ,COMMA a great opportunity .PERIOD <BREAK>
But you should know that this continent is not -- is a continent of many countries ,COMMA not one country .PERIOD <BREAK>
But imagine the impact on a family :COLON if the parents can be employed and make sure that their children go to school ,COMMA that they can buy the drugs to fight the disease themselves .PERIOD <BREAK>
If we can invest in places where you yourselves make money whilst creating jobs and helping people stand on their own feet ,COMMA isn't that a wonderful opportunity ?QUESTIONMARK Isn't that the way to go ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Mixing African materials ,COMMA such as we have ,COMMA with materials from elsewhere .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so ,COMMA to start helping that ,COMMA I want to take us back to 1835 .PERIOD <BREAK>
Four and a half million users around the world ,COMMA contributing their leftover computer cycles ,COMMA whenever their computer isn't working ,COMMA by running a screen saver ,COMMA and together sharing their resources to create a massive supercomputer that NASA harnesses to analyze the data coming from radio telescopes .PERIOD <BREAK>
What this picture suggests to us is that we've got a radical change in the way information production and exchange is capitalized .PERIOD Not that it's become less capital intensive -- that there's less money that's required -- but that the ownership of this capital ,COMMA the way the capitalization happens ,COMMA is radically distributed .PERIOD Each of us ,COMMA in these advanced economies ,COMMA has one of these ,COMMA or something rather like it -- a computer .PERIOD <BREAK>
It used to be wireless was one person owned the license ,COMMA they transmitted in an area ,COMMA and it had to be decided whether they would be licensed or based on property .PERIOD <BREAK>
It was too expensive to have decentralized social production ,COMMA to have decentralized action in society .PERIOD That was not about society itself .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's that it's the first time that it's having major economic impact .PERIOD <BREAK>
You have to hire them to spend a lot of time .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's creating ,COMMA and it's most visible when we see it as a new form of competition .PERIOD <BREAK>
Peer-to-peer networks assaulting the recording industry ;SEMICOLON free and open source software taking market share from Microsoft ;SEMICOLON Skype potentially threatening traditional telecoms ;SEMICOLON Wikipedia competing with online encyclopedias .PERIOD <BREAK>
And you see surfers ,COMMA people who see this happening ,COMMA and in some sense build it into a supply chain ,COMMA which is a very curious one .PERIOD Right ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
In 1918 ,COMMA a new virus appeared that killed some 50 to 100 million people .PERIOD <BREAK>
It spread like wildfire and some died within hours of developing symptoms .PERIOD <BREAK>
When they work ,COMMA they can make history ,COMMA but after a while you can barely hear them .PERIOD <BREAK>
Or polio ?QUESTIONMARK How many of you remember the iron lung ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
So let's explore how vaccines work .PERIOD <BREAK>
When you're pre-immunized ,COMMA what happens is you have forces in your body pre-trained to recognize and defeat specific foes .PERIOD <BREAK>
Seth Berkley :COLON Really cool video ,COMMA isn't it ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
In addition ,COMMA wild aquatic birds carry all known strains of influenza .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now luckily ,COMMA that particular virus ,COMMA although very scary at the time ,COMMA did not transmit from person to person very easily .PERIOD <BREAK>
We've got these new antibodies we've identified ,COMMA and we know that they latch onto many ,COMMA many variations of the virus .PERIOD <BREAK>
But ,COMMA you know ,COMMA the research that has occurred from HIV now has really helped with innovation with other diseases .PERIOD <BREAK>
So far ,COMMA animal tests indicate that such a vaccine could prevent severe disease ,COMMA although you might get a mild case .PERIOD <BREAK>
It was a slow ,COMMA cumbersome process that depended on chicken eggs ,COMMA millions of living chicken eggs .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now think of where this leads us .PERIOD <BREAK>
New infectious diseases appear or reappear every few years .PERIOD <BREAK>
Will we be quick enough to react before millions die ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
You also can use adjuvants ,COMMA which are chemicals you mix .PERIOD <BREAK>
I call them the Cheetah Generation .PERIOD <BREAK>
The Cheetah Generation is a new breed of Africans who brook no nonsense about corruption .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA we're talking about a continent that is not poor .PERIOD <BREAK>
There are people who think that we should pour more money ,COMMA more aid into this bowl which leaks .PERIOD <BREAK>
Let's take food imports .PERIOD <BREAK>
Just add that up ,COMMA all these leakages .PERIOD <BREAK>
Kwame Nkrumah ,COMMA Nyerere ,COMMA Kenyatta -- somebody mentioned Idi Amin .PERIOD <BREAK>
By creating wealth ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And you can't develop the informal and the traditional sectors without an operational understanding of how these two sectors work .PERIOD <BREAK>
Without the council the chief can't pass any law ,COMMA and if the chief doesn't govern according to the will of the people he will be removed .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA it's quite appropriate that this section is called a marketplace .PERIOD <BREAK>
What Africans practiced was a different form of capitalism ,COMMA but then after independence ,COMMA all of a sudden ,COMMA markets ,COMMA capitalism became a western institution ,COMMA and the leaders said Africans were ready for socialism .PERIOD <BREAK>
A bigger boat will mean more fish will be caught and landed .PERIOD <BREAK>
They're people getting out of poverty as fast as they can .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the journalist was asking him ,COMMA Why is this so important ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
They disappeared .PERIOD <BREAK>
But a couple of weeks ago ,COMMA I asked a bunch of friends to Google Egypt and to send me screen shots of what they got .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the thing is that the algorithms don't yet have the kind of embedded ethics that the editors did .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now I have to take off my shoes or boots to get on an airplane !EXCLAMATIONMARK <BREAK>
We went in and sat down at the booth ,COMMA and the waitress came over ,COMMA made a big commotion over Tipper .PERIOD <BREAK>
She said Yes ,COMMA that's former Vice President Al Gore and his wife Tipper .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's like beachcombing ,COMMA you know ?QUESTIONMARK Every time the tide comes in and out ,COMMA you find some more shells .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's an easy ,COMMA visible target of concern ,COMMA and it should be ,COMMA but there is more global warming pollution that comes from buildings than from cars and trucks .PERIOD <BREAK>
Insulation ,COMMA better design ,COMMA buy green electricity where you can .PERIOD <BREAK>
A lot of us in here have made that decision and it is really pretty easy .PERIOD <BREAK>
It doesn't mean that if you are a Republican that I'm trying to convince you to be a Democrat .PERIOD We need Republicans as well .PERIOD This used to be a bipartisan issue ,COMMA and I know that in this group it really is .PERIOD Become politically active .PERIOD <BREAK>
We have to buy a lot of those ads .PERIOD <BREAK>
Again ,COMMA the Republicans here ,COMMA this shouldn't be partisan .PERIOD <BREAK>
And all the burning of oil and coal and gas ,COMMA all the fossil fuels ,COMMA have changed the atmosphere greatly .PERIOD <BREAK>
And one of the really most incredible things ,COMMA I think ,COMMA is that there's nobody out there trying to collect it at the site where it is densest .PERIOD <BREAK>
You see people who are really shell-shocked .PERIOD <BREAK>
So this is the Gulf of Mexico ,COMMA sparkling place full of fish .PERIOD <BREAK>
You can see where the oil is concentrated at the surface ,COMMA and then it is attacked ,COMMA because they don't want the evidence ,COMMA in my opinion .PERIOD <BREAK>
We heard that bacteria eat oil ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
So do sea turtles .PERIOD <BREAK>
When it breaks up ,COMMA it has a long way to go before it gets down to bacteria .PERIOD <BREAK>
I heard the most incredible story today when I was on the train coming here .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's the story of thousands of people .PERIOD <BREAK>
The other thing about the Gulf that is important is that there are a lot of animals that concentrate in the Gulf at certain parts of the year .PERIOD <BREAK>
If it's not ,COMMA it's certainly affecting their eggs and larvae ,COMMA I would certainly think .PERIOD <BREAK>
So while the oil spill ,COMMA the leak ,COMMA the eruption ,COMMA is a catastrophe ,COMMA I think it's important to keep in mind that we've done a lot to affect what's in the ocean for a very ,COMMA very long time .PERIOD <BREAK>
We're starting with something that's had a lot of stresses and a lot of problems to begin with .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's just ridiculous .PERIOD <BREAK>
I think that this is the result of gross negligence .PERIOD <BREAK>
The first offshore drills were called harpoons .PERIOD <BREAK>
Your sequence and mine are slightly different .PERIOD <BREAK>
I've got brown eyes ;SEMICOLON you might have blue or gray .PERIOD <BREAK>
I think we should say it all together .PERIOD <BREAK>
And still ,COMMA you may not see the branches .PERIOD <BREAK>
But seriously ,COMMA what's wrong with this ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
You already know enough to tell me -- what's wrong with this statement ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And so let's do a series of comparisons to show you .PERIOD <BREAK>
I assure you ,COMMA this is very tiny .PERIOD It's just six microns on a side .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that's just a mouse brain -- it's a lot smaller than a human brain .PERIOD <BREAK>
I feel curiosity ,COMMA and I feel wonder ,COMMA but at times I have also felt despair .PERIOD <BREAK>
Why did I choose to study this organ that is so awesome in its complexity that it might well be infinite ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And there's a lot of evidence that neural activity is encoding our thoughts ,COMMA feelings and perceptions ,COMMA our mental experiences .PERIOD <BREAK>
And if you put those two facts together ,COMMA it means that your experiences can change your connectome .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it might true that just the mere act of thinking can change your connectome -- an idea that you may find empowering .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so we might even speak of the stream of consciousness .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'll give you a hint .PERIOD It's a big number .PERIOD <BREAK>
Zach Kaplan :COLON Keith and I lead a research team .PERIOD <BREAK>
Because the way that he presented the concept -- his approach was totally different than ours .PERIOD He sold it to you as if it was for sale right now .PERIOD <BREAK>
Inventables Water Adventures dares you to launch yourself on a magnetically-levitating board down a waterslide so fast ,COMMA so tall ,COMMA that when you hit the bottom ,COMMA it uses brakes to stop .PERIOD <BREAK>
In addition ,COMMA you can see from the diagram on the right ,COMMA the underpart of the slide would be an electromagnet .PERIOD <BREAK>
So I'm sure all you engineers know that even though aluminum is a metal ,COMMA it's not a magnetic material .PERIOD But something unexpected happens when you drop a magnet down an aluminum tube .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's perfectly clear ,COMMA it's odorless ,COMMA it's colorless .PERIOD <BREAK>
Shape-retaining is common in metal :COLON you bend a piece of aluminum foil ,COMMA and it holds its place .PERIOD Contrast that with a plastic garbage can -- and you can push in the sides and it always bounces back .PERIOD <BREAK>
So my favorite idea for this is to apply the ink to a book .PERIOD <BREAK>
For our last technology ,COMMA we worked again with Roman and his team at the Directors Bureau to develop a commercial from the future to explain how it works .PERIOD <BREAK>
And these dyes change color in response to odors .PERIOD <BREAK>
By detecting the odor of particular bacteria ,COMMA or viruses ,COMMA or even lung cancer ,COMMA the dots will change and they can use software to analyze the results .PERIOD <BREAK>
Because every one of these six changed our understanding of what was possible in the world .PERIOD Prior to seeing this ,COMMA we would have assumed :COLON a 10 -foot pole couldn't fit in your pocket ;SEMICOLON something as inexpensive as ink couldn't sense the way paper is being bent ;SEMICOLON every one of these things -- and we're constantly trying to find more .PERIOD <BREAK>
Thank you .PERIOD <BREAK>
I mean ,COMMA it's crucified .PERIOD <BREAK>
Spanish chef accused of cheating .PERIOD <BREAK>
A huge scandal for a few weeks .PERIOD <BREAK>
That is ,COMMA until I went to Eduardo's farm in Extremadura ,COMMA 50 miles north of Seville ,COMMA right on the Portugal border .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'm just here to give the geese what they want .PERIOD <BREAK>
I was speaking too loudly .PERIOD <BREAK>
Right up to us ,COMMA like right up to here .PERIOD <BREAK>
He doesn't .PERIOD <BREAK>

Part of the income for his farm .PERIOD <BREAK>
A big part of his income for his farm .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's how I've been trained .PERIOD <BREAK>
So I'm listening to all this ,COMMA you know ,COMMA and I'm like ,COMMA is this guy for real ?QUESTIONMARK Is he making some of this up ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Is he like ,COMMA you know -- because he seemed to have an answer for everything ,COMMA and it was always nature .PERIOD <BREAK>
Because ,COMMA really ,COMMA they want you to look at themselves ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And we're sitting there ,COMMA and I hear [clapping] from a distance ,COMMA so I look over .PERIOD <BREAK>
To fly south in the winter and north when it gets warm ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And the problem with saying that ,COMMA of course ,COMMA is that you know ,COMMA at this point it risks hyperbole really easily .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'm really in love with him at this point .PERIOD <BREAK>
He takes the liver when he harvests the foie gras ,COMMA he sticks them in this jar and he confits it .PERIOD <BREAK>
No salt ,COMMA no pepper ,COMMA no oil ,COMMA no spices .PERIOD <BREAK>
We went back out for the final tour of the farm ,COMMA and he showed me the wild pepper plants and the plants that he made sure existed on his farm for salinity .PERIOD <BREAK>
How come you don't give him this ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
I really was moved .PERIOD <BREAK>
The Pharaoh got wind of this and wanted to taste it .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the Jews ,COMMA fearing for their life ,COMMA had to come up with an ingenious idea ,COMMA or at least try and satisfy the Pharaoh's wishes ,COMMA of course .PERIOD <BREAK>
One in which we stop treating the planet as if it were some kind of business in liquidation .PERIOD <BREAK>
Whether we're talking about Brussels sprouts or foie gras .PERIOD <BREAK>
That is our poetry .PERIOD That is our beautiful story .PERIOD <BREAK>
OK ,COMMA I can see ,COMMA if I found something ,COMMA up ,COMMA up ,COMMA and they continue ,COMMA up up up .PERIOD <BREAK>
You ,COMMA you survive .PERIOD It's OK .PERIOD <BREAK>
Nobody's obliged to be a genius .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's better ,COMMA but nobody .PERIOD <BREAK>
This line of evolution is clearly positive .PERIOD <BREAK>
But if you take a lens ,COMMA like that ,COMMA this line is ack ,COMMA ack ,COMMA ack ,COMMA ack ,COMMA ack .PERIOD Like that .PERIOD <BREAK>
There is different type of barbaria .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's why today I'm so ashamed to make this job .PERIOD <BREAK>
But I know that even I do it the best possible -- that's why I'm the best -- it's nothing .PERIOD <BREAK>
And because we must all work to finish this story .PERIOD <BREAK>
This scenario ,COMMA of this civilization ,COMMA was about becoming powerful ,COMMA intelligent ,COMMA like this idea we have invented ,COMMA this concept of God .PERIOD <BREAK>
You go to the future back ,COMMA back ,COMMA back ,COMMA back ,COMMA like that .PERIOD <BREAK>
He would also supply me with tools .PERIOD <BREAK>
It was this great magic store .PERIOD It was a crappy little building in Midtown ,COMMA but you'd be in the elevator ,COMMA the elevator would open -- there'd be this little ,COMMA small magic store .PERIOD You'd be in the magic store .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so I started thinking about Lost ,COMMA and the stuff that we do ,COMMA and I realized ,COMMA oh my God ,COMMA mystery boxes are everywhere in what I do !EXCLAMATIONMARK <BREAK>
Jack :COLON Get him out of here !EXCLAMATIONMARK Get him away from the engine !EXCLAMATIONMARK Get him out of here !EXCLAMATIONMARK <BREAK>
Man :COLON Hey !EXCLAMATIONMARK Hey !EXCLAMATIONMARK Hey ,COMMA get away from -- JJA :COLON Now ,COMMA 10 years ago ,COMMA if we wanted to do that ,COMMA we'd have to kill a stuntman .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I often am like ,COMMA you know ,COMMA dude ,COMMA today I'm out .PERIOD I got nothing .PERIOD You know ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
So there's that .PERIOD In terms of the content of it ,COMMA you look at stories ,COMMA you think ,COMMA well ,COMMA what are stories but mystery boxes ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Then there's the thing of mystery in terms of imagination -- the withholding of information .PERIOD You know ,COMMA doing that intentionally is much more engaging .PERIOD <BREAK>
Die Hard ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK Crazy ,COMMA great ,COMMA fun ,COMMA action-adventure movie in a building .PERIOD <BREAK>
There are great scenes -- maybe not the most amazing dramatic scenes in the history of time ,COMMA but pretty great scenes .PERIOD <BREAK>
Father :COLON 'Cause I need it .PERIOD <BREAK>
Come on !EXCLAMATIONMARK So you think of Jaws -- so that's the kind of stuff that ,COMMA like ,COMMA you know ,COMMA the investment of character ,COMMA which is the stuff that really is inside the box ,COMMA you know ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
It's why when people do sequels ,COMMA or rip off movies ,COMMA you know ,COMMA of a genre ,COMMA they're ripping off the wrong thing .PERIOD <BREAK>
You gotta rip off -- you know ,COMMA if you rip something off -- rip off the character .PERIOD <BREAK>
Because ultimately ,COMMA you know ,COMMA the mystery box is all of us .PERIOD So there's that .PERIOD <BREAK>
The moment the lights go down is often the best part ,COMMA you know ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And you're full of that amazing -- that feeling of excited anticipation .PERIOD <BREAK>
The stuff that I was lucky and begging for to get when I was a kid is now ubiquitous .PERIOD <BREAK>
When I did Mission :COLON Impossible III ,COMMA we had amazing visual effects stuff .PERIOD <BREAK>
So Eddie has this gun -- and he's the greatest guy -- he's this really sweet English guy .PERIOD He's like ,COMMA Sorry ,COMMA I don't want to hurt you .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I realized that we had to do something 'cause it wasn't working just as it was .PERIOD <BREAK>
And Tom would know just how hard to push the gun .PERIOD He wouldn't hurt himself .PERIOD <BREAK>
And in the Egyptian revolution ,COMMA the Revolution 20 ,COMMA everyone has contributed something ,COMMA small or big .PERIOD They contributed something -- to bring us one of the most inspiring stories in the history of mankind when it comes to revolutions .PERIOD <BREAK>
It was actually really inspiring to see all these Egyptians completely changing .PERIOD <BREAK>
But the reason why everyone was silent is what I call the psychological barrier of fear .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that psychological barrier of fear had worked for so many years ,COMMA and here comes the Internet ,COMMA technology ,COMMA BlackBerry ,COMMA SMS .PERIOD <BREAK>
Platforms like YouTube ,COMMA Twitter ,COMMA Facebook were helping us a lot because it basically gave us the impression that ,COMMA Wow ,COMMA I'm not alone .PERIOD <BREAK>
They probably have the best life in the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
And everyone started to think that this guy could be my brother .PERIOD <BREAK>
What are we going to do ?QUESTIONMARK I don't know .PERIOD <BREAK>
In a few days ,COMMA tens of thousands of people there -- angry Egyptians who were asking the ministry of interior affairs ,COMMA Enough .PERIOD <BREAK>
But of course ,COMMA they don't listen .PERIOD <BREAK>
In fact ,COMMA one of the most ridiculous ideas was ,COMMA Hey ,COMMA let's have a silent stand .PERIOD <BREAK>
There was no leader .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I'm not going to talk about my experience ,COMMA because this is not about me .PERIOD <BREAK>
The next day I was in Tahrir .PERIOD <BREAK>
When I saw that ,COMMA I went back and I wrote on Facebook .PERIOD <BREAK>
But today I'm going to talk to you about something you can't see -- what's going on up in that little brain of hers .PERIOD <BREAK>
And therein lies a critical puzzle .PERIOD <BREAK>
Well ,COMMA it's got to do with your brain .PERIOD <BREAK>
But we as adults are no longer absorbing those statistics .PERIOD <BREAK>
It takes a human being for babies to take their statistics .PERIOD <BREAK>
So this is little Emma .PERIOD <BREAK>
Just as the poets and writers described ,COMMA we're going to be able to see ,COMMA I think ,COMMA that wondrous openness ,COMMA utter and complete openness ,COMMA of the mind of a child .PERIOD <BREAK>
Thank you .PERIOD <BREAK>
And early in the morning ,COMMA I went into the ward .PERIOD <BREAK>
I watched her hands as she bathed an old man .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we run clinics in these very remote regions where there's no medical care whatsoever .PERIOD <BREAK>
And he walked in ,COMMA and somebody said something to him ,COMMA we realized he was deaf ,COMMA and we looked into the rags ,COMMA and there was this pair of eyes .PERIOD <BREAK>
The rags were unwrapped from a little girl whose body was massively burned .PERIOD <BREAK>
It was the young women ,COMMA the health aids ,COMMA who cleaned the wounds of this baby and dressed the wounds .PERIOD <BREAK>
And my family brought in a woman whose mother had been a slave to take care of me .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that woman did not have sentimental compassion .PERIOD <BREAK>
I had that condition ,COMMA to a certain extent ,COMMA from my own childhood illness .PERIOD <BREAK>
And in that paralysis ,COMMA of course ,COMMA our capacity for compassion is also paralyzed .PERIOD <BREAK>
The very word terror is global .PERIOD <BREAK>
So our work ,COMMA in a certain way ,COMMA is to address this imago ,COMMA this kind of archetype that has pervaded the psyche of our entire globe .PERIOD <BREAK>
Hey ,COMMA we live in a very noxious world .PERIOD <BREAK>
Why don't we train our children in compassion ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Women have manifested for thousands of years the strength arising from compassion in an unfiltered ,COMMA unmediated way in perceiving suffering as it is .PERIOD <BREAK>
And they have actualized compassion through direct action .PERIOD <BREAK>
He sees that the dog has this big wound on its leg .PERIOD <BREAK>
I was one of the founding members of the Axis of Evil Comedy Tour .PERIOD <BREAK>
Then there was Aron Kader ,COMMA who was the Palestinian-American .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I opened it up ,COMMA it said ,COMMA Born in Iran .PERIOD I'm like ,COMMA Oh ,COMMA come on ,COMMA man .PERIOD <BREAK>
Ah ha !EXCLAMATIONMARK American ,COMMA great .PERIOD <BREAK>
His name was Jabbar .PERIOD <BREAK>
He says ,COMMA You wait .PERIOD I'll be back ,COMMA and he walked away .PERIOD <BREAK>
Like a couple months ago in Times Square in New York ,COMMA there was this Pakistani Muslim guy who tried to blow up a car bomb .PERIOD <BREAK>
And one thing that happened there was also the Pakistani Taliban took credit for that failed car bombing .PERIOD <BREAK>
We just wanted to say we tried .PERIOD <BREAK>
Out of my way .PERIOD Out of my way .PERIOD Out of my way .PERIOD <BREAK>
You want some frozen yogurt ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
I have one gram ,COMMA five gram ,COMMA 10 gram .PERIOD How many gram do you want ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
I put my two year-old on the slide ;SEMICOLON he went frrmrmm !EXCLAMATIONMARK He took off .PERIOD <BREAK>
I went down .PERIOD I go ,COMMA Where's my son ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
I go ,COMMA I'm sorry .PERIOD Then why were you staring at me ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
So I would like to show you something I've been working on .PERIOD <BREAK>
He had this wonderful trick where a rosebush would bloom right in front of your eyes .PERIOD <BREAK>
But it was his production of a butterfly that was the most beautiful .PERIOD <BREAK>
Marco Tempest :COLON When asked about deception ,COMMA he said this :COLON Announcer :COLON Magic is the only honest profession .PERIOD <BREAK>
I use a lot of tricks ,COMMA which means that sometimes I have to lie to you .PERIOD <BREAK>
Girl in Phone :COLON Hey ,COMMA where are you ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Lady :COLON I'll be ready in just a minute ,COMMA darling .PERIOD <BREAK>
Self-deception .PERIOD <BREAK>
Which is why in this vast and lonely cosmos ,COMMA we are so wonderfully optimistic .PERIOD <BREAK>
Put a crab inside it .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA the guy replies ,COMMA Yeah ,COMMA I know ,COMMA I know .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'm like a junior varsity cheerleader sometimes -- for swearing ,COMMA awkward silences ,COMMA and very simple rhyme schemes .PERIOD <BREAK>
[ i don't need 2 write it down .PERIOD ] I'm going to show you how terrorism actually interacts with our daily life .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA as many of you may remember ,COMMA the Red Brigades was a terrorist ,COMMA Marxist organization which was very active in Italy from the 1960 s until the mid- 1980 s .PERIOD <BREAK>
As part of their strategy the Red Brigades never spoke with anybody ,COMMA not even with their lawyers .PERIOD <BREAK>
In 1993 they declared the end of the armed struggle .PERIOD <BREAK>
But this is exactly what I did because I wanted to know what had turned my best friend into a terrorist ,COMMA and why she'd never tried to recruit me .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA because I am a trained economist and I think in economic terms ,COMMA all of the sudden I thought ,COMMA maybe there is something here .PERIOD <BREAK>
And there are three main stages .PERIOD <BREAK>
But above all ,COMMA they started to do serious business with the world of crime .PERIOD <BREAK>
Rogue economics is a force which is constantly lurking in the background of history .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it actually happened again ,COMMA with the fall of the Berlin wall .PERIOD <BREAK>
What does it mean ?QUESTIONMARK That means that it has a privilege that other countries do not have .PERIOD <BREAK>
This privilege is called seigniorage .PERIOD <BREAK>
No other country can do that .PERIOD <BREAK>
What the Patriot Act did was to prohibit US .PERIOD bank ,COMMA and US-registered foreign banks from doing any businesses with off-shore facilities .PERIOD <BREAK>
It also gave the US .PERIOD monetary authorities the right to monitor any dollar transaction taking place anywhere in the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
It was introduced only in the United States .PERIOD <BREAK>
In Europe ,COMMA a similar legislation was not introduced .PERIOD <BREAK>
Cumulatively ,COMMA I will have rowed over 8000 miles ,COMMA taken over three million oar strokes and spent more than 312 days alone on the ocean on a 23 foot rowboat .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA some of you might be thinking ,COMMA Hold on a minute .PERIOD She doesn't look very much like an ocean rower .PERIOD <BREAK>
I thought there were them and there were us ,COMMA and I was not one of them .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I think I knew from day one that it wasn't the right job for me .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'd gone through some changes .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I remember looking at these two versions of my obituary and thinking ,COMMA Oh boy ,COMMA I'm on totally the wrong track here .PERIOD <BREAK>
It was a bit like finishing a marathon and getting out of solitary confinement and winning an Oscar all rolled into one .PERIOD <BREAK>
Mostly ,COMMA a baseball cap ,COMMA rowing gloves and a smile -- or a frown ,COMMA depending on whether I went backwards overnight -- and lots of sun lotion .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA because nobody in their straight mind would row straight past Hawaii without dropping in ,COMMA I decided to cut this very big undertaking into three segments .PERIOD <BREAK>
But what do you do ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
I had a meeting with the president there ,COMMA who told me about his exit strategy for his country .PERIOD <BREAK>
I even met one of them and she was just about my size .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is a world-wide community .PERIOD <BREAK>
I plan on being around for a long time ,COMMA and when I'm 90 years old ,COMMA I want to be happy and healthy .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's very difficult to be healthy on a planet where we've poisoned the earth and the sea and the air .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the idea here is that all our Eco-Heroes will log at least one green deed every day .PERIOD <BREAK>
And if you put creation and optimism together ,COMMA you've got two choices that you can talk about .PERIOD <BREAK>
This has been a really galvanizing issue for a long time .PERIOD <BREAK>
This was a scheme by a team called THINK ,COMMA a New York-based team ,COMMA and then there was that one ,COMMA which was the Libeskind scheme .PERIOD <BREAK>
We all want to go out and buy an Audi TT ,COMMA don't we ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
It's in our nature to go ricocheting back and forth between this technocratic solution and a larger ,COMMA sort of more romantic image of where we are .PERIOD <BREAK>
And these are two of the top architectural practices in the United States today .PERIOD <BREAK>
Yeah ,COMMA it's one of those giant camera lenses that takes a picture of the outside world -- it's sort of a little movie ,COMMA without any moving parts -- and projects it on a page ,COMMA and you can see the world outside you as you walk around it .PERIOD <BREAK>
They all want to save money by building the same thing 500 times .PERIOD <BREAK>
Here's the little drawing that tells them how that works -- and that's what will happen in the end .PERIOD <BREAK>
So let's make architectural sand dunes and a beach cabana .PERIOD <BREAK>
So they went out and they modeled a computer model of a sand dune .PERIOD <BREAK>
Only one of whom had ever seen the plans before .PERIOD <BREAK>
It has its own built-in swimming pool ,COMMA very ,COMMA very cool .PERIOD <BREAK>
Here it is going across .PERIOD And there ,COMMA down the other side ,COMMA and you get the same kind of grandeur .PERIOD <BREAK>
I want you to know the room you're looking at is stark white .PERIOD <BREAK>
Rosa Mexicano restaurant ,COMMA where he transports us to the shores of Acapulco ,COMMA up on the Upper West Side ,COMMA with this wall of cliff divers who -- there you go ,COMMA like that .PERIOD <BREAK>
Boo Hewerdine ,COMMA Thomas Dolby ,COMMA thank you very much for inviting me .PERIOD It's been a blessing singing for you .PERIOD <BREAK>
Right now is the most exciting time to see new Indian art .PERIOD <BREAK>
This next artist ,COMMA NS .PERIOD Harsha ,COMMA actually has a studio right here in Mysore .PERIOD <BREAK>
He's putting a contemporary spin on the miniature tradition .PERIOD <BREAK>
He creates these fine ,COMMA delicate images which he then repeats on a massive scale .PERIOD <BREAK>
This next artist is probably the alpha male of contemporary Indian art ,COMMA Subodh Gupta .PERIOD <BREAK>
But I can only hope I've whet your appetite to go out and see and learn more about the amazing things that are happening in art in India today .PERIOD <BREAK>
So I'm going to show you some ways that we can violate your expectations .PERIOD First of all ,COMMA I want to show you the particular illusion here .PERIOD I want you first of all when it pops up on the screen to notice that the two holes are perpendicular to each other .PERIOD These are all perceptual tricks .PERIOD These are real objects that I'm going to show you .PERIOD Now I'm going to show you how it is done .PERIOD I've looped the film here so you can get a very interesting experience .PERIOD I want you to see how this illusion is constructed ,COMMA and it's going to rotate so you see that it's inside out .PERIOD Now watch ,COMMA as it rotates back ,COMMA how quickly your perception snaps .PERIOD OK now .PERIOD <BREAK>
How many of you here see dolphins ?QUESTIONMARK Raise your hand if you see dolphins .PERIOD OK ,COMMA those people who raised their hands ,COMMA afterwards ,COMMA the rest of the audience ,COMMA go talk to them ,COMMA all right ?QUESTIONMARK Actually ,COMMA this is the best example of priming by experience that I know .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA something like this can be used because this is after all talk about design ,COMMA too .PERIOD This was done by Saatchi and Saatchi ,COMMA and they actually got away with this ad in Australia .PERIOD So ,COMMA if you look at this ad for beer ,COMMA all those people are in sort of provocative positions .PERIOD But they got it passed ,COMMA and actually won the Clio awards ,COMMA so it's funny how you can do these things .PERIOD <BREAK>
You can violate your expectations about experience .PERIOD Here is an outside water fountain that I created with some friends of mine ,COMMA but you can stop the water in drops and -- actually make all the drops levitate .PERIOD This is something we're building for ,COMMA you know ,COMMA amusement parks and that kind of stuff .PERIOD <BREAK>
Well ,COMMA there's analog and digital .PERIOD Thought that was appropriate here .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA I'm going to skip ahead since I'm sort of running [behind] .PERIOD I want to show you quickly what I've created ,COMMA some new type of illusions .PERIOD I've done something with taking the Pixar-type illusions .PERIOD So you see these kids the same size here ,COMMA running down the hall .PERIOD The two table tops of the same size .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it's interesting ,COMMA by doing this in this sort of rendered fashion ,COMMA how much stronger the illusions are .PERIOD Any case ,COMMA I hope this has brought you a little joy and happiness ,COMMA and if you're interested in seeing more cool effects ,COMMA see me outside .PERIOD I'd be happy to show you lots of things .PERIOD <BREAK>
So I want to share with you a couple key insights about complexity we're learning from studying nature that maybe are applicable to other problems .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'm here today ,COMMA as June said ,COMMA to talk about a project that my twin sister and I have been doing for the past three and half years .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is our invocation in crochet of a bleached reef .PERIOD <BREAK>
So we went and taught the techniques .PERIOD We did workshops and lectures .PERIOD <BREAK>
The frilly crenulated forms that you see in corals ,COMMA and kelps ,COMMA and sponges and nudibranchs ,COMMA is a form of geometry known as hyperbolic geometry .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the only way that mathematicians know how to model this structure is with crochet .PERIOD It happens to be a fact .PERIOD <BREAK>
Before hyperbolic geometry ,COMMA mathematicians knew about two kinds of space :COLON Euclidean space ,COMMA and spherical space .PERIOD <BREAK>
And they have different properties .PERIOD <BREAK>
Think of the surface of a sphere -- just like a beach ball ,COMMA the surface of the Earth .PERIOD <BREAK>
And on the surface of a sphere ,COMMA a straight line is the biggest possible circle you can draw .PERIOD <BREAK>
To a mathematician if there are two answers ,COMMA and the first two are zero and one ,COMMA there is another number that immediately suggests itself as the third alternative .PERIOD <BREAK>
This nearly drove mathematicians bonkers because ,COMMA like you ,COMMA they're sitting there feeling bamboozled .PERIOD <BREAK>
I've stitched Euclid's parallel postulate on to the surface .PERIOD <BREAK>
Here's two creatures who've never heard of Euclid's parallel postulate -- didn't know it was impossible to violate ,COMMA and they're simply getting on with it .PERIOD <BREAK>
I once asked the mathematicians why it was that mathematicians thought this structure was impossible when sea slugs have been doing it since the Silurian age .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that's true .PERIOD But it also goes deeper than that .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so ,COMMA too ,COMMA we've discovered that there is an infinite taxonomy of crochet hyperbolic creatures .PERIOD <BREAK>
But we found that when we deviated from the specific setness of the mathematical code that underlies it -- the simple algorithm crochet three ,COMMA increase one -- when we deviated from that and made embellishments to the code ,COMMA the models immediately started to look more natural .PERIOD <BREAK>
And kindergarten was actually a very formalized system of education ,COMMA established by a man named Friedrich Froebel ,COMMA who was a crystallographer in the 19 th century .PERIOD <BREAK>
He developed a radical alternative system of engaging the smallest children with the most abstract ideas through physical forms of play .PERIOD <BREAK>
OK ,COMMA so how do you study this mysterious organ ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
So let me give you a few striking examples of this .PERIOD <BREAK>
And if you look ,COMMA tucked away inside the inner surface of the temporal lobes -- you can't see it there -- is a little structure called the fusiform gyrus .PERIOD <BREAK>
But there's another rare syndrome ,COMMA so rare ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA that very few physicians have heard about it ,COMMA not even neurologists .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA the most common interpretation of this ,COMMA which you find in all the psychiatry textbooks ,COMMA is a Freudian view ,COMMA and that is that this chap -- and the same argument applies to women ,COMMA by the way ,COMMA but I'll just talk about guys .PERIOD <BREAK>
Thank God ,COMMA or you would all be sexually aroused when you saw your mother .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's very ingenious ,COMMA as all Freudian arguments are -- -- but didn't make much sense because I have seen the same delusion ,COMMA a patient having the same delusion ,COMMA about his pet poodle .PERIOD <BREAK>
There are neurons there that are sensitive to faces .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA when that area's damaged ,COMMA you lose the ability to see faces ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And then the message cascades into the amygdala ,COMMA and then goes down the autonomic nervous system .PERIOD <BREAK>
There's no delusion through the phone .PERIOD <BREAK>
And in fact ,COMMA one student asked me the other day ,COMMA Do they get phantom PMS ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA why would a phantom limb be paralyzed ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
How do you unlearn the learned paralysis ,COMMA so you can relieve him of this excruciating ,COMMA clenching spasm of the phantom arm ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
He had a brachial avulsion ,COMMA so the nerves were cut and the arm was paralyzed ,COMMA lying in a sling for a year ,COMMA and then the arm was amputated .PERIOD <BREAK>
My first patient came in ,COMMA and he looked in the mirror ,COMMA and I said ,COMMA Look at your reflection of your phantom .PERIOD <BREAK>
He knows it's a mirror reflection ,COMMA but it's a vivid sensory experience .PERIOD <BREAK>
And he says ,COMMA Oh my God ,COMMA my phantom is moving again .PERIOD I don't believe this !EXCLAMATIONMARK <BREAK>
And then I said ,COMMA Close your eyes .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA I said ,COMMA Look ,COMMA Derek -- well ,COMMA first of all ,COMMA the guy can't just go around carrying a mirror to alleviate his pain -- I said ,COMMA Look ,COMMA Derek ,COMMA take it home and practice with it for a week or two .PERIOD <BREAK>
I said ,COMMA What's gone ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
These people muddle up their senses .PERIOD <BREAK>
Why does this happen ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Now remember -- why does this happen ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And that is ,COMMA there is an abnormal gene ,COMMA a mutation in the gene that causes this abnormal cross wiring .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA every brain region is wired to every other region ,COMMA and these are trimmed down to create the characteristic modular architecture of the adult brain .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's because you're all doing a cross-model synesthetic abstraction ,COMMA meaning you're saying that that sharp inflection -- ki-ki ,COMMA in your auditory cortex ,COMMA the hair cells being excited -- Kiki ,COMMA mimics the visual inflection ,COMMA sudden inflection of that jagged shape .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA this is very important ,COMMA because what it's telling you is your brain is engaging in a primitive -- it's just -- it looks like a silly illusion ,COMMA but these photons in your eye are doing this shape ,COMMA and hair cells in your ear are exciting the auditory pattern ,COMMA but the brain is able to extract the common denominator .PERIOD <BREAK>
Sorry about that .PERIOD <BREAK>
My talk will be in two parts .PERIOD I'll talk first as an astronomer ,COMMA and then as a worried member of the human race .PERIOD <BREAK>
So that's another project for NASA .PERIOD <BREAK>
It landed on the surface .PERIOD This is pictures taken on the way down .PERIOD <BREAK>
There's scant chance of life there -- that's because there's been no time for the nuclear fusion in stars to make silicon and carbon and iron ,COMMA the building blocks of planets and of life .PERIOD <BREAK>
And until we have that synthesis ,COMMA we won't be able to understand the very beginning of our universe because when our universe was itself the size of an atom ,COMMA quantum effects could shake everything .PERIOD <BREAK>
You want to not only synthesize the very large and the very small ,COMMA but we want to understand the very complex .PERIOD <BREAK>
We depend on stars to make the atoms we're made of .PERIOD <BREAK>
We depend on chemistry to determine our complex structure .PERIOD <BREAK>
The geometric mean of the mass of a proton and the mass of the sun is 50 kilograms ,COMMA within a factor of two of the mass of each person here .PERIOD <BREAK>
If I was not a self-effacing Brit ,COMMA I would mention the book myself ,COMMA and I would add that it's available in paperback .PERIOD <BREAK>
First ,COMMA any scientific discovery has benign consequences as well as dangerous ones .PERIOD <BREAK>
He persuaded Einstein ,COMMA as his last act ,COMMA to sign the famous memorandum of Bertrand Russell .PERIOD <BREAK>
We need not just campaigning physicists ,COMMA but we need biologists ,COMMA computer experts and environmentalists as well .PERIOD <BREAK>
I wrote my book ,COMMA Our Final Century ,COMMA as a scientist ,COMMA just a general scientist .PERIOD But there's one respect ,COMMA I think ,COMMA in which being a cosmologist offered a special perspective ,COMMA and that's that it offers an awareness of the immense future .PERIOD <BREAK>
The stupendous time spans of the evolutionary past are now part of common culture -- outside the American Bible Belt ,COMMA anyway -- but most people ,COMMA even those who are familiar with evolution ,COMMA aren't mindful that even more time lies ahead .PERIOD <BREAK>
The unfolding of intelligence and complexity still has immensely far to go ,COMMA here on Earth and probably far beyond .PERIOD <BREAK>
But let's suppose some aliens had been watching our pale blue dot in the cosmos from afar ,COMMA not just for 40 years ,COMMA but for the entire 45 billion-year history of our Earth .PERIOD <BREAK>
Then other things happened even more abruptly .PERIOD <BREAK>
Right now ,COMMA he's in a forest in Georgia .PERIOD <BREAK>
The Bonobo ,COMMA although shorter than us and their arms still longer ,COMMA is more upright ,COMMA just as we are .PERIOD <BREAK>
Slim-bodied ,COMMA Bonobos are by nature very gentle creatures .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is Kanzi and I ,COMMA in the forest .PERIOD <BREAK>
We need more sticks ,COMMA too .PERIOD <BREAK>
Good job .PERIOD <BREAK>
Video :COLON Kanzi now makes his tools ,COMMA just as our ancestors may have made them ,COMMA two-and-a-half million years ago -- by holding the rocks in both hands ,COMMA to strike one against the other .PERIOD <BREAK>
Kanzi's rock is from Gona ,COMMA Ethiopia and is identical to that used by our African ancestors two-and-a-half million years ago .PERIOD <BREAK>
She's also saying the name of that ,COMMA with her voice .PERIOD <BREAK>
Panbanisha began writing the lexigrams on the forest floor .PERIOD <BREAK>
SS :COLON Very nice .PERIOD Beautiful ,COMMA Panbanisha .PERIOD <BREAK>
The curved line is very similar to the lexigram .PERIOD <BREAK>
The next symbol Panbanisha writes represents collar .PERIOD <BREAK>
Researchers began to record what Panbanisha said ,COMMA by writing lexigrams on the floor with chalk .PERIOD <BREAK>
Then he peers eagerly into his mother's mouth .PERIOD <BREAK>
Narrator :COLON Kanzi plays the xylophone ;SEMICOLON using both hands he enthusiastically accompanies Dr .PERIOD Sue's singing .PERIOD <BREAK>
Kanzi and Panbanisha are stimulated by this fun-filled environment ,COMMA which promotes the emergence of these cultural capabilities .PERIOD <BREAK>
So we have a bi-species environment ,COMMA we call it a panhomoculture .PERIOD <BREAK>
Here's a site which allows you to look at recovery spending in California .PERIOD <BREAK>
In fact ,COMMA this is the graph of the number of data sets in the repositories of datagov ,COMMA and datagovuk .PERIOD <BREAK>
And then you can select also other things on the map to see what other factors ,COMMA like the threat level .PERIOD <BREAK>
The light blue is refugee camps these volunteers had spotted from the [satellite images] .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA if you've been involved in that at all ,COMMA I just wanted to say :COLON Whatever you've been doing ,COMMA whether you've just been chanting ,COMMA Raw data now !EXCLAMATIONMARK <BREAK>
A man-made moon visible by ordinary citizens ,COMMA it inspired awe and pride that humans had finally launched an object into space .PERIOD <BREAK>
Within a year ,COMMA Congress funded huge weapons increases ,COMMA and we went from 1200 nuclear weapons to 20000 .PERIOD <BREAK>
Support for engineering ,COMMA math and science -- education in general -- boomed .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so ,COMMA if you'll put up with this ,COMMA I would like to enlist your help with a first experiment today .PERIOD The experiment is -- and I notice ,COMMA by the way ,COMMA that when you applauded ,COMMA that you did it in a typical North American way ,COMMA that is ,COMMA you were raucous and incoherent .PERIOD <BREAK>
So what do we make of that ?QUESTIONMARK First of all ,COMMA we know that you're all brilliant .PERIOD <BREAK>
Do you need to be alive ?QUESTIONMARK I mean ,COMMA that's a spooky thought ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And you see that in nature .PERIOD <BREAK>
Keep in mind that ,COMMA although it looks as if each individual is acting to cooperate ,COMMA what's really going on is a kind of selfish Darwinian behavior .PERIOD <BREAK>
Each is scattering away at random to try to save its scales or feathers .PERIOD <BREAK>
As I say ,COMMA if you're in a swarm ,COMMA your odds of being the unlucky one are reduced as compared to a small group .PERIOD <BREAK>
There doesn't seem to be anything mystical about this .PERIOD <BREAK>
Specifically ,COMMA it's male fireflies who are all flashing in perfect time together ,COMMA in perfect synchrony ,COMMA to reinforce a message to the females .PERIOD <BREAK>
Scientific papers were published saying it was twitching eyelids that explained it ,COMMA or ,COMMA you know ,COMMA a human being's tendency to see patterns where there are none .PERIOD <BREAK>
But I hope you've convinced yourself now ,COMMA with this nighttime video ,COMMA that they really were very well synchronized .PERIOD <BREAK>
Okay ,COMMA well ,COMMA the issue then is ,COMMA do we need to be alive to see this kind of spontaneous order ,COMMA and I've already hinted that the answer is no .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA you might think that's a bizarre idea .PERIOD <BREAK>
He would shoot his light saber across the abyss ,COMMA making a blade of light ,COMMA and then scamper across on this blade of light .PERIOD <BREAK>
Think of the bridge as being like this platform .PERIOD <BREAK>
Narrator :COLON The most dramatic and shocking footage shows whole sections of the crowd -- hundreds of people -- apparently rocking from side to side in unison ,COMMA not only with each other ,COMMA but with the bridge .PERIOD <BREAK>
This synchronized movement seemed to be driving the bridge .PERIOD <BREAK>
But how could the crowd become synchronized ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Allan McRobie is a bridge engineer from Cambridge who wrote to me ,COMMA suggesting that a bridge simulator ought to wobble in the same way as the real bridge -- provided we hung it on pendulums of exactly the right length .PERIOD <BREAK>
Their instructions :COLON just walk normally .PERIOD <BREAK>
That indeed ,COMMA a mass extinction was underway in our fields ,COMMA in our agricultural system .PERIOD <BREAK>
So if I were to going to show you all the beans in the world ,COMMA and I had a slide like this ,COMMA and I switched it every second ,COMMA it would take up my entire TED talk ,COMMA and I wouldn't have to say anything .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I said ,COMMA You know what ?QUESTIONMARK These apples come from your ancestors ,COMMA and your ancestors gave them the greatest honor they could give them .PERIOD <BREAK>
The bad news is they're extinct .PERIOD <BREAK>
The coldest growing seasons of the future ,COMMA hotter than the hottest of the past .PERIOD <BREAK>
And then there are just daily disasters that take place in these buildings ,COMMA financial problems and mismanagement and equipment failures ,COMMA and all kinds of things ,COMMA and every time something like this happens ,COMMA it means extinction .PERIOD We lose diversity .PERIOD <BREAK>
Because ,COMMA quite literally ,COMMA if agriculture doesn't adapt to climate change ,COMMA neither will we .PERIOD <BREAK>
Important health message :COLON blogging may be hazardous to your health ,COMMA especially if you are a male .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is male blogging posture sitting ,COMMA and the result is ,COMMA For greater comfort ,COMMA men naturally sit with their legs farther apart than women ,COMMA when working on laptop .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is a very serious research ,COMMA that you should read the underline .PERIOD <BREAK>
Wi-Fi enables you to avoid the processor .PERIOD And there are some enhanced protection measures ,COMMA which I would like to share with you ,COMMA and I would like ,COMMA in a minute ,COMMA to thank Philips for helping .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'm really troubled by that .PERIOD But anyway that's -- the basis of the thing that I want to share with you today ,COMMA though ,COMMA is that right back to where we inspire people who will be our great leaders later .PERIOD <BREAK>
Aviation Week asked me to make a list of who I thought were the movers and shakers of the first 100 years of aviation .PERIOD <BREAK>
Well ,COMMA what happened when I was a little kid was -- some pretty heavy stuff too .PERIOD <BREAK>
And this was at a time when Mars was a hell of a lot more interesting than it is now .PERIOD We thought there'd be animals there ;SEMICOLON we knew there were plants there ;SEMICOLON the colors change ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
These two new airplanes are the same speed as the DC 8 that was done in 1958 .PERIOD <BREAK>
Here's the biggie ,COMMA and that is ,COMMA you don't have innovation cycles if the government develops and the government uses it .PERIOD <BREAK>
Computers were used for artillery first ,COMMA then IRS .PERIOD <BREAK>
Keep that in mind .PERIOD I put down innovation -- I've looked for innovation cycles in space ;SEMICOLON I found none .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I think I want to talk a little bit about why we had the courage to go out and try that as a small company .PERIOD <BREAK>
But I think once it does ,COMMA we will find solutions ,COMMA and very quickly ,COMMA you'll see those resort hotels in orbit .PERIOD <BREAK>
There's a group of people that have come forward -- and you don't know all of them -- but the ones that have come forward were inspired as young children ,COMMA this little three- to 15 -year-old age ,COMMA by us going to orbit and going to the moon here ,COMMA right in this time period .PERIOD <BREAK>
Paul Allen ,COMMA Elan Musk ,COMMA Richard Branson ,COMMA Jeff Bezos ,COMMA the Ansari family ,COMMA which is now funding the Russians' sub-orbital thing ,COMMA Bob Bigelow ,COMMA a private space station ,COMMA and Carmack .PERIOD <BREAK>
There were a couple of examples here .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I'm talking about if you've got a baby now ,COMMA or if you've got a 10 -year-old now .PERIOD <BREAK>
Relatively soon ,COMMA you'll be able to buy a ticket and fly higher and faster than the highest-performance military operational airplane .PERIOD It's never happened before .PERIOD <BREAK>
You can fly with Russian hardware .PERIOD This is available because a Russian space program is starving ,COMMA and it's nice for them to get 20 million here and there to take one of the seats .PERIOD <BREAK>
And every dollar that flows into that will be spent more efficiently by a factor of 10 to 15 .PERIOD And what that means is before we know it ,COMMA the progress in human space flight ,COMMA with no taxpayer dollars ,COMMA will be at a level of about five times as much as the current NASA budgets for human space flight .PERIOD <BREAK>
And this realization is allowing us to reconceptualize the way that we actually approach these diseases by controlling angiogenesis .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now I'm going to focus on cancer because angiogenesis is a hallmark of cancer ,COMMA every type of cancer .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is a tumor :COLON dark ,COMMA gray ,COMMA ominous mass growing inside a brain .PERIOD <BREAK>
Dr .PERIOD Judah Folkman ,COMMA who was my mentor and who was the pioneer of the angiogenesis field ,COMMA once called this cancer without disease .PERIOD <BREAK>
And ,COMMA unfortunately ,COMMA this late stage of cancer is the one at which it's most likely to be diagnosed ,COMMA when angiogenesis is already turned on and cancer cells are growing like wild .PERIOD <BREAK>
We call this antiangiogenic therapy ,COMMA and it's completely different from chemotherapy because it selectively aims at the blood vessels that are feeding the cancers .PERIOD <BREAK>
Well ,COMMA I've just shown you two very different types of cancer that both responded to antiangiogenic therapy .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we subsequently treated more than 600 dogs .PERIOD <BREAK>
It had already spread to his lymph nodes ,COMMA so we used an antiangiogenic skin cream for the lip and an oral cocktail ,COMMA so we could treat from the inside as well as the outside .PERIOD <BREAK>
And ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA the first pioneering treatments for people ,COMMA as well as dogs ,COMMA are already becoming available .PERIOD <BREAK>
But the real question is :COLON How well do these work in practice ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
So here's actually the patient survival data from eight different types of cancer .PERIOD <BREAK>
But for other tumors and cancer types ,COMMA the improvements have only been modest .PERIOD <BREAK>
And as a doctor ,COMMA I know that once a disease progresses to an advanced stage ,COMMA achieving a cure can be difficult ,COMMA if not impossible .PERIOD <BREAK>
But I actually took a completely opposite approach and began asking :COLON What could we be adding to our diet that's naturally antiangiogenic ,COMMA that could boost the body's defense system and beat back those blood vessels that are feeding cancers ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
This inhibits abnormal angiogenesis by 60 percent .PERIOD <BREAK>
And you can see clearly that the teas vary in their potency from less potent to more potent .PERIOD <BREAK>
This means there's food synergy .PERIOD <BREAK>
Here's some more data from our testing .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA in the lab ,COMMA we can simulate tumor angiogenesis represented here in a black bar .PERIOD <BREAK>
Soy ,COMMA parsley ,COMMA garlic ,COMMA grapes ,COMMA berries ;SEMICOLON I could go home and cook a tasty meal using these ingredients .PERIOD <BREAK>
And ,COMMA like a tumor ,COMMA fat grows when blood vessels grow .PERIOD <BREAK>
Albert Szent-Gyorgi once said that ,COMMA Discovery consists of seeing what everyone has seen ,COMMA and thinking what no one has thought .PERIOD <BREAK>
Right .PERIOD And along those lines ,COMMA for people who might have risk factors for cancer ,COMMA would you recommend pursuing any treatments sort of prophylactically or simply pursuing the right diet with lots of tomato sauce ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Well ,COMMA you know ,COMMA there's abundant epidemiological evidence .PERIOD <BREAK>
I've designed puzzles for books ,COMMA printed things .PERIOD <BREAK>
But at best they can reach for something more and create a memorable impression .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's all figure .PERIOD <BREAK>
Not strictly an ambigram in the conventional sense .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA if you could pick up the black vase ,COMMA it would look like the figure on top .PERIOD <BREAK>
Here ,COMMA let's make it a little harder .PERIOD Still pretty easy .PERIOD <BREAK>
I wanted to make a sequel .PERIOD <BREAK>
Garry Trudeau calls himself an investigative cartoonist .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I said ,COMMA Well ,COMMA how on Earth can you come up with a sequence of the base pairs in DNA ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And you have to choose pieces that overlap on the edge .PERIOD <BREAK>
But it takes some persistence .PERIOD <BREAK>
First of all ,COMMA you know ,COMMA for a long time computer games meant things like Doom ,COMMA where you're going around shooting things ,COMMA very violent games ,COMMA very fast ,COMMA aimed at teenage boys .PERIOD Right ?QUESTIONMARK That's who plays computer games .PERIOD <BREAK>
Well ,COMMA guess what ?QUESTIONMARK That's changing .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it's a game you play with other people .PERIOD <BREAK>
A lot of people do Sudoku .PERIOD In fact some doctors prescribe it .PERIOD <BREAK>
Anybody ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
What I want to talk about today is this particular cell ,COMMA or grouping of cells ,COMMA that is in each and every one of us .PERIOD <BREAK>
I want you to imagine that this particular grouping of cells is central to the evolution of our species and the continuation of the human race .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I want you imagine that at some point in history a group of powerful people invested in owning and controlling the world understood that the suppression of this particular cell ,COMMA the oppression of these cells ,COMMA the reinterpretation of these cells ,COMMA the undermining of these cells ,COMMA getting us to believe in the weakness of these cells and the crushing ,COMMA eradicating ,COMMA destroying ,COMMA reducing these cells ,COMMA basically began the process of killing off the girl cell ,COMMA which was ,COMMA by the way ,COMMA patriarchy .PERIOD <BREAK>
To be a leader means not to be a girl .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I'd also like to say that the irony of course ,COMMA is that denying girl ,COMMA suppressing girl ,COMMA suppressing emotion ,COMMA refusing feeling has lead thus here .PERIOD <BREAK>
Where we have now come to live in a world where the most extreme forms of violence ,COMMA the most horrific poverty ,COMMA genocide ,COMMA mass rapes ,COMMA the destruction of the Earth ,COMMA is completely out of control .PERIOD <BREAK>
In the Congo ,COMMA for those of you who don't know ,COMMA there has been a war raging for the last 12 years ,COMMA a war that has killed nearly six million people .PERIOD <BREAK>
Listening to the story of 80 -year-old women who were tied to chains and circled ,COMMA and where groups of men would come and rape them periodically ,COMMA all in the name of economic exploitation to steal the minerals so the West can have it and profit from them .PERIOD <BREAK>
That shattering ,COMMA that opening of my girl cell ,COMMA that kind of massive breakthrough of my heart allowed me to become more courageous ,COMMA and braver ,COMMA and actually more clever than I had been in the past in my life .PERIOD <BREAK>
I want to change the verb .PERIOD <BREAK>
I want the verb to be educate ,COMMA or activate ,COMMA or engage ,COMMA or confront ,COMMA or defy ,COMMA or create .PERIOD <BREAK>
I know a 14 -year-old girl in the Netherlands ,COMMA for example ,COMMA who is demanding that she take a boat and go around the entire world by herself .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I want to talk about a girl that I just met recently in Bukavu ,COMMA who was impregnated by her rapist .PERIOD <BREAK>
She taught girls what a healthy vagina looked like ,COMMA and what a mutilated vagina looked like .PERIOD <BREAK>
And she said ,COMMA Well ,COMMA now ,COMMA I need a house .PERIOD <BREAK>
The whole community has bought in to what she's doing .PERIOD <BREAK>
She imagined her father killing her on one hand ,COMMA and Mama Agnes greeting her ,COMMA with the hope that she would greet her when she got to the house .PERIOD <BREAK>
I had the privilege of being in the hut when she was reunited with her father and reconciled .PERIOD <BREAK>
In that hut ,COMMA we walked in ,COMMA and her father and his four wives were sitting there ,COMMA and her sisters who had just returned because they had all fled when she had fled ,COMMA and her primary mother ,COMMA who had been beaten in standing up for her with the elders .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that is the power of transformation .PERIOD <BREAK>
But I really want to do it for each and every person here ,COMMA to value the girl in us ,COMMA to value the part that cries ,COMMA to value the part that's emotional ,COMMA to value the part that's vulnerable ,COMMA to understand that's where the future lies .PERIOD <BREAK>
I rejoice that it's still in my body .PERIOD <BREAK>
I am an emotional creature .PERIOD <BREAK>
I can take you back .PERIOD <BREAK>
Nothing's been diluted .PERIOD <BREAK>
I love ,COMMA hear me ,COMMA I love that I can feel the feelings inside you ,COMMA even if they stop my life ,COMMA even if they break my heart ,COMMA even if they take me off track ,COMMA they make me responsible .PERIOD <BREAK>
Your body is covered with fractals .PERIOD <BREAK>
Let's see ,COMMA first iteration ,COMMA second ,COMMA third ,COMMA fourth .PERIOD <BREAK>
So Native Americans use a combination of circular symmetry and fourfold symmetry .PERIOD <BREAK>
It is not the same pattern at two different scales .PERIOD <BREAK>
In some cases ,COMMA there would actually be algorithms ,COMMA and very sophisticated algorithms .PERIOD <BREAK>
So I tracked down one of the folks who makes these things ,COMMA this guy in Mali just outside of Bamako ,COMMA and I asked him ,COMMA How come you're making fractal fences ?QUESTIONMARK Because nobody else is .PERIOD <BREAK>
So these guys are right on target for a practical use of scaling technology .PERIOD <BREAK>
The most complex example of an algorithmic approach to fractals that I found was actually not in geometry ,COMMA it was in a symbolic code ,COMMA and this was Bamana sand divination .PERIOD <BREAK>
And finally ,COMMA out of desperation ,COMMA I said ,COMMA Well ,COMMA let me explain Georg Cantor in 1877 .PERIOD <BREAK>
And then you take this symbol ,COMMA and you put it back in so it's a self-generating diversity of symbols .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I know Brian Eno says there's not enough Africa in computers ,COMMA but you know ,COMMA I don't think there's enough African history in Brian Eno .PERIOD <BREAK>
We got a small seed grant ,COMMA just to see if folks would be willing to work with us on this ;SEMICOLON we're very excited about the future possibilities for that .PERIOD <BREAK>
Actually ,COMMA the reason that Google was such a success is because they were the first ones to take advantage of the self-organizing properties of the web .PERIOD <BREAK>

Anyway ,COMMA I like Oprah -- I like her girlfriendy-ness ,COMMA I like her weight issues ,COMMA I like how she's transformed talk television ,COMMA I like how she's brought reading back to America -- but there was something that happened the last two weeks that was .PERIOD I call it the Soon-Yi moment :COLON it is the moment when I cannot continue supporting someone .PERIOD <BREAK>
It makes What the Bleep Do We Know seem like a doctoral dissertation from Harvard on quantum mechanics -- that's how bad it is .PERIOD <BREAK>
I want to try to share just a little bit of that with you in this presentation .PERIOD <BREAK>
The challenge ,COMMA of course ,COMMA is to answer this question :COLON what permits this extraordinary performance of animals that allows them basically to go anywhere ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And if we could figure that out ,COMMA how can we implement those designs ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Think about it .PERIOD If you were an engineer and I told you that you had to build an automobile ,COMMA but it had to start off to be this big ,COMMA then it had to grow to be full size and had to work every step along the way .PERIOD <BREAK>
Or think about the fact that if you build an automobile ,COMMA I'll tell you that you also -- inside it -- have to put a factory that allows you to make another automobile .PERIOD <BREAK>
They all produce the pattern of a pogo stick .PERIOD How is that true ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
We took their advice and we modeled the animals moving in the horizontal plane as well .PERIOD We took their three legs ,COMMA we collapsed them down as one .PERIOD <BREAK>
It didn't decrease its preferred speed at all .PERIOD <BREAK>
It has six legs -- there are the tuned ,COMMA springy legs .PERIOD <BREAK>
Robert Full :COLON It'll go on different surfaces -- here's sand -- although we haven't perfected the feet yet ,COMMA but I'll talk about that later .PERIOD <BREAK>
Like if we had a piece of tape now ,COMMA we'd peel it this way .PERIOD <BREAK>
They do this with their toes .PERIOD It's bizarre !EXCLAMATIONMARK This peeling inspired iRobot -- that we work with -- to build Mecho-Geckos .PERIOD <BREAK>
And here's the peeling action of the Mecho-Gecko .PERIOD <BREAK>
Here's an individual hair with a little split end there .PERIOD <BREAK>
No ,COMMA force is too low .PERIOD Do they do it by electrostatics ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And just recently we've made a breakthrough ,COMMA where we now believe we're going to be able to create the first synthetic ,COMMA self-cleaning ,COMMA dry adhesive .PERIOD Many companies are interested in this .PERIOD <BREAK>
Thank you .PERIOD <BREAK>
We proved that most of the ammonia refrigeration tables are wrong .PERIOD <BREAK>
Most people have cooking fires in the world ,COMMA whether it's camel dung or wood .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the problem is this :COLON Women are not making it to the top of any profession anywhere in the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
We also have another problem ,COMMA which is that women face harder choices between professional success and personal fulfillment .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I said ,COMMA Are you telling me that I am the only woman to have pitched a deal in this office in a year ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
In the high-income part of our workforce ,COMMA in the people who end up at the top -- Fortune 500 CEO jobs ,COMMA or the equivalent in other industries -- the problem ,COMMA I am convinced ,COMMA is that women are dropping out .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is hard .PERIOD I feel guilty sometimes .PERIOD <BREAK>
My brother is kind of busy .PERIOD <BREAK>
Because what the data shows ,COMMA above all else ,COMMA is one thing ,COMMA which is that success and likeability are positively correlated for men and negatively correlated for women .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is the complication .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that's a problem ,COMMA because we have to make it as important a job ,COMMA because it's the hardest job in the world to work inside the home ,COMMA for people of both genders ,COMMA if we're going to even things out and let women stay in the workforce .PERIOD <BREAK>
Message number three :COLON don't leave before you leave .PERIOD <BREAK>
And literally from that moment ,COMMA she doesn't raise her hand anymore ,COMMA she doesn't look for a promotion ,COMMA she doesn't take on the new project ,COMMA she doesn't say ,COMMA Me .PERIOD I want to do that .PERIOD <BREAK>
My generation really ,COMMA sadly ,COMMA is not going to change the numbers at the top .PERIOD <BREAK>
If you want to get at the big part -- I mean from a public health level ,COMMA where my training is -- you're looking at behavioral issues .PERIOD <BREAK>
We talk about it in terms of engagement ,COMMA or non-compliance .PERIOD <BREAK>
So the crux of it comes down to this notion of decision-making -- giving information to people in a form that doesn't just educate them or inform them ,COMMA but actually leads them to make better decisions ,COMMA better choices in their lives .PERIOD <BREAK>
So they asked them at the beginning ,COMMA Do you think you'll actually be able to stick with this program ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
So fear showed up as not really the driver .PERIOD <BREAK>
It was a notion that really came out of Albert Bandura's work ,COMMA who studied whether people could get a sense of empowerment .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's an amazing notion .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I had to explain ,COMMA They're trying to scare people .PERIOD <BREAK>
Again ,COMMA Bandura recognized this years ago ,COMMA decades ago .PERIOD <BREAK>
Okay ,COMMA I know where I sit .PERIOD I know where I'm situated .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that doesn't just work for me in terms of abstract numbers -- this overload of health information that we're inundated with .PERIOD <BREAK>
Finally ,COMMA we need to be presented with a clear point of action .PERIOD <BREAK>
The choice in this case is pretty simple .PERIOD <BREAK>
We either keep going fast ,COMMA or we slow down .PERIOD <BREAK>
They reduce speeds by about five to 10 percent .PERIOD <BREAK>
They last for about five miles ,COMMA in which case we put our foot back on the pedal .PERIOD <BREAK>
And who among us would actually say that people who do try to read this actually get anything out of it ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
They went to the nutritional information box and saw that what works for cereal ,COMMA works for our food ,COMMA actually helps people understand what's in their food .PERIOD <BREAK>
They're just not for us .PERIOD They're not for people .PERIOD They're not for patients .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is the worst presented information .PERIOD <BREAK>
And then we go a further step -- we tell them what they can do .PERIOD <BREAK>
So we take the bold step of putting the cholesterol information on the same page ,COMMA which is the way the doctor is going to evaluate it .PERIOD <BREAK>
The last one I'll show you is a PSA test .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the only acceptable answer is -- -- yes .PERIOD <BREAK>
Okay .PERIOD On the other hand by placing your finger in a different position on the fingerboard it changes the string length ,COMMA that changes the frequency of the sound wave .PERIOD <BREAK>
And now ,COMMA I realize that as the musician ,COMMA we human beings ,COMMA we have a great mind ,COMMA artistic heart and skill that can change the 16 th-century technology and a legendary design to a wonderful entertainment .PERIOD <BREAK>
But .PERIOD although some of them were quite up there for me .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I realized we actually had quite a bit in common :COLON both of us were disseminating the genes of one species and not another ,COMMA and both of us -- probably ,COMMA if I can imagine the bee's point of view -- thought we were calling the shots .PERIOD <BREAK>
We have a grammar that suggests that's who we are ;SEMICOLON that we are sovereign subjects in nature ,COMMA the bee as well as me .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that's when I got the idea ,COMMA which was ,COMMA Well ,COMMA what would happen if we kind of looked at us from this point of view of these other species who are working on us ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And agriculture suddenly appeared to me not as an invention ,COMMA not as a human technology ,COMMA but as a co-evolutionary development in which a group of very clever species ,COMMA mostly edible grasses ,COMMA had exploited us ,COMMA figured out how to get us to basically deforest the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
And suddenly everything looked different .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'm a dupe .PERIOD I'm a dupe of the lawns ,COMMA whose goal in life is to outcompete the trees ,COMMA who they compete with for sunlight .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA let me go through what you gain when you look at the world this way ,COMMA besides some entertaining insights about human desire .PERIOD <BREAK>
As an intellectual matter ,COMMA looking at the world from other species' points of view helps us deal with this weird anomaly ,COMMA which is -- and this is in the realm of intellectual history -- which is that we have this Darwinian revolution 150 years ago .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is a farm in the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia .PERIOD <BREAK>
the idea is he's got six different species of animals ,COMMA as well as some plants ,COMMA growing in this very elaborate symbiotic arrangement .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I'll show you ,COMMA if you take this approach ,COMMA what you get ,COMMA OK ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
So ,COMMA one day ,COMMA cattle in a pen .PERIOD <BREAK>
The Eggmobile is a very rickety contraption -- it looks like a prairie schooner made out of boards -- but it houses 350 chickens .PERIOD <BREAK>
So the chickens do their kind of little breakdance and they're pushing around the manure to get at the grubs ,COMMA and in the process they're spreading the manure out .PERIOD <BREAK>
And within four or five weeks ,COMMA he can do it again .PERIOD <BREAK>
Put that in play .PERIOD <BREAK>
So when they lose a lot of leaf mass ,COMMA they shed roots ;SEMICOLON they kind of cauterize them and the roots die .PERIOD <BREAK>
And they're labeled by color right now ,COMMA by language .PERIOD <BREAK>
But you can also see ,COMMA there are places where there's not so much .PERIOD <BREAK>
But it didn't have quite the same pickup in the US .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so I guess the US .PERIOD finally ,COMMA finally started to like it ,COMMA too .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it's something I'm very excited to be a part of .PERIOD <BREAK>
But it was a dream of his ,COMMA and we ,COMMA basically ,COMMA when people really want to do something ,COMMA well ,COMMA we generally let them .PERIOD <BREAK>
You can see ,COMMA even though the US .PERIOD is still the majority here -- though ,COMMA by the way ,COMMA search-wise ,COMMA it's only about 30 percent of our traffic -- but it's already going to Japan ,COMMA and the UK ,COMMA and Europe ,COMMA and all the rest of the countries .PERIOD <BREAK>
And -- well ,COMMA I'll leave you in suspense .PERIOD <BREAK>
So one of the things -- both Sergey and I went to a Montessori school ,COMMA and I think ,COMMA for some reason ,COMMA this has been incorporated in Google .PERIOD <BREAK>
And Sergey mentioned Orkut ,COMMA which is something that ,COMMA you know ,COMMA Orkut wanted to do in his time ,COMMA and we call this -- at Google ,COMMA we've embodied this as the 20 percent time ,COMMA and the idea is ,COMMA for 20 percent of your time ,COMMA if you're working at Google ,COMMA you can do what you think is the best thing to do .PERIOD <BREAK>
And this was kind of a surprise to me ,COMMA but we found that as long as you keep the 100 things in your head ,COMMA which you did by writing them down ,COMMA that you could do a pretty good job deciding what to do and where to put your resources .PERIOD <BREAK>
So this is a new -- how many of you use the Google Toolbar ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And the nice thing about this ,COMMA we have a self-serve program ,COMMA and many thousands of websites have signed up ,COMMA and this let's them really make money .PERIOD And I -- you know ,COMMA there's a number of people I met -- I met this guy who runs a conservation site at a party ,COMMA and he said ,COMMA You know ,COMMA I wasn't making any money .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so there is this blog of a young person who was kind of depressed ,COMMA and he said ,COMMA You know ,COMMA I'm sleeping a lot .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I think we're really lucky to have that kind of business model because everyone in the world has access to our search ,COMMA and I think that's a tremendous ,COMMA tremendous benefit .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA I'm also fairly determined to try and build a game layer on top of the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's not very good .PERIOD It's cluttered .PERIOD <BREAK>
If you're not ,COMMA too bad .PERIOD There's nothing you can do .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's actually about using dynamics ,COMMA using forces ,COMMA to influence the behavior of where you are ,COMMA what you do there ,COMMA how you do it .PERIOD <BREAK>
Come here at a certain time ,COMMA get your drinks half off .PERIOD <BREAK>
This game dynamic is so powerful that it doesn't just influence our behavior ,COMMA it's influenced our entire culture .PERIOD <BREAK>
They will return like clockwork at different times .PERIOD <BREAK>
Modern Warfare ,COMMA one of the most successful selling games of all time .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's also used in more conventional settings and can be used more consciously in conventional settings .PERIOD <BREAK>
School -- and remember ,COMMA I made it through one year ,COMMA so I think I'm qualified to talk on school -- is a game ,COMMA it's just not a terribly well-designed game ,COMMA right .PERIOD <BREAK>
There are statuses .PERIOD I mean ,COMMA what is valedictorian ,COMMA but a status ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
That sucks .PERIOD Why not level-up ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And it's very powerful .PERIOD <BREAK>
I mean ,COMMA you see this is a paladin level 10 ,COMMA and that's a paladin level 20 ,COMMA and if you were going to fight ,COMMA you know ,COMMA orcs on the fields of Mordor against the Raz al Ghul ,COMMA you'd probably want to be the bigger one ,COMMA right .PERIOD <BREAK>
Their most dedicated players ,COMMA it's like a full-time job .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we've introduced a progression dynamic into it ,COMMA where ,COMMA by going to the same place over and over ,COMMA by doing challenges ,COMMA by engaging with the business ,COMMA you move a green bar from the left edge of the screen to the right edge of the screen ,COMMA and you eventually unlock rewards .PERIOD <BREAK>
So we have to use this one carefully .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's a woodworking machine ,COMMA or at least a piece of one ,COMMA and my task was to make this thing a little bit more modern ,COMMA a little bit easier to use .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now this gentleman ,COMMA Isambard Kingdom Brunel ,COMMA designed many great things in his career in the 19 th century ,COMMA including the Clifton suspension bridge in Bristol and the Thames tunnel at Rotherhithe .PERIOD <BREAK>
His greatest creation runs actually right through here in Oxford .PERIOD <BREAK>
He imagined an integrated transportation system in which it would be possible for a passenger to embark on a train in London and disembark from a ship in New York .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I'd like to talk about some of those just for the next few minutes .PERIOD <BREAK>
So it took a team working in India with patients and community health workers to understand how a PDA and an application on a PDA might replace those technicians in a fitting and diagnostic service .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the faster we do that ,COMMA the faster our ideas evolve .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is the manufacturing facility for one of their biggest cost breakthroughs .PERIOD <BREAK>
They went from retreating to the nurse's station to discuss the various states and needs of patients ,COMMA to developing a system that happened on the ward in front of patients ,COMMA using a simple software tool .PERIOD <BREAK>
And this is just one of thousands of opportunities in healthcare alone .PERIOD <BREAK>
But ,COMMA again ,COMMA we are in the midst of massive change .PERIOD <BREAK>
How might we improve access to safe drinking water for the world's poorest people ,COMMA and at the same time stimulate innovation amongst local water providers ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
What kinds of questions do we think design thinking could be used to tackle ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
There is a hash tag there that you can use ,COMMA #CBDQ .PERIOD <BREAK>
Well ,COMMA since I couldn't have my tea the way I wanted it ,COMMA I ordered a cup of coffee ,COMMA which the waiter brought over promptly .PERIOD <BREAK>
But from the Japanese perspective ,COMMA it's their duty to protect those who don't know any better -- in this case ,COMMA the ignorant gaijin -- from making the wrong choice .PERIOD <BREAK>
As I do so ,COMMA I hope you'll start thinking about some of your own assumptions and how they were shaped by your backgrounds .PERIOD <BREAK>
It is essential for success .PERIOD <BREAK>
The kids got to choose which pile of anagrams they would like to do ,COMMA and they even got to choose which marker they would write their answers with .PERIOD <BREAK>
In reality ,COMMA the kids who were told what to do ,COMMA whether by Miss Smith or their mothers ,COMMA were actually given the very same activity ,COMMA which their counterparts in the first group had freely chosen .PERIOD <BREAK>
In fact ,COMMA some of the kids were visibly embarrassed when they were told that their mothers had been consulted .PERIOD <BREAK>
The first-generation children were strongly influenced by their immigrant parents' approach to choice .PERIOD <BREAK>
Or ,COMMA you could say that the individual's preferences were shaped by the preferences of specific others .PERIOD <BREAK>
Americans train their whole lives to play spot the difference .PERIOD <BREAK>
A number of my studies have shown that when you give people 10 or more options when they're making a choice ,COMMA they make poorer decisions ,COMMA whether it be health care ,COMMA investment ,COMMA other critical areas .PERIOD <BREAK>
They'd already picked out a name for her ,COMMA Barbara ,COMMA after her grandmother .PERIOD <BREAK>
Unable to breathe on her own ,COMMA she was put on a ventilator .PERIOD <BREAK>
This narrative promises so much :COLON freedom ,COMMA happiness ,COMMA success .PERIOD <BREAK>
Instead of replacing one story with another ,COMMA we can learn from and revel in the many versions that exist and the many that have yet to be written .PERIOD <BREAK>
No matter where we're from and what your narrative is ,COMMA we all have a responsibility to open ourselves up to a wider array of what choice can do ,COMMA and what it can represent .PERIOD <BREAK>
It brings us that much closer to realizing the full potential of choice ,COMMA to inspiring the hope and achieving the freedom that choice promises but doesn't always deliver .PERIOD <BREAK>
So I brought these two bottles of nail polish into the laboratory ,COMMA and I stripped the labels off .PERIOD <BREAK>
Well ,COMMA good morning .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it's not just what these are doing to each other ,COMMA but it's what the audience thinks that really frames this matter .PERIOD <BREAK>
To get a sense of this ,COMMA and it's been a theme we've talked about all week ,COMMA I recently talked to a bunch of tweeners .PERIOD <BREAK>
Girl 5 :COLON Because they're going to lose all their money eventually .PERIOD <BREAK>
Doesn't work out too well for them ,COMMA they lose money .PERIOD <BREAK>
The rocket's position is shown by the trajectory that we're now looking at .PERIOD <BREAK>
And as it reaches the peak of its trajectory ,COMMA the velocity ,COMMA you will notice ,COMMA has dropped off to a minimum .PERIOD <BREAK>
But like ,COMMA let's imagine we took the latest Pentium processor ,COMMA the latest Core 2 Extreme ,COMMA which is a four-core processor that Intel's working on ,COMMA it will be our laptop tomorrow .PERIOD <BREAK>
So -- and we haven't even worked out the cooling needs .PERIOD <BREAK>
Every effort has been made and will continue to be made to find a new pattern ,COMMA new selling arrangements and new types of programs that may arrest the declining revenues .PERIOD <BREAK>
It may yet be possible to eke out a poor existence for radio ,COMMA but I don't know how .PERIOD <BREAK>
It was the dawn of interactive TV ,COMMA and you may have noticed they wanted to sell you the Winky Dink kits .PERIOD <BREAK>
Pete ,COMMA I could use any ordinary open-source crayon ,COMMA why do I have to buy theirs ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
But we will discuss this scandal ,COMMA because this man ,COMMA Jack Berry ,COMMA the host of Winky Dink ,COMMA went on to become the host of Twenty One ,COMMA one of the most important quiz shows ever .PERIOD <BREAK>
We'll talk a little bit more about him later .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's the era of big business and data centers for computing .PERIOD <BREAK>
It all happened within five miles of where I'm standing ,COMMA at Stanford University ,COMMA between 1960 and 1975 .PERIOD <BREAK>
HyperCard was the first program to introduce the public to hyperlinks ,COMMA where you could randomly hook to any kind of picture ,COMMA or piece of text ,COMMA or data across a file system ,COMMA and we had no way of explaining it .PERIOD <BREAK>
Once it was only a dream of technoids and a few long-forgotten politicians .PERIOD <BREAK>
And further stimulus came with the deregulation of the cable television industry ,COMMA and the re-regulation of the cable television industry .PERIOD <BREAK>
Voice 2 :COLON Next on the gourmet pet channel ,COMMA decorating birthday cakes for your schnauzer .PERIOD <BREAK>
We come into the era of the dotcom ,COMMA the World Wide Web ,COMMA and I don't need to tell you about that because we all went through that bubble together .PERIOD <BREAK>
Voice 1 :COLON You'll have to stay here in the safe house until we get word the terrorist threat is over .PERIOD <BREAK>
And media companies realize the audience is important also .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I think this is beginning to happen in the entertainment business .PERIOD <BREAK>
They think of the old medium ,COMMA because the old medium is always the content of the new medium ,COMMA as movies tend to be the content of TV ,COMMA and as books used to be the content ,COMMA novels used to be the content of movies .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I used three criteria :COLON the first was ,COMMA I thought I'd talk about real design within reach ,COMMA design that's free ,COMMA not design not quite within reach ,COMMA as we're fondly known by our competition and competitors ,COMMA but stuff that you can find on the streets ,COMMA stuff that was free ,COMMA stuff that was available to all people ,COMMA and stuff that probably contains some other important messages .PERIOD <BREAK>
Wholly inconsistent with San Francisco or New York .PERIOD <BREAK>
How did I get started in this business ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
In Italy ,COMMA you know ,COMMA almost everything ,COMMA kind of ,COMMA looks good .PERIOD <BREAK>
I've come across some other just ,COMMA kind of ,COMMA curious relationships of bollards on the street that have different interpretations ,COMMA but -- these things amuse me .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I came down one day ,COMMA and all the bikes were red .PERIOD <BREAK>
And at that moment ,COMMA the sun came out ,COMMA and through this perforated screen ,COMMA a pattern was cast over these bodies and they kind of faded into the rear ,COMMA and we left the restaurant kind of feeling OK .PERIOD about stuff .PERIOD <BREAK>
Cities are the place where we're most likely to encounter diversity and to mix with other people .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it's a welcoming area ,COMMA I think ,COMMA inclusive of diversity ,COMMA reflective of diversity ,COMMA and I think this marriage of both technology and art in the public sector is an area where the US .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I decided I had to get closer than just drawing fantasy airplanes .PERIOD <BREAK>
You had to learn what made an airplane stay in the air .PERIOD <BREAK>
I had to learn mathematics and mechanics and all this sort of thing .PERIOD <BREAK>
So I chose furniture .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I chose chairs specifically because I knew something about them .PERIOD <BREAK>
There are drawbacks to this .PERIOD <BREAK>
One is :COLON you can't accommodate everybody .PERIOD <BREAK>
So he said ,COMMA Well I'll come over and look at it .PERIOD <BREAK>
So here we are .PERIOD <BREAK>
So if you watch this chair as I recline ,COMMA the headrest comes up to meet my neck .PERIOD <BREAK>
You cant hit your elbow on bottom .PERIOD <BREAK>
What does that mean ,COMMA my environment ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And you realize that you spend it in a variety of different places .PERIOD <BREAK>
You spend it at rest and you spend it at work .PERIOD <BREAK>
So then I decided to leave that part of the world ,COMMA and I was going to go to the mid-west .PERIOD <BREAK>
Very nice ,COMMA and there my older ,COMMA senior lungs ,COMMA as I like to call them ,COMMA I filled with particulate matter ,COMMA carbon dioxide and very high doses of ozone .PERIOD <BREAK>
Okay ?QUESTIONMARK Almost like the highest in the nation .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA what's wrong with this picture ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
They haven't asked me what kind of the quality of the drinking water that I put in my mouth or the food that I ingest into my stomach .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA I've circled the places where I've been .PERIOD <BREAK>
Oh ,COMMA not so lucky .PERIOD <BREAK>
They give us some sense of what's going to be our train wreck .PERIOD <BREAK>
And all of those black dots are all of the toxic release inventories that are monitored by the EPA .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is what the physician would have in front of him and her when we enter that exam room instead of just the pink slip that said I paid at the counter .PERIOD Right ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And I believe that geographic information can make both you and me very healthy .PERIOD Thank you .PERIOD <BREAK>
So .PERIOD <BREAK>
They take you to gruff-ex-cop-on-his-fourth-marriagedad .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'd be like some kind of Internet genius ,COMMA and me ,COMMA I'd like to upgrade to deity and maybe just like that -- pop !EXCLAMATIONMARK -- I'd go wireless .PERIOD <BREAK>
I could zip through your servers and firewalls like a virus until the World Wide Web is as wise ,COMMA as wild and as organized as I think a modern-day miracle/oracle can get ,COMMA but ,COMMA ooh-eee ,COMMA you want to bet just how whack and un-PC your Mac or PC is going to be when I'm rocking hot-shit-hot-shot-godnet ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
You don't say a prayer .PERIOD <BREAK>
Thank you ,COMMA TED .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA for roughly 300 years ,COMMA the hot debate in architecture was whether the number five or the number seven was a better proportion to think about architecture ,COMMA because the nose was one-fifth of your head ,COMMA or because your head was one-seventh of your body .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA whenever you lost information ,COMMA you'd move to symmetry ;SEMICOLON whenever you added information to a system ,COMMA you would break symmetry .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA the only way we could design that ,COMMA or possibly construct it ,COMMA is by using a calculus-based definition of the form .PERIOD <BREAK>
It also is much more dynamic ,COMMA so that you can see that the same form opens and closes in a very dynamic way as you move across it ,COMMA because it has this quality of vector in motion built into it .PERIOD <BREAK>
You just need to incorporate a certain number of traits in a very kind of genetic way .PERIOD <BREAK>
I won't go into too much description of any of these projects ,COMMA but what you can see is that the escalators and elevators that circulate people along the face of the building are all held up by 122 structural trusses .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA working with Bentley and MicroStation ,COMMA we've written a custom piece of software that networks all of the components together into these chunks of information ,COMMA so that if we change any element along the length of the building ,COMMA not only does that change distribute through each one of the trusses ,COMMA but each one of the trusses then distributes that information down the length of the entire facade of the building .PERIOD <BREAK>
But what it gives us is a harmonic and synthesized relationship of all these components ,COMMA one to another .PERIOD <BREAK>
At the same time ,COMMA there's a person paying 30000 dollars for a 300 -series car ,COMMA and a person paying 70000 dollars for a 700 series ,COMMA and that person paying more than double doesn't want their car to look too much like the bottom-of-the-market car .PERIOD <BREAK>
So they have to also discriminate between these products .PERIOD <BREAK>
To go back to architecture ,COMMA what's organic about architecture as a field ,COMMA unlike product design ,COMMA is this whole issue of holism and of monumentality is really our realm .PERIOD <BREAK>
And to do that ,COMMA we tried to connect up the five towers into a single system .PERIOD <BREAK>
With United Architects ,COMMA also ,COMMA we made a proposal for the European Central Bank headquarters that used the same system ,COMMA but this time in a much more monolithic mass ,COMMA like a sphere .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA for these interiors ,COMMA like this shop in Stockholm ,COMMA Sweden ,COMMA or this installation wall in the Netherlands at the Netherlands Architecture Institute ,COMMA we could use the texture that the tool would leave to produce a lot of the spatial effects ,COMMA and we could integrate the texture of the wall with the form of the wall with the material .PERIOD <BREAK>
What I'd like to do is just drag us all down into the gutter ,COMMA and actually all the way down into the sewer because I want to talk about diarrhea .PERIOD <BREAK>
And in particular ,COMMA I want to talk about the design of diarrhea .PERIOD <BREAK>
If instead transmission to another host requires host mobility ,COMMA then we expect that the winners of the competition will be the milder organisms .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA one way you can test is just look at all diarrheal bacteria ,COMMA and see whether or not the ones that tend to be more transmitted by water ,COMMA tend to be more harmful .PERIOD <BREAK>
After a few days of infection you end up having -- the fecal material really isn't so disgusting as we might imagine .PERIOD <BREAK>
And if you took a drop of that water ,COMMA you might find a million diarrheal organisms .PERIOD <BREAK>
If it didn't produce a lot of this toxin ,COMMA then you might find a smaller number .PERIOD <BREAK>
So the task is to try to figure out how to determine whether or not you could get an organism like this to evolve towards mildness by blocking waterborne transmission ,COMMA thereby allowing the organism only to be transmitted by person-to-person contact ,COMMA or person-food-person contact -- both of which would really require that people be mobile and fairly healthy for transmission .PERIOD <BREAK>
One would be to take a lot of different strains of this organism -- some that produce a lot of toxins ,COMMA some that produce a little -- and take those strains and spew them out in different countries .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA we don't want to run an experiment like that .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA I don't know how that happened ,COMMA and I didn't have anything to do with it ,COMMA I promise you .PERIOD <BREAK>
The goal is to turn this around .PERIOD <BREAK>
If you could cause an evolutionary decrease in virulence by cleaning up the water supply ,COMMA you should be able to get an evolutionary decrease in antibiotic resistance .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I want to give you just one more example ,COMMA because we've talked a little bit about malaria .PERIOD <BREAK>
In the case of malaria ,COMMA what we'd like to do is mosquito-proof houses .PERIOD <BREAK>
The only pathogens that get transmitted are the ones that are infecting people that feel healthy enough to walk outside and get mosquito bites .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA I don't really have time to talk about those things ,COMMA but I did want to put them up there ,COMMA just to give you a sense that there really are solutions to controlling the evolution of harmfulness of some of the nasty pathogens that we're confronted with .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the data really do support this :COLON that you actually do get the virus evolving towards mildness .PERIOD <BREAK>
Anyhow ,COMMA I'll end that there ,COMMA and thank you very much .PERIOD <BREAK>
Our hands are amazing instruments .PERIOD <BREAK>
And when they're missing ,COMMA it's a barrier .PERIOD <BREAK>
Every time you contract a muscle ,COMMA it emits a little electricity that you can record with antennae or electrodes and use that to operate the motorized prosthesis .PERIOD <BREAK>
Well the body works by starting a motor command in your brain ,COMMA going down your spinal cord ,COMMA out the nerves and to your periphery .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we take the nerve away from your chest muscle and let these nerves grow into it .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now you think ,COMMA Close hand ,COMMA and a little section of your chest contracts .PERIOD <BREAK>
And Jesse's a good crane operator ,COMMA and he did okay by our standards .PERIOD <BREAK>
So this is really exciting for us ,COMMA because now we have a portal ,COMMA a portal ,COMMA or a way to potentially give back sensation ,COMMA so that he might feel what he touches with his prosthetic hand .PERIOD <BREAK>
We've also gone on with what was initially our primary population of people with above-the-elbow amputations .PERIOD <BREAK>
You had to concentrate a whole lot .PERIOD <BREAK>
Then we fit her with a prosthesis .PERIOD <BREAK>
A little faster .PERIOD And much more easy ,COMMA much more natural .PERIOD <BREAK>
There's a lot of information in those nerve signals ,COMMA and we wanted to get more .PERIOD <BREAK>
And here you can see ,COMMA on Jesse's chest ,COMMA when he just tried to do three different things ,COMMA you can see three different patterns .PERIOD <BREAK>
Obviously ,COMMA that's heavy for Amanda .PERIOD <BREAK>
It took just about probably three to four hours to get it to train .PERIOD <BREAK>
So we're really excited ,COMMA because now we're getting to a clinically practical device .PERIOD <BREAK>
I want you to watch closely .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's Claudia ,COMMA and that was the first time she got to feel sensation through her prosthetic .PERIOD <BREAK>
Once we can do it that small ,COMMA it's a lot easier making them bigger .PERIOD <BREAK>
So Amanda came jet-lagged ,COMMA she's using the arm ,COMMA and everything goes wrong .PERIOD <BREAK>
And none of those problems could I have dealt with ,COMMA but I have a really bright research team .PERIOD <BREAK>
But first ,COMMA I want to start by saying that we need a new operating system ,COMMA for the oceans and for the Earth .PERIOD <BREAK>
Because we've only doubled the population of the Earth since the 1960 s -- a little more than doubled -- but we have 67 billion people in the world ,COMMA and we all like to consume .PERIOD <BREAK>
Humans ,COMMA without fins :COLON 90 meters ,COMMA 35 minutes .PERIOD <BREAK>
So penguins are amazing athletes .PERIOD <BREAK>
And ,COMMA more importantly ,COMMA they're well-dressed .PERIOD <BREAK>
If you go and do it now ,COMMA the national parks count about 500 .PERIOD <BREAK>
So we have a quarter of the penguins that we did 40 years ago .PERIOD <BREAK>
When we have extreme El Nino events ,COMMA you see all this red ,COMMA and you see no green out here around the Galapagos .PERIOD <BREAK>
things die when there's no food .PERIOD <BREAK>
And if you look along the coast of Argentina ,COMMA where I work now ,COMMA at a place called Punta Tombo -- the largest Magellanic penguin colony in the world down here about 44 degrees south latitude -- you see that there's great variation here .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so we have started a global penguin society to try to focus on the real plight of penguins .PERIOD <BREAK>
They ended up swimming through ballast water that had oil in it .PERIOD <BREAK>
So we ended up spending nine years convincing the government that there were lots of oiled penguins .PERIOD <BREAK>
And ,COMMA of course ,COMMA all of this then leads to a vicious cycle and you can't raise a lot of chicks .PERIOD <BREAK>
Turbo has taken to knocking on the door with his beak ,COMMA we let him in and he comes in here .PERIOD <BREAK>
So this is Turbo .PERIOD <BREAK>
And now he's looking at the other guy ,COMMA saying ,COMMA You are really weird .PERIOD <BREAK>
Most important thing is :COLON Only you can change yourself ,COMMA and only you can change the world and make it better ,COMMA for people as well as penguins .PERIOD <BREAK>
But let's talk about the 90 percent of the world population that will never leave the place in which they were born .PERIOD <BREAK>
Over 50 new countries were born .PERIOD <BREAK>
And they share a lengthy land border .PERIOD <BREAK>
In fact ,COMMA the World Bank predicts that Russia's population is declining towards about 120 million people And there is another thing that you don't see on this map .PERIOD <BREAK>
Stalin ,COMMA Khrushchev and other Soviet leaders forced Russians out to the far east to be in gulags ,COMMA labor camps ,COMMA nuclear cities ,COMMA whatever the case was .PERIOD <BREAK>
As a result ,COMMA in the Russian far east today ,COMMA which is twice the size of India ,COMMA you have exactly six million Russians .PERIOD <BREAK>
Because globalization opens up all kinds of ways for us to undermine and change the way we think about political geography .PERIOD <BREAK>
Remember the 40 dots on the nighttime map that show the hubs of the global economy ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And now many of you have been reading in the news how people are looking to China to lead the rebound ,COMMA the economic rebound ,COMMA not just in Asia ,COMMA but potentially for the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
So China is becoming the anchor of the economy in the region .PERIOD <BREAK>
China has signed military agreements with many countries in the region .PERIOD <BREAK>
All of this is happening without firing a shot .PERIOD <BREAK>
So what can we do to think about borders differently in this part of the world ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
What I want to present to you is what I call state building ,COMMA day by day .PERIOD <BREAK>
The Kurds for 3000 years have been waging a struggle for independence ,COMMA and now is their chance to finally have it .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now remember Kurdistan is landlocked .PERIOD <BREAK>
And therefore it has to have amicable relations with them .PERIOD <BREAK>
The lesson from Kurdistan and from Palestine is that independence alone ,COMMA without infrastructure ,COMMA is futile .PERIOD <BREAK>
The last time that was the case was actually a century ago ,COMMA during the Ottoman Empire .PERIOD <BREAK>
But today the Hejaz Railway lies in tatters ,COMMA ruins .PERIOD <BREAK>
More pipelines means more silk roads ,COMMA instead of the Great Game .PERIOD <BREAK>
In 2004 ,COMMA 15 new countries joined the EU .PERIOD <BREAK>
Even if these regions aren't part of the EU ,COMMA they are becoming part of its sphere of influence .PERIOD <BREAK>
So what's next ?QUESTIONMARK Where are we going to see borders change and new countries born ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
If we were to look at all of Africa we could most certainly acknowledge far more ,COMMA tribal divisions and so forth .PERIOD <BREAK>
It has three ongoing civil wars ,COMMA the genocide in Darfur ,COMMA which you all know about ,COMMA the civil war in the east of the country ,COMMA and south Sudan .PERIOD <BREAK>
But if you look in nature ,COMMA you see that different kinds of animals can have really different lifespans .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now these animals are different from one another ,COMMA because they have different genes .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we didn't study any of these animals .PERIOD <BREAK>
Is it miserable ?QUESTIONMARK It doesn't seem to be .PERIOD <BREAK>
And if you look at the tissues of the animal ,COMMA they're starting to deteriorate .PERIOD <BREAK>
And now here is the daf- 2 mutant .PERIOD <BREAK>
But it's really more like this :COLON let's say you're a 30 year-old guy -- or in your 30 s -- and you're a bachelor and you're dating people .PERIOD <BREAK>
She says ,COMMA I'm 60 .PERIOD <BREAK>
Well as you know ,COMMA genes ,COMMA which are part of the DNA ,COMMA they're instructions to make a protein that does something .PERIOD <BREAK>
It says that aging is subject to control by the genes ,COMMA and specifically by hormones .PERIOD <BREAK>
So after we made our discoveries with little C .PERIOD elegans ,COMMA people who worked on other kinds of animals started asking ,COMMA if we made the same daf- 2 mutation ,COMMA the hormone receptor mutation ,COMMA in other animals ,COMMA will they live longer ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
They hardly get cancer ,COMMA and when they do it's not as severe .PERIOD <BREAK>
So in a daf- 2 mutant -- you see that I have the X drawn here through the receptor .PERIOD <BREAK>
The receptor isn't working as well .PERIOD <BREAK>
And many of these different genes ,COMMA we've shown ,COMMA actually contribute to the long lifespan of the daf- 2 mutant .PERIOD <BREAK>
Then they promote the uptake of nutrients .PERIOD <BREAK>
So he doesn't actually do anything himself .PERIOD <BREAK>
We don't know the details of how this works ,COMMA but we do know then that FOXO genes can impact the lifespan of people .PERIOD <BREAK>
But in this case ,COMMA there's already a drug called rapamycin that binds to the TOR protein and inhibits its activity .PERIOD <BREAK>
So people take it to prevent organ transplants from being rejected .PERIOD <BREAK>
You could change the genes in principle .PERIOD <BREAK>
So it might be that you would just have to fine tune it very carefully to get the benefits without getting any problems .PERIOD <BREAK>
I wasn't suggesting that I was going to go and do it ,COMMA but .PERIOD <BREAK>
Just move to one side for us ,COMMA if you would .PERIOD <BREAK>
And when you look at these 70 year-old turtles ,COMMA you can't tell the difference ,COMMA just by looking ,COMMA between those turtles and 20 year-old turtles .PERIOD <BREAK>
They're more resistant to these kinds of stresses .PERIOD <BREAK>
They're not getting old in the dog's lifespan .PERIOD <BREAK>
Here's another good article about a new campaign opposing privatization of transit without any contact information for the campaign .PERIOD <BREAK>
The message seems to be that the readers are most likely to want to eat ,COMMA maybe read a book ,COMMA maybe see a movie ,COMMA but not be engaged in their community .PERIOD <BREAK>
They all have heroes who were chosen .PERIOD <BREAK>
This helps me understand why a lot of people have trouble seeing themselves as leaders because it sends all the wrong messages about what leadership is about .PERIOD <BREAK>
As long as we're teaching our kids that heroism starts when someone scratches a mark on your forehead ,COMMA or someone tells you that you're part of a prophecy ,COMMA they're missing the most important characteristic of leadership ,COMMA which is that it comes from within .PERIOD <BREAK>
Which leads us to the last one ,COMMA which is our elections .PERIOD <BREAK>
So I was privileged to train in transplantation under two great surgical pioneers :COLON Thomas Starzl ,COMMA who performed the world's first successful liver transplant in 1967 ,COMMA and Sir Roy Calne ,COMMA who performed the first liver transplant in the UK .PERIOD <BREAK>
in the following year .PERIOD <BREAK>
But not all patients on the transplant wait list are so fortunate .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the gift of life has been extended from brain-dead donors to living ,COMMA related donors -- relatives who might donate an organ or a part of an organ ,COMMA like a split liver graft ,COMMA to a relative or loved one .PERIOD <BREAK>
No doubt ,COMMA I was informed ,COMMA the consent had been obtained .PERIOD <BREAK>
And at that time ,COMMA stem cell research had gained momentum ,COMMA following the isolation of the world's first human embryonic stem cells in the 1990 s .PERIOD <BREAK>
And as it turns out ,COMMA fat is one of the best sources of adult stem cells .PERIOD <BREAK>
If this research is successful ,COMMA it may then reduce the need to research and sacrifice human embryos .PERIOD <BREAK>
It is a fact that when our organs or tissues are injured ,COMMA our bone marrow releases stem cells into our circulation .PERIOD <BREAK>
There are 170 clinical trials investigating the role of stem cells in heart disease .PERIOD <BREAK>
We are very happy because we have the opportunity to have this angel in the world -- not only in our country ,COMMA Venezuela ,COMMA but in our world .PERIOD <BREAK>
He has given us the possibility to have dreams and to make true the dreams .PERIOD <BREAK>
And here are the results of this wonderful project that is The System in Venezuela .PERIOD <BREAK>
He buys a ring ,COMMA she buys a dress .PERIOD <BREAK>
These optimistic young bastards promise to honor and cherish each other through hot flashes and mid-life crises and a cumulative 50 -lb .PERIOD weight gain ,COMMA until that far-off day when one of them is finally able to rest in peace .PERIOD <BREAK>
And some of them will even still be enjoying each others' company when neither of them can chew solid food anymore .PERIOD <BREAK>
What do the folks who make it all the way to side-by-side burial plots have in common ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And they try to pinpoint what it is that sets them apart from their miserable neighbors and friends .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's obvious that this leads to marital bliss because ,COMMA women ,COMMA we care a great deal about being thin and good looking ,COMMA whereas men mostly care about sex .PERIOD <BREAK>
So instead of all that laborious dieting and exercising ,COMMA we just need to wait for them to get fat ,COMMA maybe bake a few pies .PERIOD <BREAK>
These are couples who can find good in any situation .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is an actual study ,COMMA and let me clarify .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now I don't know how old all of you are ,COMMA but when I was a kid ,COMMA your parents took pictures with a special kind of camera that held something called film ,COMMA and ,COMMA by God ,COMMA film was expensive .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'm serious .PERIOD <BREAK>
So I'm obviously going to need fatten him up .PERIOD <BREAK>
I have a doppelganger .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's exactly what I do -- optical mind control .PERIOD <BREAK>
Even if we could measure what every cell is doing at all times ,COMMA we would still have to make sense of the recorded activity patterns ,COMMA and that's so difficult ,COMMA chances are we'll understand these patterns just as little as the brains that produce them .PERIOD <BREAK>
To make progress ,COMMA we need to break the code .PERIOD <BREAK>
The approach works so well that we can write purely artificial messages directly to the brain .PERIOD <BREAK>
These headless bodies can live for about a day ,COMMA but they don't do much .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now for an intelligent being like our fly ,COMMA this policy is not written in stone but rather changes as the animal learns from experience .PERIOD <BREAK>
So we bred flies whose brains were more or less randomly peppered with cells that were light addressable .PERIOD <BREAK>
Whenever it comes up to the midpoint ,COMMA it pauses ,COMMA it carefully scans the odor interface as if it was sniffing out its environment ,COMMA and then it turns around .PERIOD <BREAK>
These 12 cells ,COMMA as shown here in green ,COMMA send the output to a brain structure called the mushroom body ,COMMA which is shown here in gray .PERIOD <BREAK>
If the connection is strong ,COMMA the motors will turn on and the fly will initiate a turn .PERIOD <BREAK>
In a situation like this ,COMMA we would expect the Critic to speak up and to tell the Actor to change its policy .PERIOD <BREAK>
So the next time the fly finds itself facing the same odor again ,COMMA the connection is strong enough to turn on the motors and to trigger an evasive maneuver .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA in terms of biomimetics ,COMMA as human technologies take on more of the characteristics of nature ,COMMA nature becomes a much more useful teacher .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA being a biologist ,COMMA I was very curious about this .PERIOD <BREAK>
These are gecko toes .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the individual has 2 billion of these nano-size split ends .PERIOD <BREAK>
So what they did was they asked us an important question .PERIOD <BREAK>
They're climbing up a wall ,COMMA or a tree .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now that's real time .PERIOD You can't see anything .PERIOD <BREAK>
So they do it with this active tail as they swing around .PERIOD <BREAK>
Okay ,COMMA there it goes .PERIOD <BREAK>
It oscillates its tail up and down like a dolphin .PERIOD <BREAK>
But watch its front legs .PERIOD Can you see what they are doing ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
So now we were really confused ,COMMA because there are no reports of it gliding .PERIOD <BREAK>
One of the problems is coming up with the right target .PERIOD <BREAK>
There's not a lot of science behind that one either .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA why is this so complicated ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Volcanoes eject aerosols into the atmosphere .PERIOD <BREAK>
So here's the thing .PERIOD It sounds like a simple question .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's the Ross Sea Ice Shelf on the right there .PERIOD <BREAK>
You can go then and study corals and figure out how often do you see this .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it been growing for about 600 years .PERIOD <BREAK>
You can see some of the coral cores there on the right .PERIOD <BREAK>
That the place where ,COMMA during an earthquake in 1954 ,COMMA this marine terrace was lifted up out of the ocean very quickly ,COMMA and it was lifted up about six to seven meters .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so now you can walk through a coral reef without getting wet .PERIOD <BREAK>
There's a whole family of curves here .PERIOD <BREAK>
Some of the records show lower temperatures than others .PERIOD <BREAK>
And there is natural variability caused by the Sun ,COMMA caused by El Ninos .PERIOD <BREAK>
There's consequences for carbonate organisms .PERIOD <BREAK>
The main framework material of coral reefs is calcium carbonate .PERIOD <BREAK>
And on coral reefs ,COMMA where some of the main framework organisms disappear ,COMMA we will see a major loss of marine biodiversity .PERIOD <BREAK>
You know ,COMMA these are things that we have good physiological reasons to expect to see stressed caused by this transience .PERIOD <BREAK>
You have to go back about 30 million years to find a time when CO 2 levels were double what they are today .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's the reason that they're not able to respond or adapt to this rapid acidification that's going on right now .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I think that may very well be true ,COMMA so I'll close with this .PERIOD <BREAK>
And a long time ago -- well ,COMMA about 40 years ago -- my mom had an exchange student .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is Donna at the Statue of Liberty .PERIOD <BREAK>
But I'd like to talk about another way to travel that doesn't require a ship or an airplane ,COMMA and just requires a movie camera ,COMMA a projector and a screen .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that's what I'm going to talk to you about today .PERIOD <BREAK>
So I'm the living product of two cultures coming together .PERIOD <BREAK>
To change the Arab nightmare into the American dream .PERIOD <BREAK>
Josh Rushing :COLON The night they showed the POWs and the dead soldiers -- Al Jazeera showed them -- it was powerful because America doesn't show those kinds of images .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it upset me on a profound level that I wasn't bothered as much the night before .PERIOD <BREAK>
Jehane Noujaim :COLON I was overwhelmed by the response of the film ,COMMA for we didn't know whether it would be able to get out there .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I saw this with audiences .PERIOD <BREAK>
Man :COLON God forbid !EXCLAMATIONMARK <BREAK>
If you were not Abu Azzam's daughter .PERIOD <BREAK>
In this life ,COMMA we're dead anyway .PERIOD <BREAK>
Woman :COLON Perhaps .PERIOD We have to turn it into a moral war .PERIOD <BREAK>
Zvika :COLON I said ,COMMA OK ,COMMA that's Bat-Chen ,COMMA that's my daughter .PERIOD <BREAK>
Are you sure she is dead ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
When we got to here ,COMMA we saw three Israeli military jeeps parked on the side of the road .PERIOD <BREAK>
George :COLON But there is a teacher that is in charge ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
But after thinking logically about it ,COMMA I didn't find any reason why not to meet them and let them know of our suffering .PERIOD <BREAK>
We see that there are Palestinians who suffered a lot ,COMMA who lost children ,COMMA and still believe in the peace process and in reconciliation .PERIOD <BREAK>
Yes .PERIOD Yes !EXCLAMATIONMARK <BREAK>
But I've been trying to think about ways to give power to these independent voices ,COMMA to give power to the filmmakers ,COMMA to give power to people who are trying to use film for change .PERIOD <BREAK>
There's Just Vision ,COMMA that are working with Palestinians and Israelis who are working together for peace ,COMMA and documenting that process and getting interviews out there and using this film to take to Congress to show that it's a powerful tool to show that this is a woman who's had her daughter killed in an attack ,COMMA and she believes that there are peaceful ways to solve this .PERIOD <BREAK>
There's Working Films and there's Current TV ,COMMA which is an incredible platform for people around the world to be able to put their -- yes ,COMMA it's amazing .PERIOD <BREAK>
There are people that want to be a part of this global day of film ,COMMA to be able to provide a platform for independent voices and independent films to get out there .PERIOD <BREAK>
In the year 1919 ,COMMA a virtually unknown German mathematician ,COMMA named Theodor Kaluza suggested a very bold and ,COMMA in some ways ,COMMA a very bizarre idea .PERIOD <BREAK>
That is in addition to left ,COMMA right ,COMMA back ,COMMA forth and up ,COMMA down ,COMMA Kaluza proposed that there might be additional dimensions of space that for some reason we don't yet see .PERIOD <BREAK>
How is it that the Sun ,COMMA 93 million miles away ,COMMA [that] somehow it affects the motion of the Earth ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
He ,COMMA like Einstein ,COMMA was in search of what we call a unified theory .PERIOD <BREAK>
Maybe I can play the same game with the other known force ,COMMA which was ,COMMA at that time ,COMMA known as the electromagnetic force -- we know of others today ,COMMA but at that time that was the only other one people were thinking about .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA but for those of us who are a little bit more practically minded ,COMMA two questions immediately arise from his observation .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's very hard to see it ,COMMA though ,COMMA from far away .PERIOD <BREAK>
So many people worked on it ,COMMA but by the ' 40 s ,COMMA certainly by the ' 50 s ,COMMA this strange but very compelling idea of how to unify the laws of physics had gone away .PERIOD <BREAK>
In our era ,COMMA a new approach to unify the laws of physics is being pursued by physicists such as myself ,COMMA many others around the world ,COMMA it's called superstring theory ,COMMA as you were indicating .PERIOD <BREAK>
And there you see unification ,COMMA because matter particles ,COMMA electrons and quarks ,COMMA radiation particles ,COMMA photons ,COMMA gravitons ,COMMA are all built up from one entity .PERIOD <BREAK>
One of the other predictions of string theory -- no ,COMMA that's not one of the other predictions of string theory .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that question is this :COLON when we look around the world ,COMMA as scientists have done for the last hundred years ,COMMA there appear to be about 20 numbers that really describe our universe .PERIOD <BREAK>
Not yet .PERIOD <BREAK>
But we believe the answer for why those numbers have the values they do may rely on the form of the extra dimensions .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is an example of something known as a Calabi-Yau shape -- name isn't all that important .PERIOD <BREAK>
But ,COMMA as you can see ,COMMA the extra dimensions fold in on themselves and intertwine in a very interesting shape ,COMMA interesting structure .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the idea is that if this is what the extra dimensions look like ,COMMA then the microscopic landscape of our universe all around us would look like this on the tiniest of scales .PERIOD <BREAK>
And this is an experiment that may test for them in our lifetime .PERIOD <BREAK>
And yet ,COMMA even at this most fundamental level ,COMMA context is everything .PERIOD <BREAK>
And now you see it .PERIOD <BREAK>
There is no a priori reason why an H has to go between that W and A .PERIOD <BREAK>
So you don't do it again .PERIOD <BREAK>
Your brain is learning .PERIOD And it's learning that the right side of its visual field is under red illumination ;SEMICOLON the left side of its visual field is under green illumination .PERIOD <BREAK>
I take it from your response they don't look the same anymore .PERIOD Right ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Why ?QUESTIONMARK Because if the tile in that shadow were in fact in shadow ,COMMA and reflecting the same amount of light to your eye as the one outside the shadow ,COMMA it would have to be more reflective -- just the laws of physics .PERIOD <BREAK>
Which means we can bring all this information together to create some incredibly strong illusions .PERIOD <BREAK>
And they land on the flower .PERIOD They stick their tongue in there ,COMMA called a proboscis ,COMMA and they drink sugar water .PERIOD <BREAK>
So they are using the relationships between the colors to solve the puzzle ,COMMA which is exactly what we do .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA illusions are often used ,COMMA especially in art ,COMMA in the words of a more contemporary artist ,COMMA to demonstrate the fragility of our senses .PERIOD <BREAK>
Instead ,COMMA color tells us something completely different ,COMMA that the brain didn't actually evolve to see the world the way it is .PERIOD <BREAK>
We can't .PERIOD Instead ,COMMA the brain evolved to see the world the way it was useful to see in the past .PERIOD <BREAK>
Well ,COMMA one of the ways we do in my lab and studio is we translate the light into sound and we enable people to hear their visual world .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA working with kids ,COMMA they created images ,COMMA thinking about what might the images you see sound like if we could listen to them .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA now ,COMMA what I want to do :COLON I'm going to put the middle nine surfaces here under yellow illumination by simply putting a filter behind them .PERIOD <BREAK>
The question is ,COMMA Is that an illusion ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And they're different .PERIOD <BREAK>
And you can make your own decision ,COMMA and then you'll decide whether the invasion was worth it .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's how you think about security -- in terms of the trade-off .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'll give you the short answer .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now most of the time ,COMMA that works .PERIOD <BREAK>
We've developed this ability because it makes evolutionary sense .PERIOD <BREAK>
The unknown is perceived to be riskier than the familiar .PERIOD <BREAK>
If you hear a lot about tiger attacks ,COMMA there must be a lot of tigers around .PERIOD <BREAK>
When something is so common ,COMMA it's no longer news -- car crashes ,COMMA domestic violence -- those are the risks you worry about .PERIOD <BREAK>
There's no real word for stuff that makes us secure ,COMMA but doesn't make us feel secure .PERIOD <BREAK>
And there are two ways to do this .PERIOD <BREAK>
Enough real world examples helps .PERIOD <BREAK>
Security theater's exposed when it's obvious that it's not working properly .PERIOD <BREAK>
If ,COMMA for example ,COMMA terrorism almost never happens ,COMMA it's really hard to judge the efficacy of counter-terrorist measures .PERIOD <BREAK>
It doesn't change ;SEMICOLON it's real .PERIOD <BREAK>
We couldn't have a germ theory of disease before we invented the microscope to see them .PERIOD <BREAK>
Where do we get these models ?QUESTIONMARK We get them from others .PERIOD <BREAK>
Think of models of terrorism ,COMMA child kidnapping ,COMMA airline safety ,COMMA car safety .PERIOD <BREAK>
Models can come from industry .PERIOD <BREAK>
For us ,COMMA we're very facile around electricity .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now it had a name ,COMMA which made it scarier than the regular flu ,COMMA even though it was more deadly .PERIOD <BREAK>
As the novelty wore off ,COMMA the months went by ,COMMA there was some amount of tolerance ,COMMA people got used to it .PERIOD <BREAK>
We have feeling ,COMMA model ,COMMA reality .PERIOD <BREAK>
New models that extend long periods of time are hard .PERIOD <BREAK>
Global warming is a great example .PERIOD <BREAK>
Strong feelings can create a model .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that's okay .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA what we want is people to get familiar enough with better models -- have it reflected in their feelings -- to allow them to make security trade-offs .PERIOD <BREAK>
Remember I said feeling ,COMMA model ,COMMA reality ;SEMICOLON I said reality doesn't change .PERIOD It actually does .PERIOD <BREAK>
Someone else bought it and died .PERIOD <BREAK>
All human life ,COMMA all life ,COMMA depends on plants .PERIOD <BREAK>
And plants sometimes find it rather difficult to move because there might be cities and other things in the way .PERIOD <BREAK>
So if all human life depends on plants ,COMMA doesn't it make sense that perhaps we should try to save them ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
All the genetic information for future generations of plants are held in seeds .PERIOD <BREAK>
So all around the world people are doing the same thing .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is at least 100 times bigger .PERIOD <BREAK>
How much does it cost ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
The future research is How can we find the genetic and molecular markers for the viability of seeds ,COMMA without having to plant them every 10 years ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And it was found close to here ,COMMA Stanford .PERIOD <BREAK>
Some lasted 14 -and-a-half minutes .PERIOD <BREAK>
Couldn't do it .PERIOD Could not wait .PERIOD <BREAK>
Put it back .PERIOD <BREAK>
They would walk around .PERIOD They would play with their skirts and pants .PERIOD <BREAK>
The sales person that -- the customer says ,COMMA I want that .PERIOD And the person says ,COMMA Okay ,COMMA here you are .PERIOD <BREAK>
Then you sell a lot more .PERIOD <BREAK>
The rules of engagement :COLON how to talk ,COMMA when to talk ,COMMA and how to deal with them .PERIOD <BREAK>
We just have to persevere .PERIOD <BREAK>
Everybody seems to agree with that .PERIOD <BREAK>
But now ,COMMA as we prepare to talk ,COMMA we understand how little we know .PERIOD <BREAK>
Should we talk to Hamas ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Now my diplomats are instructed to talk to all these groups .PERIOD <BREAK>
But talking can be done in different ways .PERIOD <BREAK>
We make a distinction between talking from a diplomatic level and talking at the political level .PERIOD <BREAK>
In his memoirs ,COMMA Long Road to Freedom ,COMMA he wrote that he survived during those years of captivity because he always decided to look upon his oppressor as also being a human being ,COMMA also being a human being .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now South African friends will know that was very painful .PERIOD <BREAK>
Dialogue is not easy -- not between individuals ,COMMA not between groups ,COMMA not between governments -- but it is very necessary .PERIOD <BREAK>
But that strategy seldom takes you very far .PERIOD <BREAK>
We could never have done the convention against anti-personnel landmines and the convention that is banning cluster munitions unless we had done diplomacy differently ,COMMA by engaging with civil society .PERIOD <BREAK>
How are we going to solve climate change through negotiations ,COMMA unless we are able to make civil society and people ,COMMA not part of the problem ,COMMA but part of the solution ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
What is the legitimacy of diplomacy ,COMMA of the the solution we devise as diplomats if they cannot be reflected and understood by also these broader forces of societies that we now very loosely call groups ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
The diplomatic toolbox is actually full of different tools we can use to strengthen our communication .PERIOD <BREAK>
In my country ,COMMA I have seen how the council of Islamist groups and Christian groups came together ,COMMA not as a government initiative ,COMMA but they came together on their own initiative to establish contact and dialogue in times where things were pretty low-key tension .PERIOD <BREAK>
How are we going to settle and build a bigger We to deal with our issues if we don't improve our skills of communication ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
So ,COMMA I'm in Chile ,COMMA in the Atacama desert ,COMMA sitting in a hotel lobby ,COMMA because that's the only place that I can get a Wi-Fi connection ,COMMA and I have this picture up on my screen ,COMMA and a woman comes up behind me .PERIOD <BREAK>
And ,COMMA you know ,COMMA Excuse me !EXCLAMATIONMARK <BREAK>
This is a Gentoo penguin .PERIOD And she was still skeptical .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA one of the things that I love to do is travel around the world and look at archaeological sites .PERIOD <BREAK>
And ,COMMA one thing that isn't a mystery ,COMMA actually ,COMMA was when I grew up -- because when I was a little kid ,COMMA I'd seen these pictures -- and I thought ,COMMA Well ,COMMA why that look on the face ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
In fact ,COMMA in many of the statues ,COMMA when you excavate them ,COMMA the backs are totally smooth -- almost glass smooth .PERIOD <BREAK>
We're trying to get all of the permissions to get everything all set ,COMMA to get it going .PERIOD <BREAK>
In this case ,COMMA we're working with a major medical foundation to develop inexpensive ways of diagnosing diseases in developing countries .PERIOD <BREAK>
Various parts of the world will have a cult food that people get enormously attached to -- there's tremendous traditions ,COMMA there's secrecy .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I'm trying to use a very scientific approach .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA I do a lot of work on dinosaurs .PERIOD <BREAK>
Not the same one ,COMMA actually .PERIOD This is a cast ,COMMA which I had bought ,COMMA and then ,COMMA after buying the cast ,COMMA I found my own ,COMMA and I don't have room for two .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's something that can inform all sorts of science in unexpected ways .PERIOD <BREAK>
These days ,COMMA bits are cheap .PERIOD Unfortunately ,COMMA that means you've got to spend more time sorting through them .PERIOD <BREAK>
Then ,COMMA a little bit later ,COMMA I start getting some pictures like this .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's kind of what it's like .PERIOD <BREAK>
And you know ,COMMA when I was at Microsoft ,COMMA that was so engrossing ,COMMA and the whole industry was expanding so much ,COMMA that it did tend to crowd out most of the other things in my life .PERIOD <BREAK>
The sound made flicking a wall switch off is of a completely different nature .PERIOD <BREAK>
Or the recorded crowing of a rooster ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
That's the end of that .PERIOD <BREAK>
Take-out sandwich shops ,COMMA film processing drop-offs ,COMMA peep-shows and necktie stores .PERIOD <BREAK>
You were late for school again this morning .PERIOD <BREAK>
We have fading memories of that provisional temple ,COMMA erected each time an adult sat down .PERIOD <BREAK>
The next story is called The Haverpiece Collection A nondescript warehouse ,COMMA visible for a moment from the northbound lanes of the Prykushko Expressway ,COMMA serves as the temporary resting place for the Haverpiece collection of European dried fruit .PERIOD <BREAK>
Do you remember wandering as a child through those dark wooden storefront galleries ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
A shoe made of apricot leather for the daughter of a czar .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that this ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA will be the way that we treat cancer in the future .PERIOD <BREAK>
It is very useful in certain circumstances .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's the one theory that the biologists ever really got right .PERIOD <BREAK>
You predict a black hole ,COMMA and you look out the telescope and there it is ,COMMA just like you said .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so we can discover things that probably you could have found by looking at enough of your relatives ,COMMA but they may be surprising .PERIOD <BREAK>
And Applied Minds gets a lot of calls from people who want help with their problems ,COMMA and I didn't think this was a very likely one to call back ,COMMA so I kept on giving him to the delay list .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I'll show you what that protein measurement looks like .PERIOD <BREAK>
We sort out the proteins -- from left to right is the weight of the fragments that we're getting ,COMMA and from top to bottom is how slippery they are .PERIOD <BREAK>
And you can see how the lines occur in these little groups of bump ,COMMA bump ,COMMA bump ,COMMA bump ,COMMA bump .PERIOD <BREAK>
And many people in this audience probably wouldn't be alive if doctors didn't do this .PERIOD <BREAK>
Well ,COMMA it's in the kitchen .PERIOD Oh ,COMMA you must have kitchen water .PERIOD <BREAK>
So your house is dealing with leaks all the time ,COMMA but it's fixing them .PERIOD It's draining them out and so on .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so I gave this talk and said ,COMMA Why don't you guys do this ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
But design a program of treatments specifically for you and help your body guide back to health -- guide your body back to health .PERIOD <BREAK>
So thank you very much .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA I want to tell you a quick story .PERIOD <BREAK>
Super Bowl .PERIOD I heard it over here .PERIOD It was the date of the Super Bowl .PERIOD <BREAK>
And there were even some polls that were saying she was going to go all the way .PERIOD <BREAK>
But when we talked to people ,COMMA it appeared that a funnel effect had happened in these tribes all across the United States .PERIOD <BREAK>
But not just work .PERIOD It's within these tribes that societies get built ,COMMA that important things happen .PERIOD <BREAK>
If you focus in on a group like this -- this happens to be a USC game -- and you zoom in with one of those super satellite cameras and do magnification factors so you could see individual people ,COMMA you would in fact see not a single crowd ,COMMA just like there is not a single crowd here ,COMMA but you would see these tribes that are then coming together .PERIOD <BREAK>
Not all tribes are the same ,COMMA and what makes the difference is the culture .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is the kid who shot up Virginia Tech .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA this other book that Steve mentioned ,COMMA that just came out ,COMMA called The Three Laws of Performance ,COMMA my colleague ,COMMA Steve Zaffron and I ,COMMA argue that as people see the world ,COMMA so they behave .PERIOD <BREAK>
Well ,COMMA if people see the world in such a way that life sucks ,COMMA then their behavior will follow automatically from that .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA my birthday is coming up shortly ,COMMA and my driver's license expires .PERIOD <BREAK>
The amount of world-changing behavior that would happen ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
A whole group of people communicating that way ,COMMA talking that way .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA we find these in places where really smart ,COMMA successful people show up .PERIOD <BREAK>
It was not Christmas time .PERIOD There was a Christmas tree .PERIOD <BREAK>
There is ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA another stage .PERIOD <BREAK>
There was no road map .PERIOD No one had ever done anything like this before .PERIOD <BREAK>
And people ,COMMA at the time ,COMMA feared that South Africa would end up going the way that Rwanda has gone ,COMMA descending into one skirmish after another in a civil war that seems to have no end .PERIOD <BREAK>
What about Martin Luther King ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
In fact ,COMMA Martin Luther King's most famous line was at Stage Three .PERIOD <BREAK>
48 percent of working tribes say ,COMMA these are employed tribes ,COMMA say ,COMMA I'm great and you're not .PERIOD <BREAK>
But you don't leave them where you found them .PERIOD Okay ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
I don't know anybody .PERIOD <BREAK>
We move people from Stage One to Stage Two by getting them in a new tribe and then ,COMMA over time ,COMMA getting them connected .PERIOD <BREAK>
But we're not done yet .PERIOD Because then how do we go from Stage Four ,COMMA which is great ,COMMA to Stage Five ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Incidentally ,COMMA they did pull it off .PERIOD <BREAK>
And they released the first-ever world poll .PERIOD <BREAK>
We're here to celebrate compassion .PERIOD <BREAK>
But kindness is an everyday byproduct of all the great virtues .PERIOD <BREAK>
And in that light ,COMMA for the religious ,COMMA compassion also brings us into the territory of mystery -- encouraging us not just to see beauty ,COMMA but perhaps also to look for the face of God in the moment of suffering ,COMMA in the face of a stranger ,COMMA in the face of the vibrant religious other .PERIOD <BREAK>
The communities that Jean Vanier founded ,COMMA like Jean Vanier himself ,COMMA exude tenderness .PERIOD <BREAK>
And compassion can also have those qualities .PERIOD <BREAK>
And compassion is unleashed in wider and wider circles by signs and stories ,COMMA never by statistics and strategies .PERIOD <BREAK>
Rachel Naomi Remen says this is an important and empowering story for our time ,COMMA because this story insists that each and every one of us ,COMMA frail and flawed as we may be ,COMMA inadequate as we may feel ,COMMA has exactly what's needed to help repair the part of the world that we can see and touch .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is going to change science ,COMMA I believe ,COMMA and it will change religion .PERIOD <BREAK>
Einstein believed deeply that science should transcend national and ethnic divisions .PERIOD <BREAK>
But he watched physicists and chemists become the purveyors of weapons of mass destruction in the early 20 th century .PERIOD <BREAK>
So in this photograph you see a mind looking out a window at what might be a cathedral -- it's not .PERIOD <BREAK>
Thank you .PERIOD <BREAK>
Camp was more like a keg party without any alcohol .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it went like this :COLON R-O-W-D-I-E ,COMMA that's the way we spell rowdie .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I just waited for the time that I could go off and read my books .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I was always going off to crowded bars when I really would have preferred to just have a nice dinner with friends .PERIOD <BREAK>
So even if you're an extrovert yourself ,COMMA I'm talking about your coworkers and your spouses and your children and the person sitting next to you right now -- all of them subject to this bias that is pretty deep and real in our society .PERIOD <BREAK>
Shyness is about fear of social judgment .PERIOD <BREAK>
So the key then to maximizing our talents is for us all to put ourselves in the zone of stimulation that is right for us .PERIOD <BREAK>
And also we have this belief system right now that I call the new groupthink ,COMMA which holds that all creativity and all productivity comes from a very oddly gregarious place .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the vast majority of teachers reports believing that the ideal student is an extrovert as opposed to an introvert ,COMMA even though introverts actually get better grades and are more knowledgeable ,COMMA according to research .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now I think at this point it's important for me to say that I actually love extroverts .PERIOD <BREAK>
The same religions who send their sages off to lonely mountain tops also teach us love and trust .PERIOD <BREAK>
Here's Margaret Atwood ,COMMA Cat's Eye .PERIOD <BREAK>
But here's the thing about my grandfather .PERIOD <BREAK>
It was my version of my grandfather's hours of the day alone in his library .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I call this my year of speaking dangerously .PERIOD <BREAK>
But we need much more privacy and much more freedom and much more autonomy at work .PERIOD <BREAK>
We need to be teaching kids to work together ,COMMA for sure ,COMMA but we also need to be teaching them how to work on their own .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that's okay .PERIOD <BREAK>
Then ,COMMA about the initiative that Chris mentioned ,COMMA that we decided to launch at AMD that we call 50 x 15 .PERIOD <BREAK>
He explained to me about Johann Strauss ,COMMA and how he created the waltzes that became so famous in the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's year by year .PERIOD This comes from our friends at Gapmindercom .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA we talked about ways in which perhaps one could partner to be able to bring the cost of this technology down .PERIOD <BREAK>
And frankly -- and I know that sometimes I offend some of my customers when I say this ,COMMA but I truly mean it -- if you could take the name of the computer off the top of it ,COMMA it would be very difficult to judge who made it ,COMMA because they're all highly commoditized but they're all different .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the last piece ,COMMA which is really important -- and this is an opinion that we have ,COMMA not shared by many ,COMMA this is one where we seem to stand alone ,COMMA on this one -- is that we really believe that the greatest success of this initiative can come by fostering local ,COMMA integrated ,COMMA end-to-end ecosystems .PERIOD <BREAK>
We just recently opened a learning laboratory in a school in the West Cape in South Africa ,COMMA in a school that's called Nelson Mandela School ,COMMA and when you see the faces and activities of these children being able to access computers ,COMMA it's just phenomenal .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we're really thrilled about the opportunity to be part of this ,COMMA and can't wait to see what comes out of this exciting ,COMMA exciting activity .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'll tell you that one of the things that I feel is really critical for us in industry ,COMMA in business ,COMMA is to be able to be passionate about solving these problems .PERIOD <BREAK>
I was eager to go off to college ,COMMA and go find girls ,COMMA and study ,COMMA and girls ,COMMA and study ,COMMA but then I finished college and I fell in love .PERIOD <BREAK>
And on my wedding day ,COMMA my father came to me again and said ,COMMA You know ,COMMA I'm going to remind you again ,COMMA that each generation has to do better than the last one .PERIOD <BREAK>
Just existing .PERIOD <BREAK>
I really think that's there's this inner desire .PERIOD <BREAK>
And all of a sudden ,COMMA it brought a lot of money and a lot of attention .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's kind of a no-brainer .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA what is it for ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
So I believe ,COMMA essentially ,COMMA that leadership is stewardship .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is not my planet .PERIOD It wasn't mine before I was born .PERIOD <BREAK>
Do you think we have a stewardship here ,COMMA to take the environment seriously ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
What we believe ,COMMA obviously -- and you know this -- determines our behavior ,COMMA and our behavior determines what we become in life .PERIOD <BREAK>
My wife and I first made five decisions on what to do with the money .PERIOD <BREAK>
We just said ,COMMA we're not going to use it on us .PERIOD <BREAK>
Believe me ,COMMA there's a whole lot easier ways to make money .PERIOD <BREAK>
The last thing we did is we became what I call reverse tithers .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that is ,COMMA when my wife and I got married 30 years ago ,COMMA we started tithing .PERIOD <BREAK>
Materialism is all about getting -- get ,COMMA get ,COMMA get ,COMMA get all you can ,COMMA can all you get ,COMMA sit on the can and spoil the rest .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we think that the good life is actually looking good -- that's most important of all -- looking good ,COMMA feeling good and having the goods .PERIOD <BREAK>
There's a chapter in the Bible called Psalm 72 ,COMMA and it's Solomon's prayer for more influence .PERIOD <BREAK>
Basically ,COMMA he's talking about all the marginalized in society .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's a shepherd's staff .PERIOD <BREAK>
And ,COMMA by the way ,COMMA my God doesn't have to show up on cheese bread .PERIOD <BREAK>
You know ,COMMA if God's going to show up ,COMMA He's not going to show up on cheese bread .PERIOD <BREAK>
But He doesn't do miracles just to show off .PERIOD <BREAK>
What do you do with a shepherd's staff ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
You pull them or you poke them ,COMMA one or the other .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it represents your influence .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that gives with you enormous influence .PERIOD <BREAK>
What are you doing with what you've been given ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Why would God wire you to do something and then not have you do it ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And in some countries -- let me pick Afghanistan -- 75 percent of the little girls don't go to school .PERIOD <BREAK>
So in the three years since I talked at TED and showed a prototype ,COMMA it's gone from an idea to a real laptop .PERIOD <BREAK>
We have about a quarter of a million in transit to those and other children ,COMMA and then there are another quarter of a million more that are being ordered at this moment .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that engine is going to see the results in 20 years .PERIOD <BREAK>
They own the laptops .PERIOD They take them home .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the reason she brought her mother is that this six-year-old child had been teaching her mother how to read and write .PERIOD <BREAK>
So it's 1995 ,COMMA I'm in college ,COMMA and a friend and I go on a road trip from Providence ,COMMA Rhode Island to Portland ,COMMA Oregon .PERIOD <BREAK>
We get it in the abstract .PERIOD <BREAK>
But the thing is ,COMMA the coyote runs off the cliff right after him .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's when he falls .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is not mine ,COMMA by the way .PERIOD <BREAK>
We learn these really bad lessons really well .PERIOD <BREAK>
When the vice president for health care quality at Beth Israel spoke about this incident ,COMMA he said something very interesting .PERIOD <BREAK>
And yeah ,COMMA it is also why we get things wrong .PERIOD <BREAK>
I just imagined it everywhere ,COMMA which has happened .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the crypto-theme is :COLON 'I thought this one thing was going to happen and something else happened instead' And the thing is ,COMMA says Ira Glass ,COMMA we need this .PERIOD <BREAK>
But ,COMMA you know ,COMMA our stories are like this because our lives are like this .PERIOD <BREAK>
And something else happened instead .PERIOD <BREAK>
Because half the stuff that's the most mind-boggling and world-altering -- TED 1998 -- eh .PERIOD <BREAK>
We come up with another idea .PERIOD <BREAK>
Bioenergy isn't global warming .PERIOD Bioenergy is something which seems counterintuitive .PERIOD Bioenergy is oil .PERIOD It's gas .PERIOD It's coal .PERIOD And part of building that bridge to the future ,COMMA to the point where we can actually see the oceans in a rational way ,COMMA or put up these geo-spatial orbits that will twirl or do microwaves or stuff ,COMMA is going to depend on how we understand bioenergy and manage it .PERIOD And to do that ,COMMA you really have to look first at agriculture .PERIOD <BREAK>
Maybe that's one of the reasons why if you fly over west Texas ,COMMA the types of wells that you're beginning to see don't look unlike those pictures of Kansas and those irrigated plots .PERIOD <BREAK>
Which is curious as we debate all this stuff .PERIOD But as you think of coal ,COMMA this is what burned wheat kernels look like .PERIOD Not entirely unlike coal .PERIOD <BREAK>
That is what bioenergy is .PERIOD It is not ethanol .PERIOD It is not subsidies to a few companies .PERIOD It is not importing corn into Iowa because you've built so many of these ethanol plants .PERIOD It is beginning to understand the transition that occurred in agriculture ,COMMA from brute force into biological force .PERIOD And in the measure that you can do that ,COMMA you can clean some stuff ,COMMA and you can clean it pretty quickly .PERIOD <BREAK>
But in the meantime ,COMMA for the next decade at least ,COMMA the name of the game is hydrocarbons .PERIOD And be that oil ,COMMA be that gas ,COMMA be that coal ,COMMA this is what we're dealing with .PERIOD And before I make this talk too long ,COMMA here's what's happening in the current energy system .PERIOD <BREAK>
86 percent of the energy we consume are hydrocarbons .PERIOD That means 86 percent of the stuff we're consuming are probably processed plants and amoebas and the rest of the stuff .PERIOD And there's a role in here for conservation .PERIOD There's a role in here for alternative stuff ,COMMA but we've also got to get that other portion right .PERIOD <BREAK>
And what gave her inspiration and meaning was the fact that she was taking care of people who were far away from home .PERIOD <BREAK>
In the wake of the dotcom crash and 9 / 11 ,COMMA San Francisco Bay Area hotels went through the largest percentage revenue drop in the history of American hotels .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I initially ended up in the business section of the bookstore looking for a business solution .PERIOD <BREAK>
Each of us ,COMMA no matter what our role is in business ,COMMA has some hierarchy of needs in the workplace .PERIOD <BREAK>
So as I started reading more Maslow ,COMMA what I started to realize is that Maslow ,COMMA later in his life ,COMMA wanted to take this hierarchy for the individual and apply it to the collective ,COMMA to organizations and specifically to business .PERIOD <BREAK>
But as we started asking ourselves about how we were addressing the higher needs of our employees and our customers ,COMMA I realized we had no metrics .PERIOD <BREAK>
So I went out and studied a bunch of things ,COMMA and I found a survey that showed that 94 percent of business leaders worldwide believe that the intangibles are important in their business ,COMMA things like intellectual property ,COMMA their corporate culture ,COMMA their brand loyalty ,COMMA and yet ,COMMA only five percent of those same leaders actually had a means of measuring the intangibles in their business .PERIOD <BREAK>
And he's a very wise man ,COMMA and he said ,COMMA Listen ,COMMA Bhutan's goal is not to create happiness .PERIOD <BREAK>
One of those key indicators is :COLON How do the Bhutanese feel about how they spend their time each day ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Or in other words ,COMMA I think the Bhutanese believe happiness equals wanting what you have -- imagine gratitude -- divided by having what you want -- gratification .PERIOD <BREAK>
So it suggests that the momentum is shifting .PERIOD <BREAK>
As you look at these two columns here ,COMMA doesn't it make you feel like it's time for us to start figuring out a new way to count ,COMMA a new way to imagine what's important to us in life ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
We're spending 10 billion dollars on the census .PERIOD <BREAK>
We're asking 10 simple questions -- it is simplicity .PERIOD <BREAK>
They're about demographics .PERIOD <BREAK>
Abe Maslow said long ago something you've heard before ,COMMA but you didn't realize it was him .PERIOD <BREAK>
He said ,COMMA If the only tool you have is a hammer ,COMMA everything starts to look like a nail .PERIOD <BREAK>
In Vivian's case ,COMMA her unit of production isn't the tangible hours she works ,COMMA it's the intangible difference she makes during that one hour of work .PERIOD <BREAK>
He stayed there a hundred times in the last 20 years ,COMMA and he's loyal to the property because of the relationship that Vivian and her fellow employees have created with him .PERIOD <BREAK>
We don't have to choose between inspired employees and sizable profits ,COMMA we can have both .PERIOD <BREAK>
At least ,COMMA as he wrote ,COMMA when a robot dies ,COMMA you don't have to write a letter to its mother .PERIOD <BREAK>
The US .PERIOD is currently ahead in military robotics right now ,COMMA but we know that in technology there's no such thing as a permanent first move or advantage .PERIOD <BREAK>
There's already a jihadi website that you can go on and remotely detonate an IED in Iraq while sitting at your home computer .PERIOD <BREAK>
Soldiers have a name for these clips .PERIOD <BREAK>
The typical one that I was sent was an email that had an attachment of video of a Predator strike taking out an enemy site .PERIOD Missile hits ,COMMA bodies burst into the air with the explosion .PERIOD <BREAK>
It was set to music .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so we kind of have this kind of moral feel-good moment .PERIOD <BREAK>
That bottle winds up getting burned .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so poor people who are making these products in petrochemical centers like Cancer Alley ,COMMA poor people who are consuming these products disproportionately ,COMMA and then poor people ,COMMA who even at the tail end of the recycling are having their lives shortened ,COMMA are all being harmed greatly by this addiction that we have to disposability .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now you think to yourself -- because I know how you are -- you say ,COMMA That sure is terrible for those poor people .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's just awful ,COMMA those poor people .PERIOD <BREAK>
I hope someone does something to help them .PERIOD <BREAK>
But guess what ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
We don't have disposable resources .PERIOD <BREAK>
And as we all begin to come back to that basic understanding ,COMMA new opportunities for action begin to emerge .PERIOD <BREAK>
But if we want to make something hard ,COMMA we come up ,COMMA I know ,COMMA I'm going to make a hard substance .PERIOD <BREAK>
We just had this vote ,COMMA and everybody's like ,COMMA Well ,COMMA not in our state .PERIOD <BREAK>
Just so proud .PERIOD <BREAK>
But California ,COMMA though we lead the world in some of the green stuff ,COMMA we also ,COMMA unfortunately ,COMMA lead the world in some of the gulag stuff .PERIOD <BREAK>
We have a moral challenge in this moment .PERIOD <BREAK>
And really ,COMMA they fundamentally told you ,COMMA Are you going to hug a tree ,COMMA or are you going to hug a child ?QUESTIONMARK Pick .PERIOD <BREAK>
Well ,COMMA when you start working on issues like plastic ,COMMA you realize that the whole thing is connected ,COMMA and luckily most of us are blessed to have two arms .PERIOD <BREAK>
They'd worn themselves out ,COMMA beating themselves against the window ,COMMA and ,COMMA well ,COMMA they were easy to capture .PERIOD <BREAK>
I've called this vehicle ,COMMA generically ,COMMA a volantor ,COMMA after the Latin word volant ,COMMA meaning ,COMMA to fly in a light ,COMMA nimble manner .PERIOD <BREAK>
Volantor-like helicopter ,COMMA perhaps .PERIOD <BREAK>
The press calls my particular volantor a Skycar .PERIOD <BREAK>
One could say that a helicopter does pretty much what the hummingbird does ,COMMA and gets around in much the same way ,COMMA and it's true ,COMMA but a helicopter is a very complex device .PERIOD <BREAK>
Because if you're in this world ,COMMA where computers are controlling what you're doing ,COMMA it's going to be very critical that something can't fail on you .PERIOD <BREAK>
Well ,COMMA you can't right now take off from your home because it's too noisy .PERIOD <BREAK>
I mean to be able to take off from your home ,COMMA you'd have to be extremely quiet .PERIOD <BREAK>
After all ,COMMA if you can fly like that ,COMMA why are you going to drive around on a highway ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
You can play computer games ,COMMA you can sleep ,COMMA you can read on the way .PERIOD <BREAK>
And then through the various years we invented various vehicles .PERIOD <BREAK>
Redundancy is the critical issue here .PERIOD <BREAK>
If you want to stay alive you've got to have backups .PERIOD <BREAK>
that's a very significant incentive for getting out of San Francisco .PERIOD <BREAK>
But you better be the first one out of town as the real estate values go to hell .PERIOD <BREAK>
There's an interesting poll that came out recently under NAS -- I think it's MSNBC -- in which they asked the question ,COMMA Are you in the market for a volantor ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
I mean ,COMMA think about how much we love this .PERIOD <BREAK>
Think about that .PERIOD <BREAK>
What Dr .PERIOD Soljacic figured out how to do was separate the coils in a transformer to a greater distance than the size of those transformers using this technology ,COMMA which is not dissimilar from the way an opera singer shatters a glass on the other side of the room .PERIOD <BREAK>
And what I'm going to do is to show you pretty much what's here .PERIOD <BREAK>
And if the demo gods are willing ,COMMA in about 10 seconds or so we should see it .PERIOD <BREAK>
Think about it .PERIOD You don't want those ugly cords coming down .PERIOD <BREAK>
Imagine if you can get rid of it .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I'll do it again ,COMMA just for safety's sake .PERIOD <BREAK>
We're an equal opportunity designer of this sort of thing .PERIOD <BREAK>
It runs the Android operating system .PERIOD <BREAK>
So we put a little sleeve on the back ,COMMA but we should be able to get this guy to wake up too .PERIOD <BREAK>
And think of what that would do for you .PERIOD <BREAK>
And third ,COMMA our bodies are filters and storehouses for environmental toxins .PERIOD <BREAK>
If you're cremated ,COMMA all those toxins I mentioned are released into the atmosphere .PERIOD <BREAK>
So by trying to preserve our dead bodies ,COMMA we deny death ,COMMA poison the living and further harm the environment .PERIOD <BREAK>
I realize this is not the kind of relationship that we usually aspire to have with our food .PERIOD <BREAK>
The Decompiculture Society shares a vision of a cultural shift ,COMMA from our current culture of death denial and body preservation to one of decompiculture ,COMMA a radical acceptance of death and decomposition .PERIOD <BREAK>
So the Virtual Earth initiative ,COMMA and other types of these initiatives ,COMMA are all about extending our current search metaphor .PERIOD <BREAK>
Well ,COMMA a little unknown secret is his brother actually works on the Virtual Earth team .PERIOD <BREAK>
When we think about how all this comes together ,COMMA it's all about software ,COMMA algorithms and math .PERIOD <BREAK>
We do this all through software ,COMMA algorithms and math -- a highly automated pipeline creating these cities .PERIOD <BREAK>
But what we've found is they like the fluidity of the 3 -D model .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'm going to use these two countries to make an economic argument for democracy ,COMMA rather than against democracy .PERIOD <BREAK>
Look at the skyline of Shanghai .PERIOD <BREAK>
The picture on India is the Dharavi slum of Mumbai in India .PERIOD <BREAK>
In an interview printed in the financial press of India ,COMMA He said that he wants to make Mumbai another Shanghai .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is an Oxford-trained economist steeped in humanistic values ,COMMA and yet he agrees with the high-pressure tactics of Shanghai .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is a very little known fact about the two countries .PERIOD <BREAK>
The economy grows ,COMMA government accumulates more resources ,COMMA and the government can invest in infrastructure -- rather than infrastructure being a cause for economic growth .PERIOD <BREAK>
One reason is the East Asian Model .PERIOD <BREAK>
Korea succeeded ,COMMA North Korea didn't .PERIOD <BREAK>
Burma didn't succeed .PERIOD <BREAK>
In China ,COMMA it's all women .PERIOD <BREAK>
By looking at these two pictures ,COMMA I say no ,COMMA it won't overtake China for a while .PERIOD <BREAK>
Actually ,COMMA the answer is more nuanced and subtle than that .PERIOD <BREAK>
Indira Gandhi declared emergency rule in 1975 .PERIOD <BREAK>
Why do many people believe that India is still a growth disaster ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
But China is a superstar in terms of economic growth .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is the Grand Cafe here in Oxford .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's its great claim to fame ,COMMA and I wanted to show it to you ,COMMA not because I want to give you the kind of Starbucks tour of historic England ,COMMA but rather because the English coffeehouse was crucial to the development and spread of one of the great intellectual flowerings of the last 500 years ,COMMA what we now call the Enlightenment .PERIOD <BREAK>
What are the environments that lead to unusual levels of innovation ,COMMA unusual levels of creativity ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And this is what they ended up coming with .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's called a neonurture device .PERIOD <BREAK>
In the inside ,COMMA it's all car parts .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's got a fan ,COMMA it's got headlights for warmth ,COMMA it's got door chimes for alarm -- it runs off a car battery .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is Hogarth's famous painting of a kind of political dinner at a tavern ,COMMA but this is what the coffee shops looked like back then .PERIOD <BREAK>
And one of the problems with this is that people are actually -- when you research this field -- people are notoriously unreliable ,COMMA when they actually kind of self-report on where they have their own good ideas ,COMMA or their history of their best ideas .PERIOD <BREAK>
So when they were sitting in front of the microscope ,COMMA when they were talking to their colleague at the water cooler ,COMMA and all these things .PERIOD <BREAK>
But that's a key thing .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so they ask around to a couple of their colleagues ,COMMA and everybody's like ,COMMA No ,COMMA I hadn't thought of doing that .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so Guier and Weiffenbach go back to Weiffenbach's office ,COMMA and they start kind of noodling around -- hacking ,COMMA as we might call it now .PERIOD <BREAK>
We should record it .PERIOD <BREAK>
And they thought about it and they said ,COMMA Well ,COMMA I guess maybe you could .PERIOD Let's run the numbers here .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I bet you one of you ,COMMA if not more ,COMMA has used said device and said satellite system to locate a nearby coffeehouse somewhere in the last -- in the last day or last week ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Chance favors the connected mind .PERIOD <BREAK>
My story starts way before I was born .PERIOD <BREAK>
They got on and didn't know where they were going ,COMMA and ended up in Canada .PERIOD <BREAK>
I was 14 ,COMMA and I emailed professors at the local university to see if maybe I could go work in their lab .PERIOD And hardly anyone responded .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so I thought ,COMMA Maybe if it can promote cell growth ,COMMA it can inhibit cell death ,COMMA too .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so that's the project that I pursued for that year ,COMMA and it's continuing now as well ,COMMA and found that a specific purine derivative called guanidine had inhibited the cell growth by approximately 60 percent .PERIOD <BREAK>
But I'd heard of cancer as the most feared disease of our time ,COMMA so how did the good and bad go together ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And while I was doing this ,COMMA I was reading the cancer literature ,COMMA trying to -- again -- familiarize myself with this new medical field .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it was really interesting -- there were articles correlating if you have a bone fracture ,COMMA and then bone cancer arises .PERIOD <BREAK>
It hasn't yet become fine-tuned enough to finish what has been initiated .PERIOD <BREAK>
If we eliminate cancer the way we're trying to do now ,COMMA with chemotherapy and radiation ,COMMA we're bombarding the body or the cancer with toxins ,COMMA or with radiation ,COMMA trying to kill it .PERIOD <BREAK>
We're removing the cancer cells ,COMMA but we're revealing the previous damage that the body has tried to fix .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA this really changed my view of looking at cancer .PERIOD <BREAK>
And what metastases are is when the tumor -- when a piece -- breaks off and travels through the blood stream and goes to a different organ .PERIOD That's what a metastasis is .PERIOD <BREAK>
But then again ,COMMA this fact that the metastases didn't go to skeletal muscle made that seem unlikely .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I guess I'll keep investigating until I get the answers .PERIOD <BREAK>
Is it possible that muscle somehow intuitively knows that it needs this blood supply ?QUESTIONMARK It needs to be constantly contracting ,COMMA so therefore it's almost selfish .PERIOD It's grabbing its blood vessels for itself .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I hate to say that .PERIOD But it seems as though muscle cell ,COMMA possibly because of all its use ,COMMA has adapted faster than other body tissues to respond to injury ,COMMA to fine-tune this repair response and actually be able to finish the process which the body wants to finish .PERIOD I really believe that the human body is very ,COMMA very smart ,COMMA and we can't counteract something the body is saying to do .PERIOD <BREAK>
And again ,COMMA some of these may be far-fetched ,COMMA but I figured if there's anywhere to present far-fetched ideas ,COMMA it's here at TED ,COMMA so thank you very much .PERIOD <BREAK>
Some of you have heard the story before ,COMMA but ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA there's somebody in the audience who's never heard this story -- in front of an audience -- before ,COMMA so I'm a little more nervous than I normally am telling this story .PERIOD <BREAK>
And then ,COMMA my translator left .PERIOD <BREAK>
They slept on the floor at night .PERIOD <BREAK>
I had photographed ,COMMA as I said ,COMMA a lot of these kids .PERIOD <BREAK>
Again ,COMMA not at all shy or withdrawn ,COMMA or anything like the other children that I'd photographed .PERIOD <BREAK>
It was very obvious ,COMMA from the very beginning ,COMMA that she was a leader .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I said to my translator ,COMMA What's going on ,COMMA why is she crying ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And I said ,COMMA I'm 28 years old ,COMMA and I live in hotels ,COMMA and I'm not married .PERIOD <BREAK>
And they had no idea about this request that she'd made of me .PERIOD <BREAK>
So I finally found Myung Sung ,COMMA her best friend that she used to play with after school every day .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I said to the translator ,COMMA What did he say ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And I said ,COMMA Well ,COMMA tell him that I am a photographer .PERIOD <BREAK>
I sort of had this picture of this incredibly wonderful ,COMMA bright ,COMMA happy little child ,COMMA who now appeared to be very withdrawn ,COMMA being enslaved by this family .PERIOD <BREAK>
So I finally decided ,COMMA I said Look ,COMMA -- this is all through the translator ,COMMA because ,COMMA this is all ,COMMA you know ,COMMA I don't speak a word of Korean -- and I said ,COMMA Look ,COMMA I'm really glad that Hyun-Sook has a family to live with .PERIOD <BREAK>
I don't pretend to understand what's going on here .PERIOD <BREAK>
Well ,COMMA there was an American Marine priest that I had met in the course of doing the story ,COMMA who had 75 children living in his house .PERIOD <BREAK>
He had kids from all over Korea living there ,COMMA and he would find families for these kids .PERIOD <BREAK>
Hyun-Sook stayed at Father Keene's ,COMMA and her uncle agreed to let her stay there until the adoption went through .PERIOD <BREAK>
And then she set up a work detail list of who cleaned the orphanage on what day .PERIOD <BREAK>
We went back to our hotel room ,COMMA and Gene was showing Natasha also where Atlanta was .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we fall asleep -- and I've been in this room ,COMMA you know ,COMMA for a couple of months now .PERIOD <BREAK>
And they always overheat the hotels in Korea terribly ,COMMA so during the day I always left the window open .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I don't speak Korean ,COMMA but I'm hearing these voices ,COMMA and I'm not hearing anger ,COMMA I'm hearing terror .PERIOD <BREAK>
I remember his son had the LL .PERIOD Bean bootlaces ,COMMA and we're trying to do up his laces .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA we ran to the bathroom ,COMMA and got towels ,COMMA and put them over our faces ,COMMA and the kids faces .PERIOD <BREAK>
Eleven people ended up dying in the fire .PERIOD <BREAK>
Five people jumped and died ,COMMA other people were killed by the smoke .PERIOD <BREAK>
So it turned into a dual celebration ,COMMA because Natasha was the first person from this village ever to go to the United States .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is saying goodbye to everybody at the orphanage .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the pilot ,COMMA Jeff Cowley ,COMMA actually went back and adopted one of the other kids at the orphanage after meeting Natasha .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA at this point ,COMMA Natasha doesn't speak a word of English ,COMMA other than what little Father Keene taught her .PERIOD <BREAK>
She learned English in three months .PERIOD <BREAK>
Natasha told me that a lot of the kids thought she was stuck up ,COMMA because they would talk to her and she wouldn't answer ,COMMA and they didn't realize she didn't actually speak English very well ,COMMA in the beginning .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA remember the picture ,COMMA how much she looked like her grandmother ,COMMA at the beginning ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
The captain of the cheerleaders .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is her half-sister .PERIOD <BREAK>
Natasha ,COMMA would you just come up ,COMMA for a second ,COMMA just maybe to say hello to everybody ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Natasha :COLON I've seen pictures millions of times ,COMMA but today was the first time I'm actually seeing him give the whole presentation .PERIOD <BREAK>
I started crying .PERIOD <BREAK>
The telescope is actually built similarly to the ,COMMA well-known to you ,COMMA Hubble Space Telescope ,COMMA except it does have an additional lens -- a wide-field lens ,COMMA as you would call it as a photographer .PERIOD <BREAK>
The way we do that ,COMMA actually ,COMMA is with a method ,COMMA which we call the transit method .PERIOD <BREAK>
But we learn a lot from that :COLON not only that there is a planet there ,COMMA but we also learn its size .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA what have we learned ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And we do care about planets like the Earth because by now we understood that life as a chemical system really needs a smaller planet with water and with rocks and with a lot of complex chemistry to originate ,COMMA to emerge ,COMMA to survive .PERIOD <BREAK>
So today ,COMMA I'm here to actually give you a first glimpse of what the new telescope ,COMMA Kepler ,COMMA has been able to tell us in the last few weeks ,COMMA and ,COMMA lo and behold ,COMMA we are back to the harmony and to fulfilling the dreams of Copernicus .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's about 100 million such planets .PERIOD <BREAK>
So that's great because then we can go and study them -- remotely ,COMMA of course -- with all the techniques that we already have tested in the past five years .PERIOD <BREAK>
The one that this step is enabling us to do is coming next .PERIOD <BREAK>
So the question is :COLON is that chemical phenomenon universal ,COMMA or is it something which depends on the planet ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
We don't want to go blind because there's too many possibilities ,COMMA and there is not too much lab ,COMMA and there is not enough human time to actually to do all the experiments .PERIOD <BREAK>
Well ,COMMA there are many reasons ,COMMA and you heard some of them in the short talk today .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that is going to change our worldview in a profound way -- not in a dissimilar way as 400 years ago ,COMMA Copernicus' act did ,COMMA by changing the way we view space and time .PERIOD <BREAK>
And half the time ,COMMA what's happened is it's related this kind of sense of insignificance to humankind ,COMMA to the Earth in a bigger space .PERIOD <BREAK>
I mean look ,COMMA you can see the necktie ,COMMA but you can't even imagine seeing the size of a little ,COMMA small atom .PERIOD <BREAK>
So what does this tell us ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
There is immense ,COMMA powerful potential in life in this universe -- especially now that we know that places like the Earth are common .PERIOD <BREAK>
Let's start this new revolution at the tail end of the old one ,COMMA with synthetic biology being the way to transform both our environment and our future .PERIOD <BREAK>
These Gapminder bubbles show you how the spread of the virus was in 1983 in the world ,COMMA or how we estimate that it was .PERIOD <BREAK>
Look ,COMMA India got many infected ,COMMA but had a low level .PERIOD <BREAK>
And almost the same happens here .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA let me make a fast replay of Botswana .PERIOD <BREAK>
And if people who are infected are treated ,COMMA they don't die of AIDS .PERIOD <BREAK>
In spite of PEPFAR ,COMMA the generous PEPFAR ,COMMA all people are not reached by treatment ,COMMA and of those who are reached by treatment in the poor countries ,COMMA only 60 percent are left on treatment after two years .PERIOD <BREAK>
No ,COMMA it's not .PERIOD Look here .PERIOD <BREAK>
There's a lot of things that we thought ,COMMA that now ,COMMA good research ,COMMA done by African institutions and researchers together with the international researchers ,COMMA show that that's not the case .PERIOD <BREAK>
See the difference within one African country -- it goes from very low level to very high level ,COMMA and most of the provinces in Kenya is quite modest .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA what is it then ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
It could be concurrency .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we have a terrible chlamydia epidemic -- terrible chlamydia epidemic which sticks around for many years .PERIOD <BREAK>
Let's talk about past and future billions .PERIOD <BREAK>
We know that most of that wealth was made after the year 1800 .PERIOD <BREAK>
And notice ,COMMA most of that went to the motherland ,COMMA to the imperial metropoles ,COMMA not to their colonial possessions .PERIOD <BREAK>
So I'm going to translate this into language that you can understand .PERIOD <BREAK>
Let me very briefly tell you what I mean by this ,COMMA synthesizing the work of many economic historians in the process .PERIOD <BREAK>
That really was a killer application .PERIOD <BREAK>
Property rights :COLON It's not the democracy ,COMMA folks ;SEMICOLON it's having the rule of law based on private property rights .PERIOD <BREAK>
Very few Indians today wish that India had gone down Mahatma Gandhi's road .PERIOD <BREAK>
Finally ,COMMA the work ethic .PERIOD <BREAK>
He was wrong .PERIOD <BREAK>
Take a look at mathematical attainment by 15 year-olds .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now it's just five times ,COMMA and soon it will be 25 times .PERIOD <BREAK>
And could Africa get that sequencing wrong ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
One obvious implication of modern economic history is that it's quite hard to transition to democracy before you've established secure private property rights .PERIOD <BREAK>
Warning :COLON that may not work .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's the basis for the Western model of representative government .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I think these words really nail it :COLON It means a society based upon the opinion of civilians .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's not the way history works .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's one of the most profound insights to come out of the historical study of complex institutions like civilizations .PERIOD <BREAK>
What's your view on that ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Niall Ferguson :COLON Well I really am not just talking about the rise of the East ;SEMICOLON I'm talking about the rise of the Rest ,COMMA and that includes South America .PERIOD <BREAK>
I once asked one of my colleagues at Harvard ,COMMA Hey ,COMMA is South America part of the West ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Spiders are not just everywhere ,COMMA but they're extremely diverse .PERIOD <BREAK>
Spiders are also extremely old .PERIOD <BREAK>
Even fossil spiders can make silk ,COMMA as we can see from this impression of a spinneret on this fossil spider .PERIOD <BREAK>
So this means that both spiders and spider silk have been around for 380 million years .PERIOD <BREAK>
You can see multiple fibers coming out of the spinnerets ,COMMA because each spinneret has many spigots on it .PERIOD <BREAK>
In an orb-web-weaving spider ,COMMA you can find seven types of silk glands ,COMMA and what I have depicted here in this picture ,COMMA let's start at the one o'clock position ,COMMA there's tubuliform silk glands ,COMMA which are used to make the outer silk of an egg sac .PERIOD <BREAK>
So silk fibers vary in their strength and also their extensibility .PERIOD <BREAK>
If it wasn't able to stretch so much ,COMMA then basically when an insect hit the web ,COMMA it would just trampoline right off of it .PERIOD <BREAK>
Some of them are orb-weaving spiders and some of them are non-orb-weaving spiders .PERIOD <BREAK>
How do groups get anything done ?QUESTIONMARK Right ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
How do you organize a group of individuals so that the output of the group is something coherent and of lasting value ,COMMA instead of just being chaos ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And a coordination cost is essentially all of the financial or institutional difficulties in arranging group output .PERIOD <BREAK>
More recently ,COMMA because the cost of letting groups communicate with each other has fallen through the floor -- and communication costs are one of the big inputs to coordination -- there has been a second answer ,COMMA which is to put the cooperation into the infrastructure ,COMMA to design systems that coordinate the output of the group as a by-product of the operating of the system ,COMMA without regard to institutional models .PERIOD <BREAK>
And what I want to call your attention to is not the Mermaid Parade itself ,COMMA charming though it is ,COMMA but rather to these photos .PERIOD <BREAK>
First of all ,COMMA when you form an institution ,COMMA you take on a management problem ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
You have to have legal structure .PERIOD <BREAK>
Third ,COMMA forming an institution is inherently exclusionary .PERIOD <BREAK>
You can't hire everyone in a company ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
When you build cooperation into the infrastructure ,COMMA which is the Flickr answer ,COMMA you can leave the people where they are and you take the problem to the individuals ,COMMA rather than moving the individuals to the problem .PERIOD <BREAK>
In bigger systems ,COMMA the head gets bigger and the tail gets longer ,COMMA so the imbalance increases .PERIOD <BREAK>
If you go down to five percent ,COMMA you're still accounting for 60 percent of the photos .PERIOD <BREAK>
We've looked at who's contributed to Linux ,COMMA and most of the patches have been produced by programmers who've only done one thing .PERIOD Right ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Do you want that patch ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Meetup ,COMMA a service founded so that users could find people in their local area who share their interests and affinities and actually have a real-world meeting offline in a cafe or a pub or what have you .PERIOD <BREAK>
Stay-at-home moms .PERIOD Right ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
It is a one-button operation that you can do for free .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the answer to that question is ,COMMA it doesn't matter ,COMMA because that's not the right question .PERIOD <BREAK>
And if there is an answer to that that happens outside the professional framework of journalism ,COMMA it makes no sense to take a professional metaphor and apply it to this distributed class .PERIOD <BREAK>
They trade tips ,COMMA like ,COMMA if you feel like eating something ,COMMA clean a toilet or the litter box .PERIOD The feeling will pass .PERIOD <BREAK>
We have an attitude that support groups are inherently beneficial .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA when the larger group is a bunch of drunks ,COMMA and the small group wants to stay sober ,COMMA then we think ,COMMA that's a great support group .PERIOD <BREAK>
But when the small group is teenage girls who want to stay anorexic by choice ,COMMA then we're horrified .PERIOD <BREAK>
Flavor is king .PERIOD Flavor rules .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA this is the challenge for this bread .PERIOD <BREAK>
And this is what every student has to begin with .PERIOD <BREAK>
Everyone who works in the culinary world knows that the first stage of cooking is mise en place ,COMMA which is just a French way of saying ,COMMA get organized .PERIOD <BREAK>
Everything in its place .PERIOD First stage .PERIOD <BREAK>
Stage two is mixing .PERIOD We take the ingredients and we mix them .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so we ,COMMA in the mixing process ,COMMA have to develop the gluten ,COMMA we have to activate the leaven or the yeast ,COMMA and we have to essentially distribute all the ingredients evenly .PERIOD <BREAK>
And at stage nine we get the dough to the final shape ,COMMA and it goes into the oven -- stage 10 .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the starches ,COMMA when they reach about 180 degrees ,COMMA gelatinize .PERIOD <BREAK>
And stage 11 ,COMMA we call it cooling -- because we never really eat the bread right away .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we save some of those for the next generation .PERIOD <BREAK>
So we turn it into flour .PERIOD <BREAK>
Not like hot water made cold ,COMMA or cold water turned hot ,COMMA but water boiled off and becoming steam .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA we've got now this flour .PERIOD <BREAK>
And what do we do ?QUESTIONMARK We add some water .PERIOD <BREAK>
Or another analogy would be ,COMMA a caterpillar has been turned into a butterfly .PERIOD <BREAK>
But we've got this bread ,COMMA and what I did here is to try to ,COMMA again ,COMMA evoke even more flavor from this grain ,COMMA was we've added into it the spent grain from beer-making .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so this is ,COMMA again ,COMMA hopefully not only a healthy bread ,COMMA but a bread that you will enjoy .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA if I ,COMMA kind of ,COMMA break this bread ,COMMA maybe we can share this now a little bit here .PERIOD <BREAK>
We'll start a little piece here ,COMMA and I'm going to take a little piece here -- I think I'd better taste it myself before you have it at lunch .PERIOD <BREAK>
Let me give you just one example of this .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now the question is :COLON How could we ask them ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
But half the time ,COMMA what she would do is take a little bit of the broccoli and go ,COMMA Mmmmm ,COMMA broccoli .PERIOD <BREAK>
So she'd act as if what she wanted was just the opposite of what the babies wanted .PERIOD <BREAK>
The question you might ask though is :COLON Why do children learn so much ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Well what kind of explanation could we have for this ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And essentially what Bayes did was to provide a mathematical way using probability theory to characterize ,COMMA describe ,COMMA the way that scientists find out about the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
And some 10 years ago ,COMMA I suggested that babies might be doing the same thing .PERIOD <BREAK>
Because if you wave a block over the top of the detector ,COMMA something you wouldn't ever think of to begin with ,COMMA the detector will actually activate two out of three times .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now there are two things that are really interesting about this .PERIOD <BREAK>
The first one is ,COMMA again ,COMMA remember ,COMMA these are four year-olds .PERIOD <BREAK>
They're just learning how to count .PERIOD <BREAK>
And there's been a bunch of interesting studies recently that have shown this playing around is really a kind of experimental research program .PERIOD <BREAK>
I don't know .PERIOD <BREAK>
Not working either .PERIOD <BREAK>
I think babies and children are actually more conscious than we are as adults .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's good to be a grownup .PERIOD <BREAK>
That technology is simulating humans .PERIOD <BREAK>
And what you can see is -- it is actually a very good game .PERIOD <BREAK>
I've made him run into a wall here ,COMMA over and over again .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA we simulated that as well ,COMMA and then the really tricky bit is to teach that network how to walk .PERIOD <BREAK>
We heard about those already yesterday ,COMMA and I suppose that most of you are familiar with that already .PERIOD <BREAK>
Those are then selected by the algorithm ,COMMA reproduced with mutation and recombinations to introduce sex as well .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA this might look kind of trivial ,COMMA but it's actually very important because this is not something you get at the moment in any interactive or any virtual worlds .PERIOD <BREAK>
So that's what you see here .PERIOD <BREAK>
We just took this character that I just talked about ,COMMA put it on a slippery surface ,COMMA and this is what you get out of it .PERIOD <BREAK>
So that you don't have a character that looks limp ,COMMA but actually a character that you can use in an action film straight away ,COMMA that looks kind of alive in midair as well .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's one angle ;SEMICOLON here's another angle .PERIOD <BREAK>
So this is exactly the same behavior that you saw ,COMMA but in a slightly better rendered version .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is incredibly quick .PERIOD This is happening in real time .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is another behavior they requested .PERIOD <BREAK>
You feel kind of sorry for the guy .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's even worse -- and that is another video I just got last night -- if you render that a bit more realistically .PERIOD <BREAK>
Yes ,COMMA you can just about see it here .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA we've just tried and -- looked at our character and asked ourselves ,COMMA Can we do that ourselves as well ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
This was an AI contour that was produced and evolved -- half-evolved ,COMMA I should say -- to produce balance ,COMMA basically .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA that all happened automatically .PERIOD We didn't put that in there .PERIOD <BREAK>
Thanks .PERIOD <BREAK>
You can draw ,COMMA as everyone should .PERIOD <BREAK>
Shake it ,COMMA and you have a heterosexual couple .PERIOD <BREAK>
You know ,COMMA I'm making a very important argument .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'm making an argument that art and creativity are very essential tools in empathy .PERIOD <BREAK>
Say your motorcycle crashes .PERIOD <BREAK>
OK .PERIOD When I was offered the Times column six years ago ,COMMA the deal was like this :COLON you'll be sent the coolest ,COMMA hottest ,COMMA slickest new gadgets .PERIOD <BREAK>
Every week it'll arrive at your door .PERIOD <BREAK>
The job ,COMMA though ,COMMA came with one small downside .PERIOD And that is :COLON they intended to publish my email address at the end of every column .PERIOD <BREAK>
The guy had a duplicate headset for me to listen to .PERIOD <BREAK>
Some of the stories are just so classic ,COMMA and yet so understandable .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the technician's like ,COMMA Ma'am ,COMMA you've got the mouse up against the screen ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And we've arrived at the age of interface matrices ,COMMA where there are so many features and options ,COMMA you have to do two dimensions ,COMMA you know :COLON a vertical and a horizontal .PERIOD You guys all complained about how Microsoft Word is always bulleting your lists and underlining your links automatically .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's not like the rest of the screen is so full of other components that you need to collapse the choices .PERIOD <BREAK>
So there is a limit that we don't want to cross .PERIOD So what is the answer ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
I'm sorry ;SEMICOLON it's not one yet .PERIOD <BREAK>
You have to scroll ,COMMA like ,COMMA seven screens-full to get to it .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's like a 747 shuttle cockpit .PERIOD <BREAK>
You do not .PERIOD <BREAK>
We've entered planet domination mode .PERIOD <BREAK>
They're dying to throw the whole thing out and start fresh ,COMMA but they can't .PERIOD They're locked in because so many add-ons and other company stuff locks into the old 1982 chassis .PERIOD <BREAK>
I liked the Media Center PC .PERIOD I liked the Microsoft SPOT Watch .PERIOD <BREAK>
The lesson was :COLON simplicity sells .PERIOD <BREAK>
Here's another example .PERIOD Chris ,COMMA you're the source of all power .PERIOD <BREAK>
In my very last example -- I do a lot of my work using speech recognition software ,COMMA and you have to be kind of quiet because the software is nervous .PERIOD <BREAK>
I also use this feature called voice macros .PERIOD Period .PERIOD <BREAK>
Correct dissuade .PERIOD Not just .PERIOD <BREAK>
No new features .PERIOD It's never happened before in software !EXCLAMATIONMARK <BREAK>
It could be the design of the thing you're using .PERIOD <BREAK>
But I also ,COMMA in looking at more powerful technologies and nanotechnology and genetic engineering and other new emerging kind of digital technologies ,COMMA became very concerned about the potential for abuse .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we can't fight the threat in the kind of stupid way we're doing ,COMMA because a million-dollar act causes a billion dollars of damage ,COMMA causes a trillion dollar response which is largely ineffective and arguably ,COMMA probably almost certainly ,COMMA has made the problem worse .PERIOD <BREAK>
So after giving up on the book -- and I had the great honor to be able to join Kleiner Perkins about a year ago ,COMMA and to work through venture capital on the innovative side ,COMMA and to try to find some innovations that could address what I saw as some of these big problems .PERIOD <BREAK>
Things where ,COMMA you know ,COMMA a factor of 10 difference can make a factor of 1000 difference in the outcome .PERIOD <BREAK>
The first is this whole area of education ,COMMA and it really relates to what Nicholas was talking about with a $ 100 computer .PERIOD <BREAK>
I think the challenge for us is -- I'm very certain that that will happen ,COMMA the challenge is ,COMMA will we develop the kind of educational tools and things with the net to let us take advantage of that device ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
I'd argue today that we have incredibly powerful computers ,COMMA but we don't have very good software for them .PERIOD <BREAK>
So given that we know and should believe -- because Moore's Law's been ,COMMA like ,COMMA a constant ,COMMA I mean ,COMMA it's just been very predictable progress over the last 40 years or whatever .PERIOD <BREAK>
We have a challenge ,COMMA because the urban population is growing in this century from two billion to six billion in a very short amount of time .PERIOD People are moving to the cities .PERIOD <BREAK>
And these are the kinds of things we're going to discover as we start to engineer at the nano scale .PERIOD <BREAK>
We believe that Genentech ,COMMA the Compaq ,COMMA the Lotus ,COMMA the Sun ,COMMA the Netscape ,COMMA the Amazon ,COMMA the Google in these fields are yet to be found ,COMMA because this materials revolution will drive these things forward .PERIOD <BREAK>
And to give you an idea of the last fund that Kleiner raised was a $ 400 million fund ,COMMA so this for us is a very substantial fund .PERIOD <BREAK>
And what we did ,COMMA over the last few months -- well ,COMMA a few months ago ,COMMA Ray Kurzweil and I wrote an op-ed in the New York Times about how publishing the 1918 genome was very dangerous .PERIOD <BREAK>
You normally get a trivalent vaccine against three possible strains .PERIOD <BREAK>
We believe that if we could fill these 10 gaps ,COMMA we have a chance to help really reduce the risk of a pandemic .PERIOD <BREAK>
So we're very excited because we think we can fund 10 ,COMMA or speed up 10 projects and see them come to market in the next couple years that will address this .PERIOD <BREAK>
But above all ,COMMA what we have to do is we have to help the good guys ,COMMA the people on the defensive side ,COMMA have an advantage over the people who want to abuse things .PERIOD <BREAK>
Many of them are trying to kill us from the minute we go into them ,COMMA but nevertheless ,COMMA they're absolutely gripping ,COMMA and contain unbelievable biological wonders that are very ,COMMA very different from those that we have on the planet .PERIOD <BREAK>
Apart from the intrinsic value of the biology and mineralogy and geo-microbiology that we do there ,COMMA we're also using these as templates for figuring out how to go look for life on other planets .PERIOD <BREAK>
Particularly Mars ,COMMA but also Europa ,COMMA the small ,COMMA icy moon around Jupiter .PERIOD <BREAK>
We're getting ready to begin to go through the process of leaving our planet of origin and out into the wider solar system and beyond .PERIOD <BREAK>
I think ,COMMA myself ,COMMA that life is a natural outgrowth of the increasing complexification of matter over time .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's going to be everywhere we look -- where there are planetary systems that can possibly support it .PERIOD <BREAK>
So this is a very bold statement .PERIOD <BREAK>
How do you know it when you find it ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Very critically ,COMMA how do we protect it ,COMMA if we find it ,COMMA and not contaminate it ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
If I were to take a swab off your teeth and plate it on a Petri plate ,COMMA within about four or five hours ,COMMA I would have to see growth .PERIOD <BREAK>
So they are ,COMMA intrinsically ,COMMA a slower life-form .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's a very simple trick ,COMMA and I never fail to do it when I'm sitting in a window seat .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is regularly several hundred parts per million .PERIOD <BREAK>
And these are mineral deposits that are also made by bacteria .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so ,COMMA one can send a thousand of them ,COMMA as you can see in this upper left-hand picture ,COMMA a thousand of them could fit into the payload bay that was used for one of the current MER Rovers .PERIOD <BREAK>
The question as to whether there is life on Mars that is related to life on Earth has now been very muddied ,COMMA because we now know ,COMMA from Mars meteorites that have made it to Earth ,COMMA that there's material that can be exchanged between those two planets .PERIOD <BREAK>
One of the burning questions ,COMMA of course ,COMMA is if we go there and find life in the sub-surface ,COMMA as I fully expect that we will ,COMMA is that a second genesis of life ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Did it start there and get transported here ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
This will be a fascinating puzzle as we go into the next half-century ,COMMA and where I expect that we will have more and more Mars missions to answer these questions .PERIOD <BREAK>
For real -- you can take a second .PERIOD You've got to feel this to learn it .PERIOD <BREAK>
Well ,COMMA you could resist the temptation to announce your goal .PERIOD <BREAK>
He wouldn't reveal the exact number of bottles ,COMMA he would not reveal exactly where the building was and he would not reveal exactly who owned the building .PERIOD <BREAK>
And he ended up spending over a million dollars and hiring ex-FBI and ex-Scotland Yard agents to try to get to the bottom of this .PERIOD <BREAK>
There are very few places in the US .PERIOD where you can try real Kobe ,COMMA and one of them is Wolfgang Puck's restaurant ,COMMA Cut ,COMMA in Los Angeles .PERIOD <BREAK>
It was like ,COMMA 160 dollars for this ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And then I was left with these little ugly flakes on my pasta that ,COMMA you know ,COMMA their purpose had been served ,COMMA and so I'm afraid to say that this was also a disappointment to me .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is soap that's made from silver nanoparticles ,COMMA which have antibacterial properties .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it ,COMMA you know ,COMMA tickled a little bit and it smelled good ,COMMA but I have to say that nobody here has complimented me on the cleanliness of my face today .PERIOD <BREAK>
These ones GQ did spring for -- I own these -- but I will tell you ,COMMA not only did I not get a compliment from any of you ,COMMA I have not gotten a compliment from anybody in the months that I have owned and worn these .PERIOD <BREAK>
And then an enzyme in its digestive tract leeches into the beans ,COMMA and people with the unenviable job of collecting these cats' leavings then go through the forest collecting the ,COMMA you know ,COMMA results and processing it into coffee -- although you actually can buy it in the unprocessed form .PERIOD <BREAK>
But anyway ,COMMA we had a great night's sleep .PERIOD <BREAK>
And you spend a third of your life in bed .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is Tom Cruise arriving at the Mission :COLON Impossible III premiere .PERIOD <BREAK>
When he tries to open the door ,COMMA you could call it Mission :COLON Impossible IV .PERIOD <BREAK>
There was one object that I could not get my hands on ,COMMA and that was the 1947 Cheval Blanc .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it was an invitation you do not refuse .PERIOD <BREAK>
Earlier this year ,COMMA a virtual asteroid in it sold for 330000 real dollars .PERIOD <BREAK>
And this is a Titan class ship in the space game ,COMMA EVE Online .PERIOD <BREAK>
It gives you great powers .PERIOD <BREAK>
Your ambition is satisfied ,COMMA but it's very beautiful .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so these combine to form a very intense emotional engagement .PERIOD <BREAK>
But this isn't the really interesting stuff .PERIOD <BREAK>
The really interesting stuff about virtuality is what you can measure with it .PERIOD <BREAK>
The game's just trying to get people to open about a million boxes ,COMMA getting better and better stuff in them .PERIOD <BREAK>
This sounds immensely boring but games are able to make this process incredibly compelling .PERIOD <BREAK>
But we don't just have pies in the boxes .PERIOD <BREAK>
And also ,COMMA we say ,COMMA Well ,COMMA how many monsters ?QUESTIONMARK Should I have the entire world full of a billion monsters ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
They're not rational about probability .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's not giving me my last two pies .PERIOD I'm going to give up .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the point is really that we evolved to be satisfied by the world in particular ways .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA you give people lots and lots of different tasks .PERIOD <BREAK>
Third ,COMMA you reward effort .PERIOD <BREAK>
And something very exciting is just beginning to happen in places like the University of Bristol in the UK ,COMMA where we are beginning to be able to model mathematically dopamine levels in the brain .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the success rate is at close to 100 percent .PERIOD <BREAK>
Let's start with business .PERIOD <BREAK>
But each bag we'd sell would provide a year's worth of school meals for one kid .PERIOD <BREAK>
All this time you're -- when you think about hunger ,COMMA it's a hard thing to think about ,COMMA because what we think about is eating .PERIOD <BREAK>
There's definitely hunger in America :COLON 49 million people and almost 167 million children .PERIOD <BREAK>
Hunger definitely means something a little bit different in America than it does internationally ,COMMA but it's incredibly important to address hunger in our own country .PERIOD <BREAK>
Well ,COMMA they're both about food .PERIOD <BREAK>
And you know ,COMMA the reality is that between farmers in America ,COMMA who actually ,COMMA quite frankly ,COMMA when I spend time in the Midwest ,COMMA are pretty large in general .PERIOD <BREAK>
So the problematic food system is affecting both hunger and obesity .PERIOD <BREAK>
Not to beat a dead horse ,COMMA but this is a global food system where there's a billion people hungry and billion people obese .PERIOD <BREAK>
And how are we going to get those kids those nutritious foods ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Another thing that's become incredibly global is production of meat and fish .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we were going to do something that was horrible for the profession .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that the incredible amount of effort to deliver those sketches for years and years and years is not only something to be derided ,COMMA but we would merely write it off as merely execution .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA there are all kinds of things that we architects need to learn how to do ,COMMA like managing contracts ,COMMA learning how to write contracts ,COMMA understanding procurement processes ,COMMA understanding the time value of money and cost estimation .PERIOD <BREAK>
Take joint positions with your client .PERIOD <BREAK>
Why was this horrible little building so important to their renown and their innovation ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Because they could do whatever they wanted to to this building .PERIOD <BREAK>
The architectural manifestation was frankly just dumb .PERIOD <BREAK>
In fact it really was the clients who had to do it .PERIOD <BREAK>
They had to make a decision ,COMMA based on the positions we took to redefine the budget being from two thirds capital-A architecture and one-third infrastructure ,COMMA to actually the inverse ,COMMA two-thirds infrastructure and one-third capital-A architecture .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA that theater machine has ability to move between a whole series of configurations at the push of a button and a few stagehands in a short amount of time .PERIOD <BREAK>
But it also has the potential to not only provide multiform but multi-processional sequences .PERIOD <BREAK>
And some of the seats need to actually change their direction ,COMMA and change their rake ,COMMA to allow that to happen .PERIOD <BREAK>
There you see it's the side balconies for the proscenium .PERIOD <BREAK>
Meaning ,COMMA nothing that we do can we be the first ones to do it .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA if I'll take you through -- this is an early concept sketch -- take you through kind of a mixture of all these things together .PERIOD <BREAK>
You would be allowed to bring objects or performers into the performing chamber :COLON Aida ,COMMA their elephants ,COMMA you can bring the elephants in .PERIOD <BREAK>
Et voila .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is the AT&ampT Performing Arts Center's Dee and Charles Wyly Theater .PERIOD <BREAK>
But we got to that conclusion without understanding where we were going ,COMMA what we knew were a series of issues that the company and the client was confronted with .PERIOD <BREAK>
So this is a picture of me holding one of the first watercolor paintings I ever made .PERIOD <BREAK>
I have many of these books ,COMMA and I've been keeping them for about the last eight or nine years .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I really loved this idea of the partial glimpse into somebody's life .PERIOD <BREAK>
As opposed to knowing the whole story ,COMMA just knowing a little bit of the story ,COMMA and then letting your own mind fill in the rest .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is a project that scans the world's newly posted blog entries every two or three minutes ,COMMA searching for occurrences of the phrases I feel and I am feeling .PERIOD And when it finds one of those phrases ,COMMA it grabs the full sentence up to the period and also tries to identify demographic information about the author .PERIOD <BREAK>
And when that happens ,COMMA these montage compositions are automatically created ,COMMA which consist of the sentence and images being combined .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'm 23 ,COMMA and a recovering meth and heroin addict ,COMMA and feel absolutely blessed to still be alive .PERIOD <BREAK>
I feel sassy .PERIOD <BREAK>
As you can see ,COMMA We Feel Fine collects very ,COMMA very small-scale personal stories .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA really even challenging the notion of what can be considered a story .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the Eskimo community basically camps out on the edge of the ice here ,COMMA waits for a whale to come close enough to attack .PERIOD And when it does ,COMMA it throws a harpoon at it ,COMMA and then hauls the whale up under the ice ,COMMA and cuts it up .PERIOD <BREAK>
They have colors .PERIOD What do they look like ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
This is in the Patkotak's family living room in their house in Barrow .PERIOD The boxed wine they served us .PERIOD <BREAK>
Cigarette break outside -- I don't smoke .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA you have some really happy person holding 10 balloons ,COMMA and some really sad soul holding one balloon .PERIOD <BREAK>
A 16 -year-old student .PERIOD <BREAK>
I asked her about that ,COMMA and she said she meant that she doesn't want to be married ,COMMA because ,COMMA in her opinion ,COMMA when you get married in Bhutan as a woman ,COMMA your chances to live an independent life kind of end ,COMMA and so she had no interest in that .PERIOD <BREAK>
A 37 -year-old road worker .PERIOD <BREAK>
His wish was to make some money and open a store .PERIOD <BREAK>
Finally ,COMMA this is a 26 -year-old nun I spoke to .PERIOD <BREAK>
I asked her a little bit more about the cave and what she planned would happen once she went there ,COMMA you know .PERIOD <BREAK>
Jonathan Harris :COLON Maybe you'll die ?QUESTIONMARK Woman :COLON Yes .PERIOD <BREAK>
Yeah ,COMMA but -- yeah ,COMMA OK .PERIOD Do you hope -- would you prefer to live in the cave for 40 years ,COMMA or to live for one year ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Woman :COLON Yes .PERIOD From then ,COMMA I'm going to the heaven .PERIOD <BREAK>
You can start to see some familiar balloons here .PERIOD <BREAK>
Thank you .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA the approach that we took was the other way around .PERIOD <BREAK>
What you see here is a prototypic device .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's made of paper and paper ,COMMA of course ,COMMA wicks fluid ,COMMA as you know ,COMMA paper ,COMMA cloth -- drop wine on the tablecloth ,COMMA and the wine wicks all over everything .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA the production capability is there .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the procedure that we have is simply to start with paper .PERIOD <BREAK>
You can't manipulate it very well ,COMMA although I'll show something about that in a moment .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA you take the drop of blood ,COMMA no further manipulations ,COMMA you put it on a little device ,COMMA the device filters out the blood cells ,COMMA lets the serum go through ,COMMA and you get a series of colors down in the bottom there .PERIOD <BREAK>
Turns out to work actually quite well ,COMMA particularly when your color printer has printed the color bars that indicate how things work .PERIOD <BREAK>
I don't know whether the idea of one computer ,COMMA one child makes any sense .PERIOD Here's the computer of the future ,COMMA because this screen is already there and they're ubiquitous .PERIOD <BREAK>
The answer is that what you do ,COMMA and the details are not terribly important here ,COMMA is to make something more elaborate :COLON You take several different layers of paper ,COMMA each one containing its own little fluid system ,COMMA and you separate them by pieces of ,COMMA literally ,COMMA double-sided carpet tape ,COMMA the stuff you use to stick the carpets onto the floor .PERIOD <BREAK>
But that is ,COMMA in principle ,COMMA the way you solve the fever of unexplained origin problem ,COMMA because each one of those spots then becomes a test for a particular set of markers of disease ,COMMA and this will work in due course .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA I have one last ,COMMA two last little stories to tell you ,COMMA in finishing off this business .PERIOD <BREAK>
We were very proud of this ,COMMA particularly the title ,COMMA which was Eggbeater as Centrifuge .PERIOD <BREAK>
We all struggled for an entire day to think about simplicity .PERIOD <BREAK>
Why are we spending $ 135 billion ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
In the fourth act ,COMMA with our hubris ,COMMA our overconfidence developing ,COMMA we invaded Iraq and Afghanistan ,COMMA and in the fifth act ,COMMA we plunged into a humiliating mess .PERIOD <BREAK>
When I walked across Afghanistan in the winter of 2001 - 2002 ,COMMA what I saw was scenes like this .PERIOD <BREAK>
In Sangin where I was sick in 2002 ,COMMA the nearest health clinic was within three days walk .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the same is true for the troops .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the reason I'm looking a little bit perplexed in this photograph is I was somewhat frightened ,COMMA and I was too afraid on this occasion to ask him ,COMMA having run for an hour through the desert and taken refuge in this house ,COMMA why he had turned up and wanted to have his photograph taken with me .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now this is not to say Afghanistan is a place full of people like Mullah Mustafa .PERIOD <BREAK>
I ran a center at Harvard from 2008 to 2010 ,COMMA and there were people like Michael Semple there who speak Afghan languages fluently ,COMMA who've traveled to almost every district in the country .PERIOD <BREAK>
You feel deep ,COMMA deep guilt .PERIOD <BREAK>
The average British soldier is on a tour of only six months ;SEMICOLON Italian soldiers ,COMMA on tours of four months ;SEMICOLON the American military ,COMMA on tours of 12 months .PERIOD <BREAK>
So we need to change that institutional culture .PERIOD <BREAK>
Secondly ,COMMA we need to aim off of the optimism of the generals .PERIOD <BREAK>
Borders between the Bosniak territory and the Bosnian-Serb territory have calmed down .PERIOD <BREAK>
If what we're interested in is regional stability ,COMMA Egypt is far more important .PERIOD <BREAK>
Just briefly ,COMMA what's your take on the current events there and the intervention ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
What we should have done in Libya is we should have stuck to the UN .PERIOD resolution .PERIOD <BREAK>
For the first time in the United States ,COMMA a predominantly white group of voters voted for an African-American candidate for President .PERIOD <BREAK>
But really the question here -- Obama did relatively well in Kansas .PERIOD <BREAK>
Actually we didn't ask them ,COMMA but when they conducted exit polls in every state ,COMMA in 37 states ,COMMA out of the 50 ,COMMA they asked a question ,COMMA that was pretty direct ,COMMA about race .PERIOD <BREAK>
And they ask a series of really interesting questions .PERIOD <BREAK>
But you see Democrats versus Republican ,COMMA not a big difference based on who your neighbors are .PERIOD <BREAK>
And likewise they asked ,COMMA not in 2000 ,COMMA but in the same survey in 1996 ,COMMA Would you not vote for a qualified black president ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
I'm a big fan of cities .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it was followed a year or two later by Laennec discovering the stethoscope .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's been on calendars ,COMMA postage stamps in many different countries .PERIOD <BREAK>
I call it the iPatient .PERIOD <BREAK>
They understood her breast cancer at the molecular level ;SEMICOLON they had no need to touch her breasts .PERIOD <BREAK>
But to her ,COMMA it mattered deeply .PERIOD <BREAK>
We marry ,COMMA for example ,COMMA with great pomp and ceremony and expense to signal our departure from a life of solitude and misery and loneliness to one of eternal bliss .PERIOD <BREAK>
I would feel the abdomen .PERIOD <BREAK>
I remember so many huge ,COMMA hollowed out ,COMMA haunted eyes staring up at me as I performed this ritual .PERIOD <BREAK>
It was an offering ,COMMA an invitation .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's the -- it's produced by the Quadro Corporation of West Virginia .PERIOD <BREAK>
You could dowse for all sorts of things ,COMMA but this particular one was built to dowse for marijuana in students' lockers .PERIOD <BREAK>
So the way it works is ,COMMA you go down the hallway and you see if it tilts toward a particular locker ,COMMA and then you open the locker .PERIOD <BREAK>
No ,COMMA it -- well ,COMMA it has kind of a right-leaning bias .PERIOD <BREAK>
You can say a miracle occurs .PERIOD <BREAK>
Whereas -- and it's true ,COMMA scientists sometimes throw terms out as linguistic place fillers -- dark energy or dark matter or something like that -- until we figure out what it is ,COMMA we'll just call it this -- it's the beginning of the causal chain for science .PERIOD <BREAK>
You don't even need Photoshop ;SEMICOLON you don't need high-tech equipment ;SEMICOLON you don't need computers .PERIOD <BREAK>
In the case of Galileo ,COMMA he had two problems when he turned his telescope to Saturn .PERIOD <BREAK>
And this is what he ended up concluding that he saw .PERIOD <BREAK>
So without a theory of planetary rings and with only grainy data ,COMMA you can't have a good theory .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it wasn't solved until 1655 .PERIOD <BREAK>

Someone stands up and says ,COMMA This one is important .PERIOD <BREAK>
Because if you're not upsetting anyone ,COMMA you're not changing the status quo .PERIOD <BREAK>
Because focusing on that part of it -- not the mechanics of what you're building ,COMMA but the who ,COMMA and the leading part -- is where change comes .PERIOD <BREAK>
So here is what leaders have in common .PERIOD The first thing is ,COMMA they challenge the status quo .PERIOD <BREAK>
The second thing is ,COMMA they build a culture .PERIOD <BREAK>

And to my mind ,COMMA those are pretty wise words ,COMMA no matter what your creed .PERIOD Thank you .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is Tootsie's Orchid Lounge in Nashville .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the size of the room is not that big .PERIOD <BREAK>
He wanted a bigger band .PERIOD <BREAK>

Now there's venues like this ,COMMA a discotheque ,COMMA and there's jukeboxes in bars ,COMMA where you don't even need to have a band .PERIOD <BREAK>
And ,COMMA as with jazz ,COMMA the dancers liked certain sections more than they did others .PERIOD <BREAK>
So that doesn't really work .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it turns out that a sound like this is the most energy efficient and practical way to transmit their call across the fields and savannahs .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's adaptive .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I'm saying ,COMMA well ,COMMA the passion's still there ,COMMA but the vessel that it's going to be injected into and poured into ,COMMA that is instinctively and intuitively created first .PERIOD <BREAK>
We sing .PERIOD <BREAK>

This is a real rural village .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now that was the advice that St .PERIOD Benedict gave his rather startled followers in the fifth century .PERIOD <BREAK>
Up until that moment ,COMMA I had been that classic corporate warrior -- I was eating too much ,COMMA I was drinking too much ,COMMA I was working too hard and I was neglecting the family .PERIOD <BREAK>

And ,COMMA in the fall ,COMMA I'm actually going to -- I exchange marriage vows with my beloved .PERIOD Thank you very much .PERIOD <BREAK>
One out of four South Bronx children has asthma .PERIOD <BREAK>
Residents were often given less than a month's notice before their buildings were razed .PERIOD <BREAK>
The common perception was that only pimps and pushers and prostitutes were from the South Bronx .PERIOD <BREAK>
And luckily for me ,COMMA that home and the love inside of it ,COMMA along with help from teachers ,COMMA mentors and friends along the way ,COMMA was enough .PERIOD <BREAK>
Are these factors taken into consideration when land-use policy is decided ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Once we realized that ,COMMA we decided it was time to do our own planning .PERIOD <BREAK>
Anyway ,COMMA I know Chris told us not to do pitches up here ,COMMA but since I have all of your attention :COLON we need investors .PERIOD End of pitch .PERIOD <BREAK>
Anyway -- OK .PERIOD Katrina .PERIOD Prior to Katrina ,COMMA the South Bronx and New Orleans' Ninth Ward had a lot in common .PERIOD Both were largely populated by poor people of color ,COMMA both hotbeds of cultural innovation :COLON think hip-hop and jazz .PERIOD <BREAK>
In the post-Katrina era ,COMMA we have still more in common .PERIOD <BREAK>
Neither the destruction of the Ninth Ward nor the South Bronx was inevitable .PERIOD <BREAK>
At present ,COMMA that's not happening in New York City .PERIOD <BREAK>
And although less than 25 percent of South Bronx residents own cars ,COMMA these projects include thousands of new parking spaces ,COMMA yet zip in terms of mass public transit .PERIOD <BREAK>
I do have a problem with developments that hyper-exploit politically vulnerable communities for profit .PERIOD <BREAK>
But one of the things I do to remind myself of greater possibilities is to learn from visionaries in other cities .PERIOD <BREAK>
He looked at the demographics .PERIOD <BREAK>
His administration narrowed key municipal thoroughfares from five lanes to three ,COMMA outlawed parking on those streets ,COMMA expanded pedestrian walkways and bike lanes ,COMMA created public plazas ,COMMA created one of the most efficient bus mass-transit systems in the entire world .PERIOD <BREAK>
I don't think he understood that I wasn't asking for funding .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is more or less what we saw last year ,COMMA and this is how it will go on into the future .PERIOD <BREAK>
Because you see now ,COMMA I presented statistics that don't exist .PERIOD <BREAK>
And this is GDP per capita on this axis .PERIOD <BREAK>
The last century ,COMMA 1870 ,COMMA was bad for the kids in Europe ,COMMA because most of this statistics is Europe .PERIOD <BREAK>
And this is the United States moving away here ,COMMA earning more money .PERIOD <BREAK>
Let us have a look at the United States .PERIOD <BREAK>
Within some years Chile may have better child survival than the United States .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's the part where I sold the Volvo and bought the Toyota .PERIOD <BREAK>
And now we can see that the rate of change was enormous in Japan .PERIOD <BREAK>
Sweden was like Ghana .PERIOD <BREAK>
Because I have to show you one of the other facilities .PERIOD <BREAK>
We can also make the color here represent the variable -- and what am I choosing here ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And there we are ,COMMA 2001 .PERIOD <BREAK>
The world is quite a messy place .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is two to five dollars .PERIOD You have a bed .PERIOD <BREAK>
I lectured on this for Ikea ,COMMA and they wanted to see the sofa immediately here .PERIOD <BREAK>
I would say that sub-Saharan Africa has done best in the world during the last 50 years .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that's good ,COMMA it gets two plusses .PERIOD <BREAK>
Environment is very ,COMMA very crucial .PERIOD <BREAK>
Of course ,COMMA it's human rights .PERIOD <BREAK>
And culture .PERIOD Culture is the most important thing ,COMMA I would say ,COMMA because that's what brings joy to life .PERIOD <BREAK>
Even African countries can achieve this .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's a cultural expression that for thousands of years has inspired human beings to think beyond the obvious .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so cars ,COMMA as art ,COMMA brings it into an emotional plane -- if you accept that -- that you have to deal with on the same level you would with art with a capital A .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now at this point you're going to see a picture of Michelangelo .PERIOD <BREAK>
Automobiles are self-moving things ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK Elevators are automobiles .PERIOD <BREAK>
Cars are a sculpture -- did you know this ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
OK ,COMMA it's not marketing ;SEMICOLON there's a very interesting car concept here ,COMMA but the marketing part is not what I want to talk about here .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's that will to live ,COMMA that need to survive ,COMMA to express itself ,COMMA that comes in a car ,COMMA and takes over people like me .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we tell other people ,COMMA Do this ,COMMA do this ,COMMA do this ,COMMA until this thing comes alive .PERIOD <BREAK>
We are completely infected .PERIOD And beauty can be the result of this infectiousness ;SEMICOLON it's quite wonderful .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA now I get to the point .PERIOD I want to talk about cars as art .PERIOD <BREAK>
We're not trying to find vanity and beauty .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that sometimes leads to bit of a divergence in why we're doing what we're doing .PERIOD <BREAK>
Toothbrush ,COMMA cool .PERIOD <BREAK>
I heard today about Joseph's death genes that have to go in and kill cell reproduction .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is very difficult ,COMMA and you have to have a bond with your team that permits you to do this ,COMMA because their life is wrapped up in that too .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is 1996 we did this project .PERIOD And so we sent them off with this team name ,COMMA Deep Blue .PERIOD Now many people know Deep Blue from IBM -- we actually stole it from them because we figured if anybody read our faxes they'd think we're talking about computers .PERIOD <BREAK>
And a group of engineers worked in Germany ,COMMA and the idea was they would work separately on this problem of what's the successor to the SUV .PERIOD <BREAK>
They would come together ,COMMA compare notes .PERIOD Then they would work apart ,COMMA come together ,COMMA and they would produce together a monumental set of diverse opinions that didn't pollute each other's ideas -- but at the same time came together and resolved the problems .PERIOD <BREAK>
The bathroom was so big ,COMMA she built the bed over the bathtub -- it's quite fascinating .PERIOD <BREAK>
Well ,COMMA what I didn't know was ,COMMA and what we found out was -- these guys ,COMMA they can't even like talk to each other under those conditions .PERIOD <BREAK>
There was a whole lot of dialog .PERIOD <BREAK>
We spent four hours being told all about vocabulary that needs to be built between engineers and designers .PERIOD <BREAK>
Dialog kept on going ,COMMA with mental maps of words ,COMMA and pretty soon it was becoming obvious that instead of being dazzled with brilliance ,COMMA I was seriously being baffled with bullshit .PERIOD <BREAK>
Because of course they didn't tell us that they had three station wagons full of drawings ,COMMA model concepts ,COMMA pictures -- everything I wanted ,COMMA they'd locked up in the cars ,COMMA because they had shown solidarity with the engineers -- and they'd decided not to show me anything ,COMMA in order to give the chance for problem solving a chance to start ,COMMA because they hadn't realized ,COMMA of course ,COMMA that they couldn't do problem creating .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's true that the trust and the love ,COMMA that makes it worthwhile .PERIOD <BREAK>
We didn't sequence his genome .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the reason is that cancer ,COMMA like every cell in the body ,COMMA places little molecular bookmarks ,COMMA little Post-it notes ,COMMA that remind the cell I'm cancer ;SEMICOLON I should keep growing .PERIOD <BREAK>
We just started mailing it to our friends .PERIOD <BREAK>
And as we treat it with our compound ,COMMA this addiction to sugar ,COMMA this rapid growth ,COMMA faded .PERIOD <BREAK>
And in fact ,COMMA this molecule prevents this adipocyte ,COMMA this fat stem cell ,COMMA from remembering how to make fat such that mice on a high fat diet ,COMMA like the folks in my hometown of Chicago ,COMMA fail to develop fatty liver ,COMMA which is a major medical problem .PERIOD <BREAK>
This molecule will soon leave our benches and go into a small startup company called Tensha Therapeutics .PERIOD <BREAK>
I've never seen really anywhere this unique support for cancer research .PERIOD <BREAK>
The age of the universe ,COMMA between now and the Big Bang ,COMMA is a hundred billion in dog years .PERIOD <BREAK>
If you looked at one of these galaxies and measured its velocity ,COMMA it would be moving away from you .PERIOD <BREAK>
And if you look at a galaxy even farther away ,COMMA it would be moving away faster .PERIOD <BREAK>
That kind of makes sense to us .PERIOD <BREAK>
The air in this room is very smooth .PERIOD <BREAK>
In particular ,COMMA things were a lot denser .PERIOD <BREAK>
What you have to think about is we have a universe with a hundred billion galaxies ,COMMA a hundred billion stars each .PERIOD <BREAK>
We'd like to understand that .PERIOD <BREAK>
One of the people who did understand that this was a problem was Richard Feynman .PERIOD <BREAK>
The arrow of time cannot be completely understood until the mystery of the beginnings of the history of the universe are reduced still further from speculation to understanding .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's not true that we've figured it out by now .PERIOD <BREAK>
The reason the problem has gotten worse ,COMMA rather than better ,COMMA is because in 1998 we learned something crucial about the universe that we didn't know before .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so even though the universe will last forever ,COMMA and ordinary matter and radiation will dilute away ,COMMA there will always be some radiation ,COMMA some thermal fluctuations ,COMMA even in empty space .PERIOD <BREAK>
It will probably increase ,COMMA and the probability is enormously huge .PERIOD <BREAK>
Remember ,COMMA life itself depends on the arrow of time .PERIOD <BREAK>
Occasionally ,COMMA you will make a planet or a star or a galaxy or a hundred billion galaxies .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now your homework assignment is to really think about this ,COMMA to contemplate what it means .PERIOD <BREAK>
I just showed you this picture .PERIOD <BREAK>
They all happen over a period of time equal to 10 to the 10 to the 120 years .PERIOD <BREAK>
So here's two questions for you .PERIOD <BREAK>
Maybe there is something that naturally ,COMMA through the growth of the laws of physics ,COMMA gives rise to universe like ours in low entropy configurations .PERIOD <BREAK>
My bold speculation is that I will be absolutely vindicated by history .PERIOD <BREAK>
And 50 years from now ,COMMA all of my current wild ideas will be accepted as truths by the scientific and external communities .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is a prediction .PERIOD I might be wrong .PERIOD <BREAK>
I would like to share that story today .PERIOD <BREAK>
Like everyone else ,COMMA we grew maize .PERIOD <BREAK>
I felt very happy to be at the secondary school ,COMMA so I was determined to do anything possible to receive education .PERIOD <BREAK>
So I went to a library .PERIOD <BREAK>
So I would like to say something to all the people out there like me to the Africans ,COMMA and the poor who are struggling with your dreams .PERIOD <BREAK>
God bless .PERIOD <BREAK>
Unlike most of our computing devices ,COMMA these objects are much more fun to use .PERIOD <BREAK>
A gesture of Namaste ,COMMA maybe ,COMMA to respect someone ,COMMA or maybe -- in India I don't need to teach a kid that this means four runs in cricket .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA I was interested in these two rollers ,COMMA and I actually wanted more ,COMMA so I borrowed another mouse from a friend -- never returned to him -- and I now had four rollers .PERIOD <BREAK>
What I got is basically a gesture interface device that actually acts as a motion-sensing device made for two dollars .PERIOD <BREAK>
What we are interested in is information .PERIOD <BREAK>
So I thought ,COMMA around last year -- in the beginning of the last year -- I started thinking ,COMMA Why can I not take this approach in the reverse way ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
But later ,COMMA I realized that I actually wanted to interact with those digital pixels ,COMMA also .PERIOD <BREAK>
You stop by a wall ,COMMA and start painting on that wall .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA technically ,COMMA it's a little bit complex ,COMMA but it gives you an output which is more intuitive to use ,COMMA in some sense .PERIOD <BREAK>
Rather than getting your camera out of your pocket ,COMMA you can just do the gesture of taking a photo and it takes a photo for you .PERIOD <BREAK>
Once it has that information ,COMMA it finds out more reviews about that ,COMMA or maybe New York Times has a sound overview on that ,COMMA so you can actually hear ,COMMA on a physical book ,COMMA a review as sound .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA I was seeing the live [video] of his talk ,COMMA outside ,COMMA on just a newspaper .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA what I did here is remove the camera -- All the webcam cameras have a microphone inside the camera .PERIOD <BREAK>
and I am a Wilderness Explorer in Tribe 54 ) And you can of course play games .PERIOD <BREAK>
Yeah .PERIOD And I say ,COMMA OK ,COMMA this looks nice ,COMMA let me print it out ,COMMA that thing .PERIOD <BREAK>
Thank you .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is incredible ,COMMA really .PERIOD <BREAK>
And now ,COMMA if you see ,COMMA it's more about the cost-effectiveness :COLON this system costs you $ 300 compared to the $ 20000 surface tables ,COMMA or anything like that .PERIOD <BREAK>
Or maybe even the $ 2 mouse gesture system at that time was costing around $ 5000 ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
No ,COMMA this theory comes from an expert on barnacles and worms and pigeon breeding ,COMMA and you know who I mean :COLON Charles Darwin .PERIOD <BREAK>
Taste for both natural beauty and for the arts travel across cultures with great ease .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA I personally have no doubt whatsoever that the experience of beauty ,COMMA with its emotional intensity and pleasure ,COMMA belongs to our evolved human psychology .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA keeping these ideas firmly in mind ,COMMA we can say that the experience of beauty is one of the ways that evolution has of arousing and sustaining interest or fascination ,COMMA even obsession ,COMMA in order to encourage us toward making the most adaptive decisions for survival and reproduction .PERIOD <BREAK>
Beauty is nature's way of acting at a distance ,COMMA so to speak .PERIOD <BREAK>
Consider briefly an important source of aesthetic pleasure ,COMMA the magnetic pull of beautiful landscapes .PERIOD <BREAK>
Their symmetry ,COMMA their attractive materials and ,COMMA above all ,COMMA their meticulous workmanship are simply quite beautiful to our eyes ,COMMA even today .PERIOD <BREAK>
Competently made hand axes indicated desirable personal qualities -- intelligence ,COMMA fine motor control ,COMMA planning ability ,COMMA conscientiousness and sometimes access to rare materials .PERIOD <BREAK>
So before I talk about this car for the blind ,COMMA let me briefly tell you about another project that I worked on called the DARPA Urban Challenge .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now this was about building a robotic car that can drive itself .PERIOD <BREAK>
So it's a small tablet ,COMMA has many holes in it ,COMMA and compressed air comes out ,COMMA so it can actually draw images .PERIOD <BREAK>
And he's [unclear] following that van that's out in front of him .PERIOD <BREAK>
So since we started this project ,COMMA we've been getting hundreds of letters ,COMMA emails ,COMMA phone calls from people from all around the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
But potentially more important than this is the tremendous value of the spin-off technology that can come from this project .PERIOD <BREAK>
Why do we call it that ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
I don't know ,COMMA Taiwan Straits 2025 .PERIOD <BREAK>
Let's talk about an enemy embedded within that battle space .PERIOD <BREAK>
They said we couldn't do Iraq .PERIOD <BREAK>
You have to create internal partners .PERIOD You have to access coalition partners .PERIOD <BREAK>
We asked the Russians for 40000 .PERIOD <BREAK>
They said no .PERIOD <BREAK>
Like Saddam ,COMMA like Mugabe ,COMMA like Kim Jong-Il -- people who kill in hundreds of thousands or millions .PERIOD <BREAK>
Like the 250000 dead so far in Sudan .PERIOD <BREAK>
And let's call this red line ,COMMA I don't know ,COMMA mission accomplished .PERIOD <BREAK>
What we need downstream is a great power enabled -- what I call that Sys Admin Force .PERIOD <BREAK>
You've got to track coalition partners .PERIOD Create a record of success .PERIOD <BREAK>
So they start moving from reality towards desire and they create their own special language to describe their voyage of self-discovery and self-actualization .PERIOD <BREAK>
We bought one military and we operated another .PERIOD <BREAK>
I used to give this brief inside the Pentagon in the early 1990 s .PERIOD <BREAK>
Bad Pentagon ,COMMA bad !EXCLAMATIONMARK <BREAK>
It elevates MOOTW -- how we pronounce that acronym -- from crap to grand strategy ,COMMA because that's how you're going to shrink that gap .PERIOD <BREAK>
A Department of War ,COMMA a Department of Everything Else .PERIOD <BREAK>
Our long-term rationale becomes ,COMMA we're involved in a hair trigger stand off with the Soviets .PERIOD <BREAK>
The question is how do we reconnect American national security with global security to make the world a lot more comfortable ,COMMA and to embed and contextualize our employment of force around the planet ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Just be grateful Robert Reed didn't shove that bomb up his ass .PERIOD <BREAK>
I love this force .PERIOD I don't want to see it go .PERIOD <BREAK>
What does this mean in terms of operations ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
The force on the right ,COMMA in and out .PERIOD <BREAK>
The force on the right's going to obliterate it .PERIOD <BREAK>
Different definitions of network centricity .PERIOD <BREAK>
But ultimately you're going to civilianize it ,COMMA probably two thirds .PERIOD <BREAK>
But you need lots of these guys on the ground to win the peace .PERIOD <BREAK>
The point about the trigger-pullers and Special Operations Command .PERIOD <BREAK>
See me now .PERIOD Don't talk about it later .PERIOD <BREAK>
The world is my playground .PERIOD <BREAK>
I want the rules to be as loose as possible .PERIOD <BREAK>
The town was burned down ;SEMICOLON it was in the middle of winter ,COMMA and it was a very ,COMMA very severe winter .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that's what we're going through at this time .PERIOD <BREAK>
I wanted to just talk for one minute about the future of biotechnology ,COMMA because I think I know very little about that -- I'm not a biologist -- so everything I know about it can be said in one minute .PERIOD <BREAK>
But that's hard to do .PERIOD Unfortunately ,COMMA the ice is thick .PERIOD <BREAK>
But we can look outside ,COMMA very cheaply and in a simple fashion .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the step from the ocean to the land was not easy ,COMMA but it happened .PERIOD <BREAK>
So they would have to have something like a reptilian skin .PERIOD <BREAK>
The sunlight in Jupiter ,COMMA on the satellites of Jupiter ,COMMA is 25 times fainter than it is here ,COMMA since Jupiter is five times as far from the Sun .PERIOD <BREAK>
This was -- originally ,COMMA when radio astronomy began ,COMMA Mr .PERIOD Jansky ,COMMA at the Bell labs ,COMMA detected radio waves coming from the sky .PERIOD <BREAK>
Since there was nothing there ,COMMA you might as well not look .PERIOD <BREAK>
There is something called pit lamping .PERIOD <BREAK>
So these creatures will be bright against the cold surroundings .PERIOD <BREAK>
I call these creatures sunflowers .PERIOD <BREAK>
If we don't find them ,COMMA then we can create them ourselves .PERIOD <BREAK>
In the long run ,COMMA of course ,COMMA it would also make it possible for us to move out there .PERIOD <BREAK>
But in the long run ,COMMA if there's no life there ,COMMA we create it ourselves .PERIOD <BREAK>
So again ,COMMA we have a big and wonderful future to look forward .PERIOD <BREAK>
Thank you .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I realized then I had to go to design school .PERIOD <BREAK>
or What's this Num Lock key for ?QUESTIONMARK You know ,COMMA that thing ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And I didn't want to be a colorist .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that allows me to check my timer discretely ,COMMA here ,COMMA without bending my elbow .PERIOD <BREAK>
And something a little bit more experimental :COLON this is a light fixture for Swarovski ,COMMA and what it does is ,COMMA it changes shape .PERIOD <BREAK>

And if anybody asks why you're carrying a condom ,COMMA you can just say you like the design .PERIOD <BREAK>
Much of my life has been a quest to get some answers to these questions .PERIOD <BREAK>
I was born and raised here in India ,COMMA and I learned from an early age to be deeply suspicious of the aunties and uncles who would bend down ,COMMA pat us on the head and then say to my parents with no problem at all ,COMMA Poor things .PERIOD You only have three daughters .PERIOD <BREAK>
Late that night ,COMMA I heard my mother begging my father ,COMMA Please do something Ramu .PERIOD Can't you intervene ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
This is tradition .PERIOD <BREAK>

Their path is their own and it looks towards an Afghanistan that will be different .PERIOD <BREAK>
Their repertoire includes the Croatian national anthem ,COMMA a Bosnian love song and Serbian duets .PERIOD <BREAK>
In the Middle Ages ,COMMA troubadours would travel across the land singing their tales and sharing their verses :COLON Lesbor travels through the Balkans like this ,COMMA singing ,COMMA connecting people divided by religion ,COMMA nationality and language .PERIOD <BREAK>
The world Layma Bowie was given was a world at war .PERIOD <BREAK>

In a now famous CNN clip ,COMMA you can see them sitting on the ground ,COMMA their arms linked .PERIOD <BREAK>
The police are called in to physically remove the women .PERIOD <BREAK>
And then you realize that by integrating aspects of tradition and community into their struggles ,COMMA women like Sakena and Leah and Layma -- but also women like Sonia Gandhi here in India and Michelle Bachelet in Chile and Shirin Ebadi in Iran -- are doing something else .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the first thing I wanted to do as a Muslim was go to Mecca and visit the Kaaba ,COMMA the holiest shrine of Islam .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I did that ;SEMICOLON I put on my ritualistic dress ;SEMICOLON I went to the holy mosque ;SEMICOLON I did my prayers ;SEMICOLON I observed all the rituals .PERIOD <BREAK>
In other words ,COMMA men and women were worshiping all together .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I think it's not an accident that you don't find this idea in the very origin of Islam .PERIOD <BREAK>
On the other hand ,COMMA the Westerners who look at Islamic culture and see some troubling aspects should not readily conclude that this is what Islam ordains .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the religious police imposes the supposed Islamic way of life on every citizen ,COMMA by force -- like women are forced to cover their heads -- wear the hijab ,COMMA the Islamic head cover .PERIOD <BREAK>
Let me give you an example :COLON in Turkey where I come from ,COMMA which is a very hyper-secular republic ,COMMA until very recently we used to have what I call secularism police ,COMMA which would guard the universities against veiled students .PERIOD <BREAK>
In other words ,COMMA they would force students to uncover their heads ,COMMA and I think forcing people to uncover their head is as tyrannical as forcing them to cover it .PERIOD <BREAK>
Which means that Muslims can ,COMMA today ,COMMA look at those things and say ,COMMA Well ,COMMA the core of our religion is here to stay with us .PERIOD <BREAK>
And even the very extreme forms of Islamism led to terrorism in the name of Islam -- which is actually a practice that I think is against Islam ,COMMA but some ,COMMA obviously ,COMMA extremists did not think that way .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I think the West ,COMMA at least some powers in the West ,COMMA particularly the United States ,COMMA made the mistake of supporting those secular dictators ,COMMA thinking that they were more helpful for their interests .PERIOD <BREAK>
Secondly ,COMMA in the past two decades ,COMMA thanks to globalization ,COMMA thanks to the market economy ,COMMA thanks to the rise of a middle-class ,COMMA we in Turkey see what I define as a rebirth of Islamic modernism .PERIOD <BREAK>
As a photographer for National Geographic ,COMMA I've portrayed it for many .PERIOD <BREAK>
And where that energy touches water ,COMMA something new emerges :COLON life .PERIOD <BREAK>
Shallow seas nurtured life early on ,COMMA and that's where it morphed into more complex forms .PERIOD <BREAK>
The fundamental forms of ferns followed ,COMMA to bear spores that foreshadowed seeds .PERIOD <BREAK>
Leatherbacks and tuataras are echoes from that era .PERIOD <BREAK>
Jurassic Park still shimmers in part of Madagascar ,COMMA and the center of Brazil ,COMMA where plants called cycads remain rock hard .PERIOD <BREAK>
Flamingos covered continents .PERIOD Migrations got underway .PERIOD <BREAK>
Water lilies were among the first .PERIOD <BREAK>
In Africa ,COMMA Gondwana molded Proteas .PERIOD <BREAK>
Tropical rainforests arose ,COMMA sparking new layers of interdependence .PERIOD <BREAK>
a trick shared by the largest flower on Earth .PERIOD <BREAK>
An asteroid hits ,COMMA and the world went down in flames .PERIOD <BREAK>
Primates emerge from jungles ,COMMA as tarsiers first ,COMMA becoming lemurs not much later .PERIOD <BREAK>
And you all here today can imagine and will shape where we go next .PERIOD <BREAK>
Today I want to talk to you about ethnic conflict and civil war .PERIOD <BREAK>
But let's start at the beginning .PERIOD <BREAK>
Well ,COMMA notwithstanding the gloomy pictures from the Middle East ,COMMA Darfur ,COMMA Iraq ,COMMA elsewhere ,COMMA there is a longer-term trend that does represent some good news .PERIOD <BREAK>
The news about civilian casualties is also less bad than it used to be .PERIOD <BREAK>
Thus ,COMMA even though every civilian killed ,COMMA maimed ,COMMA raped ,COMMA or tortured is one too many ,COMMA the fact that the number of civilian casualties is clearly lower today than it was a decade ago ,COMMA is good news .PERIOD <BREAK>
But let's look at the good news again .PERIOD <BREAK>
But then ,COMMA is Northern Ireland a unique example ,COMMA or does this kind of explanation only hold more generally in democratic and developed countries ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
A final example :COLON Kosovo .PERIOD <BREAK>
Central among them are three .PERIOD <BREAK>
By the same token -- and here we have some good news again -- the very fact that there is a high-level ,COMMA well-resourced international presence in Kosovo and the Balkans region more generally and the fact that local leaders on both sides have showed relative restraint ,COMMA explains why things have not been worse over the past two years since 2008 .PERIOD <BREAK>
A final thought :COLON Ending civil wars is a process that is fraught with dangers ,COMMA frustrations and setbacks .PERIOD <BREAK>
Thank you .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'm going to talk about some of my discoveries around the world through my work .PERIOD <BREAK>
And at that young age ,COMMA 10 years old ,COMMA Benki became the paje of his community .PERIOD <BREAK>
He went 3000 miles on an odyssey to Rio to the Earth Summit to tell the world what was happening in his tiny ,COMMA little corner .PERIOD <BREAK>
Benki came back to his village full of ideas -- new technologies ,COMMA new research ,COMMA new ways of understanding what was going on .PERIOD <BREAK>
He's built schools to teach children to care for the forest .PERIOD <BREAK>
Together ,COMMA he's led the reforestation of over 25 percent of the land that had been destroyed by the loggers .PERIOD <BREAK>
Why are you putting yourself at risk ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
So when I think of that ,COMMA I wonder what our grandchildren and our great-grandchildren ,COMMA when they ask themselves that question ,COMMA I wonder how they will answer .PERIOD <BREAK>
For me ,COMMA the world is veering towards a future we don't much want when we really think about it deep inside .PERIOD <BREAK>
You also know that we can't just keep doing what we've always done ,COMMA because we'll get the results we've always gotten .PERIOD <BREAK>
We have to change .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's imperative to me ,COMMA when I look around the world ,COMMA that we need to change ourselves .PERIOD <BREAK>
Sanghamitra didn't start life as a leader of an NGO ,COMMA she started her career as university professor ,COMMA teaching English literature .PERIOD <BREAK>
They take care of 20000 -odd people today in over 1000 villages around Karnataka .PERIOD <BREAK>
They've pioneered a different approach to villages .PERIOD <BREAK>
Instead of handing out information in pamphlets ,COMMA as is so often the case ,COMMA they bring theater troupes ,COMMA songs ,COMMA music ,COMMA dance .PERIOD <BREAK>
Sanghamitra told me just last week -- she had just come back from two weeks in the villages ,COMMA and she had a real breakthrough .PERIOD <BREAK>
He has nine other buildings -- that are already open to the public -- filled to the rafters with artifacts documenting contemporary Chinese history .PERIOD <BREAK>
They looked outside ,COMMA and then they changed what was on the inside .PERIOD <BREAK>
They've gone away from what they did before ,COMMA and they've gone to something they didn't know .PERIOD <BREAK>
He went around once ,COMMA he went around twice ,COMMA he went around thrice .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so ,COMMA when you study it ,COMMA you realize that different people of the world have a different understanding of the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
Perhaps he was a Jain monk ,COMMA like Bahubali over here ,COMMA the Gomateshwara Bahubali whose image is not far from Mysore .PERIOD <BREAK>
Alexander asked ,COMMA What are you doing ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And they both laughed .PERIOD <BREAK>
What should you not be ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
You should not be Sisyphus ,COMMA who rolls a rock up a mountain all day only to find the boulder rolled down at night .PERIOD <BREAK>
And he wanted to hoist his flag to say ,COMMA I was here first .PERIOD <BREAK>
This was the mythology of the gymnosophist .PERIOD <BREAK>
But they were not two characters on two different adventures .PERIOD <BREAK>
You see ,COMMA the Indians also had a river that separates the land of the living from the land of the dead .PERIOD <BREAK>
You go again and again and again .PERIOD <BREAK>
Two different mythologies ,COMMA two different ways of looking at the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I believe it is this mythological paradigm that inspired Indian mathematicians to discover the number zero .PERIOD <BREAK>
Who knows ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Standard business model :COLON vision ,COMMA mission ,COMMA values ,COMMA processes .PERIOD <BREAK>
You see ,COMMA this is what India is today .PERIOD The ground reality is based on a cyclical world view .PERIOD <BREAK>
I have personally experienced it .PERIOD I'm trained as a medical doctor .PERIOD <BREAK>
And he knew very intuitively ,COMMA that best practices ,COMMA developed in Japan and China and Europe and America will not work in India .PERIOD <BREAK>
You can't measure it .PERIOD You can't manage it .PERIOD <BREAK>
After a leader completes his training and is about to take over the store ,COMMA we blindfold him ,COMMA we surround him with the stakeholders ,COMMA the customer ,COMMA his family ,COMMA his team ,COMMA his boss .PERIOD <BREAK>
That sensitivity is what we need .PERIOD Once this belief enters ,COMMA behavior will happen ,COMMA business will happen .PERIOD <BREAK>
But that was interesting in itself .PERIOD This is companies like Vonage .PERIOD <BREAK>
The little box has your phone number .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's really cute seeing middle-aged people like me ,COMMA try out Skype for the first time ,COMMA which is usually when their kid goes away for a semester abroad .PERIOD <BREAK>
They don't want to pay the international fees ,COMMA so they're like ,COMMA Timmy !EXCLAMATIONMARK Is that you ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Imagine if you had an ordinary cell phone ,COMMA and any time you were in a wireless hotspot -- free calls anywhere in the world ,COMMA never pay the cellular company a nickel .PERIOD <BREAK>
And when you're out of the hotspot ,COMMA you're on the regular cellular network .PERIOD <BREAK>
You're thinking ,COMMA Well ,COMMA how often am I in a hotspot ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Because they give you a regular wireless router that works with the phone ,COMMA for your house .PERIOD <BREAK>
They don't have that kind of money .PERIOD Instead they give each of us a seven-dollar-and- 95 -cent box .PERIOD They're like a stealth tower installation program .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA I'm leaving the house .PERIOD DP :COLON I'm going for a walk -- do you mind ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
I don't know why my wife says I never listen to her .PERIOD I don't get that .PERIOD <BREAK>
I have two cellphones ,COMMA so this going to be very odd ,COMMA if it works .PERIOD <BREAK>
Excuse me one second .PERIOD <BREAK>
All right !EXCLAMATIONMARK We've made the point .PERIOD <BREAK>
The beauty of that is you never miss a call .PERIOD <BREAK>
Google bought it ,COMMA and they've been working on it for a year .PERIOD <BREAK>
I actually got a photograph of the Verizon employee right there .PERIOD <BREAK>
Anyway ,COMMA so lets say you need a drugstore near Chicago .PERIOD <BREAK>
Here it comes .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it's already written down -- so ,COMMA like ,COMMA if you're driving ,COMMA you don't have to do one of these things ,COMMA Uh huh ,COMMA uh huh ,COMMA uh huh .PERIOD <BREAK>
Shortly I'll tell you why I was in Milan .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's cute .PERIOD I do have an email address .PERIOD You can just ask me .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's absolutely phenomenal .PERIOD The only downside is that it requires you to know how to text -- send a text message .PERIOD Nobody over 40 knows how to do that .PERIOD <BREAK>
So I'm going to teach you something even better .PERIOD <BREAK>
They put this teeny-weeny little ad ,COMMA about 10 characters long .PERIOD <BREAK>
Because there is one !EXCLAMATIONMARK <BREAK>
As you can imagine ,COMMA it's college kids and old people .PERIOD <BREAK>
When I call to leave you a message ,COMMA I get 15 seconds of instructions from a third-grade teacher on Ambien !EXCLAMATIONMARK <BREAK>
So now I'm going to tell you how to get out of that .PERIOD <BREAK>
The reason I think that is that on the first day I tried one of these services ,COMMA I got two voicemail messages .PERIOD One was from a guy named Michael Stevenson ,COMMA which shouldn't be that hard to transcribe ,COMMA and it was misspelled .PERIOD <BREAK>
I love my job .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'm not kidding you .PERIOD The message said ,COMMA Was walking along the street and sky was blue and emergency !EXCLAMATIONMARK <BREAK>
And lastly ,COMMA I just have to talk about this one .PERIOD <BREAK>
Phone :COLON Well ,COMMA that's good .PERIOD <BREAK>
What are you doing ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Actually ,COMMA even so ,COMMA he was turned down by Verizon and others .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's got bad things and good things .PERIOD Lets all acknowledge that right now .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's absurd .PERIOD We have power outlets in every room of every building .PERIOD We have running water .PERIOD <BREAK>
You type in what you want ,COMMA and it gives you the translation .PERIOD <BREAK>
I know .PERIOD It's insane ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
It will immediately play you that song or that band .PERIOD <BREAK>
If you like that one ,COMMA or don't like it ,COMMA you do thumbs-up and thumbs-down .PERIOD Over time it tailors the songs so that it completely stops playing bad songs .PERIOD <BREAK>
It proposes a restaurant .PERIOD <BREAK>
And now the end is near .PERIOD <BREAK>
I want an iPhone .PERIOD <BREAK>
Who cares if it's AT&ampT ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Because the breast has become are very political organ .PERIOD <BREAK>
I will do my best this morning to tell you what I think is the truth .PERIOD <BREAK>
But first ,COMMA my disclosures .PERIOD <BREAK>
She came to see me after discovering a breast lump .PERIOD <BREAK>
You may recall a year ago when a firestorm erupted after the United States Preventive Services Task Force reviewed the world's mammography screening literature and issued a guideline recommending against screening mammograms in women in their 40 s .PERIOD <BREAK>
Screening the average young woman with an MRI is kind of like driving to the grocery store in a Hummer .PERIOD <BREAK>
But the problem was that the gamma detectors were these huge ,COMMA bulky tubes ,COMMA and they were filled with these scintillating crystals ,COMMA and you just couldn't get them close enough around the breast to find small tumors .PERIOD <BREAK>
To say that we faced high doses of skepticism in those early years is just a huge understatement ,COMMA but we were so convinced that we might be able to make this work that we chipped away with incremental modifications to this system .PERIOD <BREAK>
The patient receives an injection of a radio tracer that's taken up by rapidly proliferating tumor cells ,COMMA but not by normal cells ,COMMA and this is the key difference from mammography .PERIOD <BREAK>
Our big break came in 2004 .PERIOD <BREAK>
After we had demonstrated that we could find small tumors ,COMMA we used these images to submit a grant to the Susan G .PERIOD Komen Foundation .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we were elated when they took a chance on a team of completely unknown investigators and funded us to study 1000 women with dense breasts ,COMMA comparing a screening mammogram to an MBI .PERIOD <BREAK>
Here's an example from that screening study .PERIOD <BREAK>
It takes a radiologist years of specialty training to become expert in differentiating the normal anatomic detail from the worrisome finding .PERIOD <BREAK>
But I suspect even the non-radiologists in the room can find the tumor on the MBI image .PERIOD <BREAK>
After the fourth rejection ,COMMA we requested reconsideration of the manuscript ,COMMA because we strongly suspected that one of the reviewers who had rejected it had a financial conflict of interest in a competing technology .PERIOD <BREAK>
Some women who develop breast cancer die from it many years later ,COMMA and most women ,COMMA thankfully ,COMMA survive .PERIOD <BREAK>
So I worked with white noise .PERIOD <BREAK>
And do not be disturbed any more by the other aggressive sound .PERIOD <BREAK>
But it is just physiology .PERIOD It's just in your brain .PERIOD <BREAK>
So in order to make this white noise a little bit active and reactive ,COMMA I create a ball ,COMMA a rolling ball able to analyze and find where does aggressive sound come from ,COMMA and roll ,COMMA at home or at work ,COMMA towards aggressive noise ,COMMA and emits white noise in order to neutralize it .PERIOD <BREAK>
A loving dispute with your girl or boyfriend .PERIOD <BREAK>
Anyway ,COMMA in this same kind of approach ,COMMA I designed K .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'm just a designer .PERIOD So I need them .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the irony for me was of course ,COMMA I didn't do that for the sake of science progress .PERIOD <BREAK>
I just do that to make money .PERIOD <BREAK>
So we took too many of them .PERIOD <BREAK>
This one is an antibiotic .PERIOD <BREAK>
But in this case it is not the medication that is dependent on the patient .PERIOD <BREAK>
So the idea is ,COMMA all night long the elastic skin of the third lung will slowly inflate itself ,COMMA including air and molecules ,COMMA for sure .PERIOD <BREAK>
You have to know ,COMMA or you probably already know ,COMMA that indoor air pollution is more toxic than outdoor one .PERIOD <BREAK>
So while I'm talking to you ,COMMA the seats you are sit on are currently emitting some invisible and odorless toxic gas .PERIOD Sorry for that .PERIOD <BREAK>
So your sofa ,COMMA your plastic chair ,COMMA your kid's toys give their own invisible reality .PERIOD And this one is very toxic .PERIOD <BREAK>
This one is kind of the same approach because I include ,COMMA in a product like Andrea ,COMMA some plants .PERIOD <BREAK>
Indeed ,COMMA this object is a domestic farm ,COMMA for fishes and green .PERIOD <BREAK>
So the idea of this object is to be able to get at home very local food .PERIOD <BREAK>
After ,COMMA it goes back into the fish tank .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now we can eat local food .PERIOD <BREAK>
See ,COMMA like this one ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
You can see it there .PERIOD <BREAK>
We're the new technologists .PERIOD <BREAK>
I think about World War II -- some of our great technologists then ,COMMA some of our great physicists ,COMMA studying nuclear fission and fusion -- just nuclear stuff .PERIOD <BREAK>
We want the people building the technology thinking about what we should be doing with the technology .PERIOD <BREAK>
So we can protect ourselves if he was up to no good ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
So to get people warmed up ,COMMA let's start with an easy question -- something I'm sure everybody here has an opinion about :COLON iPhone versus Android .PERIOD <BREAK>
But he was worried that all we seem to be doing is trading opinions about this .PERIOD <BREAK>
In math ,COMMA we know the objective facts .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's an objective truth about the form of two ,COMMA the abstract form .PERIOD <BREAK>
Then you would know what was really just and what wasn't .PERIOD <BREAK>
If you think that way ,COMMA you have a Platonist moral framework .PERIOD <BREAK>
He thought it was impractical .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's just a matter of the consequences .PERIOD <BREAK>
Kant was very good on this point ,COMMA and he said it a little better than I'll say it .PERIOD <BREAK>
What should we be doing ?QUESTIONMARK What's the answer ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
There's not a formula .PERIOD <BREAK>
And don't just find another technologist friend ;SEMICOLON find somebody different than you .PERIOD <BREAK>
We care what happens in that opera .PERIOD <BREAK>
In the early ' 80 s ,COMMA some would say .PERIOD <BREAK>
The gang had no way to make money .PERIOD <BREAK>
So he was a math major in college who had a good heart ,COMMA and decided he wanted to get a sociology PhD ,COMMA came to the University of Chicago .PERIOD <BREAK>
And ,COMMA in his own words ,COMMA he looked like a freak .PERIOD <BREAK>
So he showed up at the University of Chicago .PERIOD <BREAK>
There was a lot of gunfire ;SEMICOLON there were a lot of philosophical discussions he had with the gang members .PERIOD <BREAK>
And you and I ,COMMA probably ,COMMA faced with the situation ,COMMA would think ,COMMA well ,COMMA I guess I'm going to write my dissertation on The Grateful Dead .PERIOD <BREAK>
But the thing that really makes the gang seem like McDonald's is its franchisees .PERIOD <BREAK>
So what do the wages look like ?QUESTIONMARK So you might be surprised .PERIOD <BREAK>
We found in our gang -- and ,COMMA admittedly ,COMMA this was not really sort of a standard situation ;SEMICOLON this was a time of intense violence -- of a lot of gang wars -- as this gang actually became quite successful .PERIOD But there were costs .PERIOD <BREAK>
That makes you pause -- gives you some pause -- those of you who believe that a death penalty's going to have an enormous deterrent effect on crime .PERIOD <BREAK>
That the young people controlled the gang -- that ,COMMA as you got older ,COMMA you dropped out of the gang .PERIOD <BREAK>
So what happened was ,COMMA the people who happened to be in the right place at the right time -- the people who happened to be leading the gang in the mid- to late ' 80 s -- became very ,COMMA very wealthy .PERIOD <BREAK>
You know ,COMMA he would say to his friends ,COMMA Hey ,COMMA look at all the money I got in the gang .PERIOD <BREAK>
Often ,COMMA our theories fail quite miserably when we go to the data .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is one of the basic ideas in labor economics ,COMMA called a compensating differential .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's why we think garbage men might be paid more than people who work in parks ,COMMA OK ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
So in the words of one of the members of the gang I think makes this clear .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the words of a gang member capture it quite nicely .PERIOD <BREAK>
If you start taking losses ,COMMA they see you as weak and shit .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I thought about it ,COMMA and I said ,COMMA CEOs often pay themselves million-dollar bonuses ,COMMA even when companies are losing a lot of money .PERIOD <BREAK>
Also different aerobatic maneuvers are possible with a paraglider .PERIOD <BREAK>
You can see the skydiver with the red suit ,COMMA he's in a stand-up position .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is a jump I did in Rio de Janeiro .PERIOD <BREAK>
2005 I did a BASE jump from the Eiger ,COMMA from the Monk and from the Jungfrau ,COMMA three very famous mountains in Switzerland .PERIOD <BREAK>
June Cohen :COLON I have some questions .PERIOD <BREAK>
Yet .PERIOD But people are trying .PERIOD Are you among those -- you're not going to commit -- are you among those trying to do it ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
It's a dream .PERIOD It's a dream .PERIOD Yeah .PERIOD <BREAK>
And is that how you usually fly ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Do people come to you with projects and say ,COMMA We want you to do this !EXCLAMATIONMARK <BREAK>
I don't necessarily think the film is so interesting .PERIOD <BREAK>
The show was ,COMMA in a sense ,COMMA about that .PERIOD <BREAK>
I also put a mirror in the ceiling ,COMMA and some fog ,COMMA some haze .PERIOD <BREAK>
And what happens is that people ,COMMA they start to see themselves in this space .PERIOD <BREAK>
What does it matter ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
It makes a difference whether you say ,COMMA I'm a part of this city .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's quite simple and fundamental .PERIOD <BREAK>
It doesn't really tell you what you're looking at .PERIOD <BREAK>
Or is that a three-hour hike ,COMMA or is that a whole day I'm looking at ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
If you have a waterfall in there ,COMMA right out there at the horizon ;SEMICOLON you look at the waterfall and you go ,COMMA Oh ,COMMA the water is falling really slowly .PERIOD <BREAK>
And experience is not just a kind of entertainment in a non-casual way .PERIOD <BREAK>
So art ,COMMA in that sense ,COMMA I think holds an incredible relevance in the world in which we're moving into ,COMMA particularly right now .PERIOD <BREAK>
What I really enjoyed about this project is reviving these people's words .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA what we're going to do next is a poem that was written by Nathalia Crane .PERIOD <BREAK>
The next poem is If No One Ever Marries Me .PERIOD <BREAK>
He went there after the death of his wife of smallpox and brought his two young children .PERIOD <BREAK>
Just bring it down a little .PERIOD <BREAK>
Thank you so much .PERIOD <BREAK>
Or this idea of the misunderstood genius ,COMMA frustrated that the world doesn't fit in with his or her ideas .PERIOD <BREAK>
And quite often we sit in a design meeting and we discover that there is this great idea .PERIOD <BREAK>
But for another client in another culture ,COMMA it could really be the right answer to a different question .PERIOD <BREAK>
And they chose this mascot because the theme of the expo is Better City ,COMMA Better Life .PERIOD <BREAK>
But then we looked at recent urban development ,COMMA and we noticed that this is like a Shanghai street ,COMMA 30 years ago .PERIOD All bikes ,COMMA no cars .PERIOD <BREAK>
So if you come to the expo ,COMMA go straight to the Danish pavilion ,COMMA get a Danish bike ,COMMA and then continue on that to visit the other pavilions .PERIOD <BREAK>
And in the middle of this sort of harbor bath ,COMMA we're actually going to put the actual Little Mermaid .PERIOD <BREAK>
So the second story that I'd like to tell is ,COMMA actually starts in my own house .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we discovered that by controlling the size of the holes ,COMMA we could actually turn the entire facade into a gigantic ,COMMA naturally ventilated ,COMMA rasterized image .PERIOD <BREAK>
It has no water .PERIOD It has no energy ,COMMA no resources .PERIOD <BREAK>
They accumulate the solar energy .PERIOD <BREAK>
Yes ,COMMA maybe just to round off .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'm just going to list some of them .PERIOD <BREAK>
Where should we start on solving these problems ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
To climate change that would be like Kyoto .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'd love to go into ,COMMA and get you to think about this process ,COMMA and that's actually what we did .PERIOD <BREAK>
Of course ,COMMA you have to ask yourself ,COMMA why on Earth was such a list never done before ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Nobody wants to do this .PERIOD <BREAK>
We'd like to know these things .PERIOD <BREAK>
Three of the world's top experts saying ,COMMA what can we do ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
What would be the price ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And of course ,COMMA I'm very happy you asked that question -- -- because that's a very good question .PERIOD <BREAK>
This offends a lot of people ,COMMA and that's probably one of the things where people will say I shouldn't come back ,COMMA either .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I'd like to talk about that ,COMMA because that's really curious .PERIOD <BREAK>
The reason why they came up with saying that Kyoto -- or doing something more than Kyoto -- is a bad deal is simply because it's very inefficient .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's not to say that if we had all the money in the world ,COMMA we wouldn't want to do it .PERIOD <BREAK>
There are many problems out there in the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
And what I want to make sure of is ,COMMA if we actually focus on problems ,COMMA that we focus on the right ones .PERIOD <BREAK>
The ones where we can do a lot of good rather than a little good .PERIOD <BREAK>
And of course ,COMMA we'll be even richer than that .PERIOD <BREAK>
We have ,COMMA you know ,COMMA The Day After Tomorrow -- it looks great ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
It's not about making things that have the most media attention ,COMMA but it's about making places where we can actually do the most good .PERIOD <BREAK>
But the point ,COMMA of course ,COMMA is still to say ,COMMA if you get another 100 billion dollars ,COMMA we still want to spend that in the best possible way ,COMMA don't we ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
So we actually invited 80 young people from all over the world to come and solve the same problem .PERIOD <BREAK>
My studio in Bali was only 10 minutes away from a monkey forest ,COMMA and monkeys ,COMMA of course ,COMMA are supposed to be the happiest of all animals .PERIOD <BREAK>
The serif is not really in place .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the rider thinks that he can tell the elephant what to do ,COMMA but the elephant really has his own ideas .PERIOD <BREAK>
And from that point of view we turned it into a lovely project .PERIOD <BREAK>
We stir this in until it's completely dissolved and then pour it into a growth bath .PERIOD <BREAK>
And then we're ready to add the living organism .PERIOD <BREAK>
And actually ,COMMA in hot weather ,COMMA I can just grow it outside .PERIOD <BREAK>
But I do think it could be quite a smart and sustainable addition to our increasingly precious natural resources .PERIOD <BREAK>
Thank you very much .PERIOD <BREAK>
Suzanne Lee .PERIOD <BREAK>
I made contact with a child from Swat who studied in a madrassa like this .PERIOD <BREAK>
How do the Taliban in your area get people to join them ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Then they take us to a madrassa and teach us things from the Koran .PERIOD <BREAK>
They ask us to use them only against the infidels .PERIOD <BREAK>
SOC :COLON I ,COMMA in my research ,COMMA have seen that the Taliban have perfected the way in which they recruit and train children ,COMMA and I think it's a five-step process .PERIOD <BREAK>
These children are explicitly forbidden from reading newspapers ,COMMA listening to radio ,COMMA reading any books that the teachers do not prescribe them .PERIOD <BREAK>
Effectively ,COMMA the Taliban create a complete blackout of any other source of information for these children .PERIOD <BREAK>
He blew himself up ,COMMA killing six .PERIOD <BREAK>
Two years ago here at TED I reported that we had discovered at Saturn ,COMMA with the Cassini Spacecraft ,COMMA an anomalously warm and geologically active region at the southern tip of the small Saturnine moon Enceladus ,COMMA seen here .PERIOD <BREAK>
While they're not amino acids ,COMMA we're now finding things like propane and benzene ,COMMA hydrogen cyanide ,COMMA and formaldehyde .PERIOD <BREAK>
So we are very encouraged by these results .PERIOD <BREAK>
And this is quite an extraordinary idea ,COMMA but it is reality today .PERIOD <BREAK>
This was created by an architectural firm called Shiro .PERIOD <BREAK>
And you can actually walk into it .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now 3 D printing can break away barriers in design which challenge the constraints of mass production .PERIOD <BREAK>
There's a lower chance of rejection .PERIOD <BREAK>
The piece of software will keep an individual within the bounds of the possible .PERIOD <BREAK>
I don't think that will happen soon .PERIOD <BREAK>
We're now ,COMMA instead of shipping a product across the world ,COMMA we're sending data across the Internet .PERIOD <BREAK>
And applying this to the idea of building up what's in our bodies .PERIOD <BREAK>
So one of the pioneers ,COMMA for example ,COMMA is Dr .PERIOD Anthony Atala ,COMMA and he has been working on layering cells to create body parts -- bladders ,COMMA valves ,COMMA kidneys .PERIOD <BREAK>
We like different things .PERIOD <BREAK>
I've been working on issues of poverty for more than 20 years ,COMMA and so it's ironic that the problem that and question that I most grapple with is how you actually define poverty .PERIOD What does it mean ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And I would see kids on the street corners ,COMMA and they'd say Obama ,COMMA he's our brother !EXCLAMATIONMARK <BREAK>
And she said ,COMMA You know ,COMMA the poverty wasn't so bad .PERIOD It was the humiliation and the embarrassment of it all .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I say ,COMMA 'Look at me .PERIOD You are not dead .PERIOD <BREAK>
And in the middle of this economic crisis ,COMMA where so many of us are inclined to pull in with fear ,COMMA I think we're well suited to take a cue from Jane and reach out ,COMMA recognizing that being poor doesn't mean being ordinary .PERIOD <BREAK>
It was a really big excitement for me to get into Caltech .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I concluded ,COMMA after researching every other technology that we could deploy for storing energy -- flywheels ,COMMA different formulations of batteries -- it just wasn't practical to store energy .PERIOD <BREAK>
There are a lot of new things that are happening to do that ,COMMA but fundamentally the process requires a tremendous amount of energy .PERIOD <BREAK>
So I tried to figure out what other way could we try and make cost-effective solar electricity .PERIOD <BREAK>
Traditionally ,COMMA concentrators look like this .PERIOD <BREAK>
Your efficiency goes down with more bounces ,COMMA because you lose about 10 percent with each bounce ,COMMA but this allowed us to collect light from a plus or minus 25 degree angle .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA once you have mobility ,COMMA now you're making a lot of engines because you've got lots of units ,COMMA as opposed to steam ships or big factories where you're not making as many units ,COMMA so this was the engine that ended up benefiting from mass production where all the other engines didn't benefit .PERIOD <BREAK>
So we tried to look at the Stirling engine in a new way ,COMMA because it was practical -- weight no longer mattered for our application The internal combustion engine took off because weight mattered because you were moving around .PERIOD <BREAK>
So someone came up with a very clever idea ,COMMA to -- instead of heating the whole cylinder and cooling the whole cylinder ,COMMA what about if you put a displacer inside -- a little thing that shuttles the air back and forth .PERIOD <BREAK>
We measured each one ,COMMA we readjusted the model to what we measured ,COMMA and then we led that to the current prototype .PERIOD <BREAK>
It led to a very compact ,COMMA inexpensive engine ,COMMA and this is what the engine looks like .PERIOD <BREAK>
So an example of that is ,COMMA here's the map of the United States .PERIOD <BREAK>
And of course ,COMMA look at Africa .PERIOD <BREAK>
There's 10000 watts of light pouring on the stage ,COMMA one horsepower is 756 watts ,COMMA at full power .PERIOD <BREAK>
But ,COMMA everywhere around us we have insatiable use for energy because it's so cheap .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it's cheap because we've been subsidized by energy that's been concentrated by the sun .PERIOD <BREAK>
Headlines that look like this when they have to do with climate change ,COMMA and headlines that look like this when they have to do with air quality or smog .PERIOD <BREAK>
And this is the tower from below .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA as you can imagine ,COMMA the inside of this aircraft doesn't look like any plane you would take on vacation .PERIOD <BREAK>
We do all of this to understand the chemistry of one molecule .PERIOD <BREAK>
What I am always thinking about is what this session is about ,COMMA which is called simplicity .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA I was fortunate enough to be born a very dreamy child .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that was a good thing to help ,COMMA you know ,COMMA the cause .PERIOD <BREAK>
But ,COMMA then he came back ,COMMA and things happened ,COMMA and I decided I really hated my writing ,COMMA that it was awful ,COMMA awful ,COMMA purple prose .PERIOD <BREAK>
Well ,COMMA Tibor really started the studio ,COMMA called M&ampCo .PERIOD <BREAK>
That to be able to talk about content ,COMMA to break apart what you normally expect ,COMMA to use humor and surprise ,COMMA elegance and humanity in your work was really important to us .PERIOD <BREAK>
I don't really -- I mean ,COMMA I could tell you that I didn't understand ,COMMA I'm not proud of it ,COMMA but I didn't understand let's say 95 percent of the talks at this conference .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA I'm open to the possibilities of not knowing and finding out something new .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so ,COMMA I was able to put that into this story ,COMMA which is an alphabet ,COMMA and hopefully go on to something else .PERIOD <BREAK>
I work for the New Yorker ,COMMA and I do covers ,COMMA and 9 / 11 happened and it was ,COMMA you know ,COMMA a complete and utter end of the world as we knew it .PERIOD <BREAK>
We hoped we'd be funny ,COMMA but we didn't know it would be a cover ,COMMA and we didn't know that that image ,COMMA at the moment that it happened ,COMMA would be something that would be so wonderful for a lot of people .PERIOD <BREAK>
And David Remnick ,COMMA who was really wonderful about it ,COMMA had one problem .PERIOD He didn't like Al Zheimers ,COMMA because he thought it would insult people with Alzheimer's .PERIOD <BREAK>
And ,COMMA He noticed a large stain in the center of the rug .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA what I did when I was painting was I started singing ,COMMA because I really adore singing ,COMMA and I think that music is the highest form of all art .PERIOD <BREAK>
I happen to know it for a fact .PERIOD <BREAK>
Maybe amongst themselves they had a few good laughs ,COMMA but Stalin was a paranoid man ,COMMA even more than my father .PERIOD <BREAK>
Which I think I made up ,COMMA which is a good thing .PERIOD <BREAK>
I received a box in the mail and it was wrapped with newspaper and there was the picture of the man on the newspaper and he was dead .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I really spend a lot of time wondering ,COMMA how much truth do we tell ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
How do we know when we are ourselves ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
A quote by Bertrand Russell ,COMMA All the labor of all the ages ,COMMA all the devotion ,COMMA all the inspiration ,COMMA all the noonday brightness of human genius are destined to extinction .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I would like to run it for them .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it says ,COMMA Ich habe genug ,COMMA which is a Bach cantata ,COMMA which I once thought meant I've had it ,COMMA I can't take it anymore ,COMMA give me a break ,COMMA but I was wrong .PERIOD <BREAK>
I thought that things would be pretty fun and there would be more things to play with .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA since we've been here this week ,COMMA we've taken millions of breaths ,COMMA collectively ,COMMA and perhaps we haven't witnessed any course changes happening in our lives ,COMMA but we often miss the very subtle changes .PERIOD <BREAK>
So we threw in -- we created a primordial soup with lots of pieces of robots -- with bars ,COMMA with motors ,COMMA with neurons .PERIOD <BREAK>
We're concerned in the national security community ,COMMA and of course in the biology community and the public health community .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's also carried on migration patterns of wild migratory aquatic birds .PERIOD <BREAK>
So what have people been doing with this money ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Let's everybody run around and play your role .PERIOD <BREAK>
Most local facilities would all be competing to try and get their hands on their piece of the federal stockpile of a drug called Tamiflu ,COMMA which may or may not be helpful -- I'll get into that -- of available vaccines ,COMMA and any other treatments ,COMMA and masks ,COMMA and anything that's been stockpiled .PERIOD <BREAK>
And you'll have massive competition .PERIOD <BREAK>
During the SARS epidemic in Beijing quarantine did seem to help .PERIOD <BREAK>
And their hand got contaminated with the outside of the mask ,COMMA and then they rubbed their nose .PERIOD Bingo !EXCLAMATIONMARK They got SARS .PERIOD <BREAK>
The pandemic circulated three times in 18 months in the absence of commercial air travel .PERIOD <BREAK>
This was based on European and North American data .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that a more likely toll is somewhere in the neighborhood of 80 to 100 million people before we had commercial air travel .PERIOD <BREAK>
So are we ready ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
If you expand that out to think of a whole community ,COMMA or all your employees in your company ,COMMA you begin to realize how limited the Tamiflu option might be .PERIOD <BREAK>
But really ?QUESTIONMARK Do you really have a place to stockpile 18 months worth of food ?QUESTIONMARK Twenty-four months worth of food ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Do you want to view the pandemic threat the way back in the 1950 s people viewed the civil defense issue ,COMMA and build your own little bomb shelter for pandemic flu ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And I hope I've convinced you of that ,COMMA which means that the real job is go out and say to your local leaders ,COMMA and your national leaders ,COMMA Why haven't you solved these problems ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
But can you sustain your company that way ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
The moment that you see any evidence of serious human-to-human to transmission .PERIOD <BREAK>
The mechanism isn't clear .PERIOD <BREAK>
Again we don't really know for sure .PERIOD <BREAK>
Audience member :COLON One of the things I've heard is that the real death cause when you get a flu is the associated pneumonia ,COMMA and that a pneumonia vaccine may offer you 50 percent better chance of survival .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so far in the H 5 N 1 cases in people ,COMMA similarly bacterial infection has not been an issue at all .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it won't do any good to bring in the tanks and the artillery because those T-cells don't recognize it either .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now my story has a lot to do with dreaming ,COMMA although I'm known to make my dreams come true .PERIOD <BREAK>
One ,COMMA two ,COMMA three ,COMMA four ,COMMA five ,COMMA six and seven .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I go to see a famous magician and proudly ask him ,COMMA Well what do you think ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
For the move to be professional ,COMMA it has to be less than one second and it has to be perfect .PERIOD <BREAK>
But in America you have to explain .PERIOD What are clubs ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
They have to be precisely lathed .PERIOD <BREAK>
Anyway ,COMMA here I was progressing with my new clubs .PERIOD <BREAK>
The clubs were escaping me at each throw .PERIOD <BREAK>
So I proudly showed him my clubs .PERIOD <BREAK>
He said ,COMMA Philippe ,COMMA you have been had .PERIOD <BREAK>
They are impossible to juggle .PERIOD <BREAK>
I get a pair of pliers and some coat hangers ,COMMA and I gather them together in some kind of ropey path .PERIOD <BREAK>
Well within a few days I'm able to do one crossing .PERIOD <BREAK>
If not ,COMMA I will never do that first step .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's a straight line ,COMMA which sags ,COMMA which sways ,COMMA which vibrates ,COMMA which rolls on itself ,COMMA which is ice ,COMMA which is three tons tight ,COMMA ready to explode ,COMMA ready to swallow me .PERIOD <BREAK>
An inner howl assails me ,COMMA the wild longing to flee .PERIOD <BREAK>
I was not interested in collecting the gigantic ,COMMA in breaking records .PERIOD <BREAK>
And something happened .PERIOD <BREAK>
He didn't know the true story .PERIOD <BREAK>
Trees are wonderful arenas for discovery because of their tall stature ,COMMA their complex structure ,COMMA the biodiversity they foster and their quiet beauty .PERIOD <BREAK>
The most mysterious part of forests is the upper tree canopy .PERIOD <BREAK>
These are not epiphyte roots :COLON these are roots that emerge from the trunk and branch of the host trees themselves .PERIOD <BREAK>
We know it's a lot ,COMMA but we do not yet know the answers to how much ,COMMA and by what processes ,COMMA carbon is being taken out of the atmosphere ,COMMA held in its biomass ,COMMA and moving on through the ecosystem .PERIOD <BREAK>
They ended up making a CD which they took home to their family and friends ,COMMA thereby expressing their own experiences with nature in their own medium .PERIOD <BREAK>
They were incredibly enthusiastic about the work .PERIOD <BREAK>
And they embraced the idea that they could help develop a research design in order to grow these mosses .PERIOD <BREAK>
We gave talks once a month ,COMMA and that actually ended up implementing some amazing sustainability projects at the prisons -- organic gardens ,COMMA worm culture ,COMMA recycling ,COMMA water catchment and beekeeping .PERIOD <BREAK>
As many of you are aware ,COMMA the world of academia is a rather inward-looking one .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'm trying to help researchers move more outward to have their own partnerships with people outside of the academic community .PERIOD <BREAK>
When I look into my heart ,COMMA I see trees -- this is actually an image of a real heart -- there are trees in our hearts ,COMMA there are trees in your hearts .PERIOD <BREAK>
It was taken 18 years ago .PERIOD <BREAK>
There is a problem with scuba though ,COMMA in that it imposes some limitations on how deep you can go ,COMMA and it turns out that depth is about 200 feet .PERIOD <BREAK>
And there's a phenomenon called Henry's Law that says that gases will dissolve into a fluid in proportion to the partial pressures which you're exposing them to .PERIOD <BREAK>
You die also because oxygen toxicity can cause a seizure -- makes you convulse underwater ,COMMA not a good thing to happen underwater .PERIOD <BREAK>
This picture was taken 300 feet deep ,COMMA catching new species of fish .PERIOD <BREAK>
And ,COMMA indeed ,COMMA there is a better way .PERIOD <BREAK>
Alright ,COMMA closed-circuit rebreather -- what is it about it that makes it different from scuba ,COMMA and why is it better ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Well ,COMMA there are three main advantages to a rebreather .PERIOD <BREAK>
So we need another gas ,COMMA something to dilute the oxygen with .PERIOD <BREAK>
But ,COMMA if we want to go deeper ,COMMA of course ,COMMA we need another gas supply .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA normally you don't have to do that because all of it's done automatically for you with the electronics ,COMMA the third system of a rebreather .PERIOD <BREAK>
And yes ,COMMA it's a little nerve-wracking .PERIOD <BREAK>
So sharks aren't quite as dangerous as most people make them out to be .PERIOD <BREAK>
There's a cover story all about the great explorers of our time .PERIOD <BREAK>
The last article is an article entitled No New Frontiers .PERIOD <BREAK>
Even if you ignore the scientific value of this thing ,COMMA just look at the monetary value of this thing .PERIOD <BREAK>
And then ,COMMA eventually ,COMMA I got around to looking in my bucket .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA this one's pretty cool .PERIOD <BREAK>
So a very large percentage of what is out there isn't really known .PERIOD <BREAK>
We thought we had a handle on all the reef fish diversity -- evidently not .PERIOD <BREAK>
At the beginning I told you that I was going to show you two extraordinary photographs .PERIOD <BREAK>
The reason I show this -- not to put a downer on everything -- but I just want to use it to key off my philosophy of life in general ,COMMA which is that we all have two goals .PERIOD <BREAK>
The first goal we share with every other living thing on this planet ,COMMA which is to survive .PERIOD I call it perpetuation :COLON the survival of the species and survival of ourselves ,COMMA because they're both about perpetuating the genome .PERIOD <BREAK>
You have to balance those two goals .PERIOD <BREAK>
But here's what really perplexed me .PERIOD <BREAK>
But diagnosing a brain disorder without actually looking at the brain is analogous to treating a patient with a heart problem based on their physical symptoms ,COMMA without even doing an ECG or a chest X-ray to look at the heart .PERIOD <BREAK>
Yet ,COMMA despite all the advances in medical technology ,COMMA the diagnosis of brain disorders in one in six children still remained so limited .PERIOD <BREAK>
And then I came across a team at Harvard University that had taken one such advanced medical technology and finally applied it ,COMMA instead of in brain research ,COMMA towards diagnosing brain disorders in children .PERIOD <BREAK>
And another program called Statistical Probability Mapping then performs mathematical calculations to determine whether any of these abnormalities are clinically significant ,COMMA allowing us to provide a much more accurate neurological diagnosis of the child's symptoms .PERIOD <BREAK>
When we used this groundbreaking EEG technology to actually look at Justin's brain ,COMMA the results were startling .PERIOD <BREAK>
But we are now in a new era of neuroscience ,COMMA one in which we can finally look directly at brain function in real time with no risks and no side effects ,COMMA non-invasively ,COMMA and find the true source of so many disabilities in children .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's something like life ,COMMA that once you get in it you can't get out .PERIOD <BREAK>
There are two clips I want to show you ,COMMA the first one is a kind of hodgepodge ,COMMA its just three little moments ,COMMA four little moments with three of the people who are here tonight .PERIOD <BREAK>
It was built entirely by hand off bamboo scaffolding ,COMMA people carrying these baskets of concrete on their heads ,COMMA dumping them in the forms .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA those are the two clips I'm going to show .PERIOD <BREAK>
I mean as tragic as his death was in a railway station ,COMMA it was so consistent with his life ,COMMA you know ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Man :COLON Yes ,COMMA it is the national image of Bangladesh .PERIOD <BREAK>
No ,COMMA he never saw this .PERIOD <BREAK>
And this is the largest project he has got in here ,COMMA the poorest country in the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's a story of nations ,COMMA of ideologies ,COMMA of territories ,COMMA and of conflicts among them .PERIOD <BREAK>
Here .PERIOD <BREAK>
Are we alone in this vast universe of energy and matter and chemistry and physics ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Whether we're born in San Francisco ,COMMA or Sudan ,COMMA or close to the heart of the Milky Way galaxy ,COMMA we are the products of a billion-year lineage of wandering stardust .PERIOD <BREAK>
Well ,COMMA what about 10 ^ 22 ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
That line would have to be 38 million miles above this stage .PERIOD <BREAK>
I think this is what David Deutsch meant in 2005 ,COMMA when he ended his Oxford TEDTalk by saying he had two principles he'd like to share for living ,COMMA and he would like to carve them on stone tablets .PERIOD <BREAK>
We've been searching ever since ,COMMA but it's impossible to overstate the magnitude of the search that remains .PERIOD <BREAK>
And over those long distances ,COMMA its signal is very faint when it reaches us .PERIOD <BREAK>
But this is a simple signal ,COMMA and tomorrow we want to be able to find more complex signals .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is a very good year .PERIOD <BREAK>
2009 is the 400 th anniversary of Galileo's first use of the telescope ,COMMA Darwin's 200 th birthday ,COMMA the 150 th anniversary of the publication of On the Origin of Species ,COMMA the 50 th anniversary of SETI as a science ,COMMA the 25 th anniversary of the incorporation of the SETI Institute as a non-profit ,COMMA and of course ,COMMA the 25 th anniversary of TED .PERIOD <BREAK>
The first step would be to tap into the global brain trust ,COMMA to build an environment where raw data could be stored ,COMMA and where it could be accessed and manipulated ,COMMA where new algorithms could be developed and old algorithms made more efficient .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'm sorry Seth Godin ,COMMA but over the millennia ,COMMA we've seen where tribalism leads .PERIOD <BREAK>
It records the annual rise and fall of greenhouse gases and temperatures going back before the onset of the last ice ages .PERIOD <BREAK>
Ten times a day ,COMMA they extract the 10 -foot long cylinder of compressed ice crystals that contain the unsullied air and trace chemicals laid down by snow ,COMMA season after season for thousands of years .PERIOD <BREAK>
From this ,COMMA we can detect an extraordinary number of things .PERIOD <BREAK>
Imagine juggling a snowball across the tropics .PERIOD <BREAK>
They have to ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA make sure this ice never gets warmer than about 20 degrees below zero ,COMMA otherwise ,COMMA the key gases inside it will dissipate .PERIOD <BREAK>
Early explorers sailed off the edge of the map ,COMMA and they found a place where the normal rules of time and temperature seem suspended .PERIOD <BREAK>
It is a voice of experience .PERIOD <BREAK>
It is a voice we should heed .PERIOD <BREAK>
This thesis is set out in a book called Winning the Oil Endgame that four colleagues and I wrote and have posted for free at Oilendgamecom -- about 170000 downloads so far .PERIOD <BREAK>
So when we did ,COMMA we found some very surprising things .PERIOD <BREAK>
And serious competition from Europe ,COMMA from Korea ,COMMA and next is China ,COMMA which will soon be a major net exporter of cars .PERIOD <BREAK>
The point here is ,COMMA these cars are going to be made super efficient .PERIOD <BREAK>
The question is ,COMMA who will make them ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
It's financeable in the private capital market .PERIOD <BREAK>
And in the upper left ,COMMA a pioneering effort 14 years ago by GM -- 84 miles a gallon without even using a hybrid ,COMMA in a four-seater .PERIOD <BREAK>
In the airplane business ,COMMA it's again a similar story where the first 20 percent fuel saving is free ,COMMA as Boeing is now demonstrating in its new Dreamliner .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it turns out that these are quite remarkable for safety .PERIOD <BREAK>
The Golf was totaled .PERIOD <BREAK>
Because these materials could actually absorb six to 12 times as much energy per pound as steel ,COMMA and do so a lot more smoothly .PERIOD <BREAK>
This expands choice rapidly in the market ,COMMA and actually makes more money for automakers as well .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'd like to deal with the lack of affordable personal mobility in this country by making it very cheaply possible for low-income families to get efficient ,COMMA reliable ,COMMA warranted new cars that they could otherwise never get .PERIOD <BREAK>
This creates a new million-car-a-year market for Detroit from customers they weren't going to get otherwise ,COMMA because they weren't creditworthy and could never afford a new car .PERIOD <BREAK>
It turns out that if ,COMMA say ,COMMA African-American and white households had the same car ownership ,COMMA it would cut employment disparity about in half by providing better access to job opportunities .PERIOD <BREAK>
Just turn it over to the private sector ,COMMA and we have an Internet .PERIOD <BREAK>
Ours is on the demand side .PERIOD <BREAK>
I was just coming out of a failed virtual reality business and supporting myself by being on the speaking circuit and writing books -- after twenty years or so in the computer game industry having ideas that people didn't think they could sell .PERIOD <BREAK>
And at the end of those remarkable conversations with kids and their best friends across the United States ,COMMA after two years ,COMMA we pulled together some survey data from another 10000 children ,COMMA drew up a set up of what we thought were the key findings of our research ,COMMA and spent another year transforming them into design heuristics ,COMMA for designing computer-based products -- and ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA any kind of products -- for little girls ,COMMA ages eight to 12 .PERIOD <BREAK>
And these voices will be accompanied by photographs that they took for us of their lives ,COMMA of the things that they value and care about .PERIOD <BREAK>
Girl 3 :COLON This is my pretend [unclear] one .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is the second day in Rockett's life .PERIOD <BREAK>
I wanted to show you the ways ,COMMA innocuous as they seem ,COMMA in which we're incorporating what we've learned about girls -- their desires to experience greater emotional flexibility ,COMMA and to play around with the social complexity of their lives .PERIOD <BREAK>
He went through Europe ,COMMA through World War II ,COMMA stealing ,COMMA extorting and occasionally buying various paintings for his collection .PERIOD <BREAK>
So he finally found an art dealer ,COMMA a Dutch art dealer named Han van Meegeren ,COMMA who sold him a wonderful Vermeer for the cost of what would now be 10 million dollars .PERIOD <BREAK>
He had a lesser charge of forgery ,COMMA got a year sentence and died a hero to the Dutch people .PERIOD <BREAK>
Many sociologists like Veblen and Wolfe would argue that the reason why we take origins so seriously is because we're snobs ,COMMA because we're focused on status .PERIOD <BREAK>
Would you eat this ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Few of you would eat it if it's a rat or a human .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's simple ,COMMA you tell them they're from McDonald's .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's very simple :COLON pour it from an expensive bottle .PERIOD <BREAK>
It will make a difference if they turn out to be much younger or much older than you think they are .PERIOD <BREAK>
That drops the value of it ,COMMA suggesting that that's one reason why we like it .PERIOD <BREAK>
Rather ,COMMA it's because I want something that has a specific history .PERIOD <BREAK>
Who here likes the work of Jackson Pollock ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And the Washington Post reporter Gene Weingarten decided to enlist him for an audacious experiment .PERIOD <BREAK>
So he got Joshua Bell to take his million dollar violin down to a Washington DC .PERIOD subway station and stand in the corner and see how much money he would make .PERIOD <BREAK>
He actually made 20 dollars more than that ,COMMA but he didn't count it .PERIOD <BREAK>
So she's stunned that he's standing in a subway station .PERIOD <BREAK>
One lovely experiment was done by Kurt Gray and Dan Wegner .PERIOD <BREAK>
And what I hope to show is that unpicking dodgy claims ,COMMA unpicking the evidence behind dodgy claims ,COMMA isn't a kind of nasty carping activity ;SEMICOLON it's socially useful ,COMMA but it's also an extremely valuable explanatory tool .PERIOD <BREAK>
She ,COMMA it turns out ,COMMA has a non-accredited correspondence course PhD .PERIOD <BREAK>
A glass of red wine a day could help prevent breast cancer .PERIOD <BREAK>
So I'm going to tell you about one trial ,COMMA which is probably the most well-reported trial in the UK .PERIOD news media over the past decade .PERIOD <BREAK>
And this has been demonstrated in a whole raft of fascinating studies comparing one kind of placebo against another .PERIOD <BREAK>
We know from three different studies on three different types of pain that a saltwater injection is a more effective treatment for pain than taking a sugar pill ,COMMA taking a dummy pill that has no medicine in it -- not because the injection or the pills do anything physically to the body ,COMMA but because an injection feels like a much more dramatic intervention .PERIOD <BREAK>
But that's not enough .PERIOD <BREAK>
What I find really fascinating is that the pharmaceutical industry uses exactly the same kinds of tricks and devices ,COMMA but slightly more sophisticated versions of them ,COMMA in order to distort the evidence that they give to doctors and patients ,COMMA and which we use to make vitally important decisions .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it's a foregone conclusion ,COMMA if you give a drug at that high a dose ,COMMA that it will have more side effects and that your new drug will look better .PERIOD <BREAK>
Everybody wanted to show that their drug was better than risperidone ,COMMA so you see a bunch of trials comparing new antipsychotic drugs against risperidone at eight milligrams a day .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is a drug called reboxetine .PERIOD <BREAK>
Around half of all of the trial data on antidepressants has been withheld ,COMMA but it goes way beyond that .PERIOD <BREAK>
But the companies withheld that data from them ,COMMA and so did the European Medicines Agency for three years .PERIOD <BREAK>
The infectious diseases Cochrane Group ,COMMA which are based in Italy ,COMMA has been trying to get the full data in a usable form out of the drug companies so that they can make a full decision about whether this drug is effective or not ,COMMA and they've not been able to get that information .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is undoubtedly the single biggest ethical problem facing medicine today .PERIOD <BREAK>
Thank you very much .PERIOD <BREAK>
I saw people struggling to get by ,COMMA not knowing what was what and what was next .PERIOD <BREAK>
You want a better life for yourself .PERIOD <BREAK>
There's this thing ,COMMA this militarization of the world ,COMMA and it's centered right in the United States .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the United States is responsible for almost one half of the world's military spending -- four percent of the world's population .PERIOD <BREAK>
And you feel it ;SEMICOLON you see it every day .PERIOD <BREAK>
You say ,COMMA How is that possible ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And their leaders ,COMMA their leaders :COLON before they send their sons and daughters off to war in your country -- and you know the reason -- before they send them off ,COMMA they go to a Christian church ,COMMA and they pray to their Christian God ,COMMA and they ask for protection and guidance from that god .PERIOD <BREAK>
Why ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
They do wonderful things ,COMMA but they also do the bad things ,COMMA and you can't tell the difference .PERIOD <BREAK>
And this guy ,COMMA you get a guy like Lt .PERIOD Gen .PERIOD William Boykin .PERIOD <BREAK>
And you're thinking ,COMMA God ,COMMA if this guy is saying that ,COMMA then all the soldiers must be saying that .PERIOD <BREAK>
And this word here ,COMMA George Bush called this war a crusade .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's a holy war against Muslims .PERIOD <BREAK>
You feel frightened .PERIOD Of course you feel frightened .PERIOD <BREAK>
He wants to burn Korans ,COMMA our holy book .PERIOD <BREAK>
You don't know that .PERIOD <BREAK>
So here .PERIOD <BREAK>
And this is a perspective .PERIOD <BREAK>
So here's what I want you to do .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'm going out to defend your freedom ,COMMA your lives .PERIOD <BREAK>
And if I can get you to step into their shoes and walk an inch ,COMMA one tiny inch ,COMMA then imagine the kind of sociological analysis that you can do in all other aspects of your life .PERIOD <BREAK>
Thank you .PERIOD <BREAK>
It was only in the second half of the 20 th century that we slowly began to pull ourselves out of this abyss .PERIOD <BREAK>
You know in 1950 the typical ship carried 5000 to 10000 tons worth of goods .PERIOD <BREAK>
Today a container ship can carry 150000 tons ;SEMICOLON it can be manned with a smaller crew ;SEMICOLON and unloaded faster than ever before .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I think ,COMMA as you'll see ,COMMA there's reasons for optimism ,COMMA because I believe that the best is yet to come .PERIOD <BREAK>
Well how else can we create new ideas ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
How else can we create new ideas ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>

How many Ramanujans are there in India today toiling in the fields ,COMMA barely able to feed themselves ,COMMA when they could be feeding the world ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Twenty-first century could easily be 33 ,COMMA even higher percent .PERIOD <BREAK>
Even at that rate ,COMMA by 2100 average GDP per capita in the world will be $ 200000 .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's not that far .PERIOD <BREAK>
But some of our grandchildren probably will .PERIOD <BREAK>
What about a great depression ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Now let's imagine that you were an economist in 1929 ,COMMA trying to forecast future growth for the United States ,COMMA not knowing that the economy was about to go off a cliff ,COMMA not knowing that we were about to enter the greatest economic disaster certainly in the 20 th century .PERIOD <BREAK>
In the last 30 years ,COMMA thanks to explorations in remote parts of the world and advances in technology ,COMMA biologists have ,COMMA for example ,COMMA added a full one-third of the known frog and other amphibian species ,COMMA to bring the current total to 5400 ,COMMA and more continue to pour in .PERIOD <BREAK>
Two new kinds of whales have been discovered ,COMMA along with two new antelopes ,COMMA dozens of monkey species and a new kind of elephant -- and even a distinct kind of gorilla .PERIOD <BREAK>
Consider the nematode roundworm ,COMMA the most abundant of all animals .PERIOD <BREAK>
But that number of bacteria species can be found in one gram of soil ,COMMA just a little handful of soil ,COMMA in the 10 billion bacteria that would be there .PERIOD <BREAK>
My own epiphany as a conservationist came in 1953 ,COMMA while a Harvard graduate student ,COMMA searching for rare ants found in the mountain forests of Cuba ,COMMA ants that shine in the sunlight -- metallic green or metallic blue ,COMMA according to species ,COMMA and one species ,COMMA I discovered ,COMMA metallic gold .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the final letter is O ,COMMA for over-harvesting -- driving species into extinction by excessive hunting and fishing .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's in the United States .PERIOD <BREAK>
But what excites me is that since I first put forward this particular idea in that form ,COMMA science has advanced .PERIOD <BREAK>
I wish you would help them .PERIOD <BREAK>
The encyclopedia will quickly pay for itself in practical applications .PERIOD <BREAK>
The idea that in that room at that moment ,COMMA everyone ,COMMA regardless of their age ,COMMA their gender ,COMMA their race ,COMMA their color ,COMMA their religion ,COMMA comes together .PERIOD <BREAK>
Let's start with technology .PERIOD <BREAK>
All right .PERIOD Let's start with theater .PERIOD <BREAK>
But the teachers came to me afterward and told me they hadn't seen the kids that attentive .PERIOD <BREAK>
Zero does not speak ,COMMA is neither man nor woman .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that usually ,COMMA if you're a bit extraordinary ,COMMA if you're not exactly of human appearance ,COMMA then people will feel inclined to participate and to feel out loud .PERIOD <BREAK>
I've worked as a doctor clown in a hospital for two years .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's a human and technological revolution .PERIOD <BREAK>
And well ,COMMA of course ,COMMA the Dutch can't eat all these pigs .PERIOD <BREAK>
And what I was curious about -- because historically ,COMMA the whole pig would be used up until the last bit so nothing would be wasted -- and I was curious to find out if this was actually still the case .PERIOD <BREAK>
And in cheesecake and all kinds of desserts ,COMMA like chocolate mousse ,COMMA tiramisu ,COMMA vanilla pudding ,COMMA everything that's cooled in the supermarket ,COMMA there's gelatin to make it look good .PERIOD <BREAK>
Fine bone china -- this is a real classic .PERIOD <BREAK>
I was not planning on showing you any meat because ,COMMA of course ,COMMA half the book's meat and you probably all know what meats they are .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the reason for this is that pigs are actually quite close to human beings ,COMMA so the collagen is as well .PERIOD <BREAK>
And they said ,COMMA Well the director of the company decided not to let you borrow this heart valve ,COMMA because want his product to be associated with pigs .PERIOD <BREAK>
Well it is ,COMMA because everything that can't be used for anything else is made into a fuel that can be used as renewable energy source .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is a picture of Maurice Druon ,COMMA the Honorary Perpetual Secretary of L'Academie francaise ,COMMA the French Academy .PERIOD <BREAK>
We see it in the constant appearance of slang and jargon ,COMMA of the historical change in languages ,COMMA in divergence of dialects and the formation of new languages .PERIOD <BREAK>
The problem is ,COMMA which verbs go in which constructions ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
A transitive verb mandates that there has to be an object there :COLON Sam devoured the pizza .PERIOD You can't just say ,COMMA Sam devoured .PERIOD <BREAK>
There are dozens or scores of verbs of this type ,COMMA each of which shapes its sentence .PERIOD <BREAK>
First ,COMMA there's a level of fine-grained conceptual structure ,COMMA which we automatically and unconsciously compute every time we produce or utter a sentence ,COMMA that governs our use of language .PERIOD <BREAK>
Or ,COMMA The meeting went from three to four ,COMMA in which we conceive of time as stretched along a line .PERIOD <BREAK>
Or ,COMMA Rose forced herself to go ,COMMA as if there were two entities inside Rose's head ,COMMA engaged in a tug of a war .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I'll start out with a puzzle ,COMMA the puzzle of indirect speech acts .PERIOD <BREAK>
For example ,COMMA in brotherhoods ,COMMA fraternal organizations ,COMMA sororities ,COMMA locutions like the family of man ,COMMA you try to get people who are not related to use the relationship type that would ordinarily be appropriate to close kin .PERIOD <BREAK>
In that case ,COMMA the consequences are rather severe .PERIOD <BREAK>
On the other hand ,COMMA if you extend the bribe ,COMMA if the officer is dishonest ,COMMA you get a huge payoff of going free .PERIOD <BREAK>
The honest officer can't hold you to it as being a bribe ,COMMA and therefore ,COMMA you get the nuisance of the traffic ticket .PERIOD <BREAK>
Because I get to talk about one of my favorite critters ,COMMA which is the Western Grebe .PERIOD You haven't lived until you've seen these guys do their courtship dance .PERIOD <BREAK>
What they said to us at first was ,COMMA you know ,COMMA we already do biomimicry .PERIOD <BREAK>
And they said ,COMMA you know what happens is ,COMMA mineral -- just like at your house -- mineral builds up .PERIOD <BREAK>
So if we had some way to stop this scaling -- and so I picked up some shells on the beach .PERIOD And I asked them ,COMMA what is scaling ?QUESTIONMARK What's inside your pipes ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And they didn't know that .PERIOD <BREAK>
You know ,COMMA it's a silo ,COMMA people in silos .PERIOD They didn't know that the same thing was happening .PERIOD So one of them thought about it and said ,COMMA OK ,COMMA well ,COMMA if this is just crystallization that happens automatically out of seawater -- self-assembly -- then why aren't shells infinite in size ?QUESTIONMARK What stops the scaling ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
How do we redesign the world that we make ,COMMA the human-made world ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And there's a lot of cool technologies out there that life has .PERIOD <BREAK>
What's the syllabus ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And thirdly ,COMMA how does life make things disappear into systems ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And at the same time ,COMMA I'm listening to a lot of businesses and finding what their sort of grand challenges are .PERIOD <BREAK>
On the lower left there is a picture of mother of pearl forming out of seawater .PERIOD It's a layered structure that's mineral and then polymer ,COMMA and it makes it very ,COMMA very tough .PERIOD <BREAK>
Here are two organisms that pull water .PERIOD <BREAK>
Pulling water out of Monterey fog and out of the sweaty air in Atlanta ,COMMA before it gets into a building ,COMMA are key technologies .PERIOD <BREAK>
Green chemistry is replacing our industrial chemistry with nature's recipe book .PERIOD <BREAK>
That little guy over there is a tardigrade .PERIOD <BREAK>
There is a problem with vaccines around the world not getting to patients .PERIOD And the reason is that the refrigeration somehow gets broken ;SEMICOLON what's called the cold chain gets broken .PERIOD <BREAK>
They can be put in a glove compartment ,COMMA OK .PERIOD <BREAK>
Chris Anderson :COLON Talk about foreplay ,COMMA I -- we need to get to 12 ,COMMA but really quickly .PERIOD <BREAK>
OK ,COMMA so that's the healing one .PERIOD <BREAK>
And really ,COMMA that's what other organisms do as well .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's the twelfth one .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I saw from a young age that having a decent job and earning a good living made the biggest difference for families who were struggling .PERIOD <BREAK>
I mean here was a girl who had never lived in peace time who somehow had come to sound like a candidate from The Apprentice .PERIOD <BREAK>
My first business was a dressmaking business I started under the Taliban .PERIOD <BREAK>
The IMF official is hardly the only person to automatically file women under micro .PERIOD <BREAK>
And in many places ,COMMA they're there .PERIOD <BREAK>
Because -- and I say this as somebody who worked in finance -- 500 billion dollars at least has gone into the emerging markets in the past decade .PERIOD <BREAK>
Just think of the benefits when it comes to jobs ,COMMA productivity ,COMMA employment ,COMMA child nutrition ,COMMA maternal mortality ,COMMA literacy and much ,COMMA much more .PERIOD <BREAK>
And not one country in all the world has eliminated its economic participation gap -- not one .PERIOD <BREAK>
The women in my family are not exceptions .PERIOD <BREAK>
The women in this room and watching in LA .PERIOD <BREAK>
Together we can make certain that the so-called exceptions begin to rule .PERIOD <BREAK>
Once upon a time in 19 th century Germany ,COMMA there was the book .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now during this time ,COMMA the book was the king of storytelling .PERIOD <BREAK>
His name was Lothar ,COMMA Lothar Meggendorfer .PERIOD <BREAK>
This man refused to fold to the conventions of normalcy and just decided to fold .PERIOD <BREAK>
Whether storytellers realized it or not ,COMMA they were channeling Meggendorfer's spirit when they moved opera to vaudville ,COMMA radio news to radio theater ,COMMA film to film in motion to film in sound ,COMMA color ,COMMA 3 D ,COMMA on VHS and on DVD .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I really want to build green ,COMMA but I'm very suspicious of all of these well-meaning articles ,COMMA people long on moral authority and short on data ,COMMA telling me how to do these kinds of things .PERIOD <BREAK>
Wipe it up ,COMMA throw it away .PERIOD <BREAK>
unless I use a front-loading ,COMMA high-efficiency washing machine ,COMMA and then it looks a little bit better .PERIOD <BREAK>
So what this says is that sometimes the things that you least expect -- the position in which you put the handle -- have a bigger effect than any of those other things that you were trying to optimize .PERIOD <BREAK>
We wanted to know how much better we could do .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA PVC is a little bit better ,COMMA but still not as good as the wood that we chose .PERIOD <BREAK>
When it comes time to sheetrock ,COMMA if you use EcoRock it's about a quarter of the embodied energy of standard sheetrock .PERIOD <BREAK>
If you put carpeting in your house ,COMMA it's about a tenth of the embodied energy of the entire house ,COMMA unless you use concrete or wood for a much lower embodied energy .PERIOD <BREAK>
So now we add in the final construction energy ,COMMA we add it all up ,COMMA and we've built a house for less than half of the typical embodied energy for building a house like this .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA I probably would have upgraded the old house to be more energy-efficient ,COMMA and in that case ,COMMA it would take me more about 20 years to break even .PERIOD <BREAK>
So what does this mean ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
You might want to leave now .PERIOD <BREAK>
So I did .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I'm talking specifically about synanthropic species ,COMMA which are species that have adapted specifically for human ecologies ,COMMA species like rats and cockroaches and crows .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA for example ,COMMA rats are incredibly responsive breeders .PERIOD <BREAK>
We're seeing a population boom with crows .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I'll give you an example of that .PERIOD <BREAK>
And these crows use sticks in the wild to get insects and whatnot out of pieces of wood .PERIOD <BREAK>
They messed up and left just a stick of wire in there .PERIOD <BREAK>
So what's significant about this isn't that crows are using cars to crack nuts .PERIOD <BREAK>
And as we heard yesterday ,COMMA that's the Pandora's box that's getting human beings in trouble ,COMMA and we're starting to see it with them .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA they're used to the sound of the machine ,COMMA and they keep coming back ,COMMA and digging out these peanuts from amongst the pile of coins that's there .PERIOD <BREAK>
The main thing ,COMMA the main point of all this for me is that we can find mutually beneficial systems for these species .PERIOD <BREAK>
So my grandfather told me when I was a little girl ,COMMA If you say a word often enough ,COMMA it becomes you .PERIOD <BREAK>
Anybody out here old enough to know Studs Terkel ,COMMA that old radio man ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
The gradual slippage -- 'slippage' is the word used by the people in Watergate ,COMMA moral slippage -- it's a gradual kind of thing ,COMMA combination of things .PERIOD <BREAK>
Oh ,COMMA let me kind of tell you a funny little play bit .PERIOD <BREAK>
Just as a train is about to go ,COMMA a young couple rush in and they're just about to close the pneumatic doors .PERIOD <BREAK>
You see ,COMMA here's Huck ;SEMICOLON he's an illiterate kid ;SEMICOLON he's had no schooling ,COMMA but there's something in him .PERIOD <BREAK>
You know ,COMMA most actors want to do characters that are likeable -- well ,COMMA not always ,COMMA but the notion ,COMMA especially at a conference like this ,COMMA I like to inspire people .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I still feel as though I've got to get coffee for my male colleagues ,COMMA even though I've outlived most of them .PERIOD <BREAK>
Everything I do is word for word off a tape .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it didn't work ,COMMA didn't work .PERIOD <BREAK>
All around her head was just swollen ;SEMICOLON her head was about two sizes of its own size .PERIOD <BREAK>
He says ,COMMA 'She won't breathe' I knew immediately that she was dead .PERIOD <BREAK>
I didn't even want to accept the fact that she was dead ,COMMA so I went in and I put a mirror to her mouth -- there was no thing ,COMMA nothing ,COMMA coming out of her mouth .PERIOD <BREAK>
He said ,COMMA he said ,COMMA he said ,COMMA 'We can't ,COMMA we can't let nobody find out about this' He say ,COMMA 'You've got to help me' I agree .PERIOD I agree .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so I went to both -- two race riots ,COMMA one of which was the Los Angeles riot .PERIOD And this next piece is from that .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that trial came back with two cops going to jail and two cops declared innocent .PERIOD I was at that trial .PERIOD <BREAK>
So what she's questioning here ,COMMA she's taking a chance and questioning what justice is in society .PERIOD <BREAK>
We didn't qualify for medical treatment ,COMMA no food stamp ,COMMA no GR ,COMMA no welfare ,COMMA anything .PERIOD Many African-Americans who never work got minimum amount of money to survive .PERIOD <BREAK>
We didn't get any because we have a car and a house .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I wonder if that is really justice for them ,COMMA to get their rights in that way .PERIOD <BREAK>
But after the riot ,COMMA it's too much difference .PERIOD <BREAK>
The other reason that I don't wear shoes is just in case I really feel like I have to cuddle up and get into the feet of somebody ,COMMA walking really in somebody else's shoes .PERIOD <BREAK>
I was in a doctor's office last CAT scan ,COMMA and there was a Reader's Digest ,COMMA October 2002 .PERIOD <BREAK>
I mean ,COMMA like even when I told my wife that you want to come out here and talk to me ,COMMA she's like ,COMMA 'She's just talking ;SEMICOLON she's just being nice to you .PERIOD She's not going to do that' And then you called me up and you said you wanted to come out here and interview me and she went and looked you up on the Internet .PERIOD <BREAK>
She said ,COMMA 'Look who she is .PERIOD <BREAK>
Freedom ?QUESTIONMARK It would have to be the rodeo .PERIOD <BREAK>
I mean ,COMMA I guess it just be like -- I guess it be like the day my brother died .PERIOD <BREAK>
So check it ,COMMA I'm gonna to catch mockingbirds .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'll get some asshole at a watering hole asking what brand the ice is .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'll get the last time you lied .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'll get a lonely ,COMMA little sentence with real error in it ,COMMA Yeah ,COMMA I guess I could come inside ,COMMA but only for a minute .PERIOD <BREAK>
What does a violin have to do with technology ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
The surface of the Earth is absolutely riddled with holes ,COMMA and here we are ,COMMA right in the middle .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'm on this 'til the whole thing spreads ,COMMA with chat rooms and copycats and moms maybe tucking kids into bed singing ,COMMA Hush ,COMMA little baby ,COMMA don't say a word .PERIOD <BREAK>
Wow .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now most media companies -- television ,COMMA radio ,COMMA publishing ,COMMA games ,COMMA you name it -- they use very rigid segmentation methods in order to understand their audiences .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so the bizarre result of this is that most of our popular culture is actually based on these presumptions about our demographics .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now there's something else that we've discovered about social media that's actually quite surprising .PERIOD <BREAK>
Well ,COMMA I actually don't think that's going to be the case .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is far too simplistic .PERIOD <BREAK>
So you may be asking ,COMMA well why is it important that I know what entertains people ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
So imagine a media atmosphere that isn't dominated by lame stereotypes about gender and other demographic characteristics .PERIOD <BREAK>
Thank you so much .PERIOD <BREAK>
And she went to a neurologist who was fascinated .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the amazing thing to me is that now you would think this woman would like have excellent oral hygiene .PERIOD <BREAK>
I interviewed ,COMMA when I was working on the book ,COMMA I interviewed a woman who can think herself to orgasm .PERIOD <BREAK>
It was remarkable .PERIOD It took about one minute .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it is a fact that you can trigger spinal reflexes in dead people -- a certain kind of dead person ,COMMA a beating-heart cadaver .PERIOD <BREAK>
Obviously it wouldn't be as much fun for the person .PERIOD <BREAK>
You know ?QUESTIONMARK You can get cadavers if you work at a university .PERIOD <BREAK>
According to 1930 s marriage manual author ,COMMA Theodoor van de Velde ,COMMA a slight seminal odor can be detected on the breath of a woman within about an hour after sexual intercourse .PERIOD <BREAK>
But he wrote in this book ,COMMA Ideal Marriage -- he said that he could differentiate between the semen of a young man ,COMMA which he said had a fresh ,COMMA exhilarating smell ,COMMA and the semen of mature men ,COMMA whose semen smelled quote ,COMMA Remarkably like that of the flowers of the Spanish chestnut .PERIOD <BREAK>
And lo and behold ,COMMA the hiccups went away .PERIOD <BREAK>
It was called the upsuck theory .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is the 1950 s .PERIOD <BREAK>
I have an answer for you .PERIOD I have two answers .PERIOD <BREAK>
So now you have an evolutionary excuse .PERIOD <BREAK>
Alrighty .PERIOD There is considerable evidence for upsuck in the animal kingdom -- pigs ,COMMA for instance .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I also said to her ,COMMA Now these sows .PERIOD I mean ,COMMA you may have noticed there ,COMMA The sow doesn't look to be in the throes of ecstasy .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is the ejaculation face of the stump-tailed macaque .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is basically a penis camera on a motor .PERIOD <BREAK>
And in fact he found that in three quarters of the men the stuff just kind of slopped out .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that furthers the isolation that people like John found themselves in .PERIOD <BREAK>
But after having lost a beloved teacher in 2006 and a good friend last year to suicide ,COMMA and sitting last year at TEDActive ,COMMA I knew that I needed to step out of my silence and past my taboos to talk about an idea worth spreading -- and that is that people who have made the difficult choice to come back to life need more resources and need our help .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is the way that most of us were taught to tie our shoes .PERIOD <BREAK>
And here's how to tell .PERIOD <BREAK>
It will let you down less ,COMMA and not only that ,COMMA it looks better .PERIOD <BREAK>
Live long and prosper .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's called Tidying Up Art and it's ,COMMA as you can see ,COMMA it's more or less a picture book .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'd like to show them around so we can just ,COMMA you know -- Actually ,COMMA I managed to prepare for you some enlarged pictures -- even better .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we can see here very clearly ,COMMA it's a confusion of color .PERIOD <BREAK>
The various pictures here of the various elements of the picture -- the whole thing is unstructured .PERIOD <BREAK>
Yeah ,COMMA that's great .PERIOD <BREAK>
You can see now ,COMMA that's a good example :COLON even behaving in an orderly ,COMMA systematic way can sometimes lead to complete chaos .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's a picture by Keith Haring .PERIOD <BREAK>
In the end ,COMMA one has a list with which one then can arrange .PERIOD <BREAK>
Tidying up Rene Magritte -- this is really fun .PERIOD <BREAK>
Like books ,COMMA clothes ,COMMA toothbrush ,COMMA etc .PERIOD And it was great .PERIOD <BREAK>
But then one morning ,COMMA I hang the same little sign onto that picture by Vincent van Gogh .PERIOD <BREAK>
Here -- that's just my new proposal here for the Union Jack .PERIOD <BREAK>
yeah ,COMMA I think ,COMMA after you have seen that I have to leave anyway .PERIOD <BREAK>
One is hierarchical pores ,COMMA and the other is a macro-molecular nanoscale porosity in the material .PERIOD <BREAK>
Machines are becoming devastatingly capable of things like killing .PERIOD Right ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Those machines have no place for empathy .PERIOD <BREAK>
which was the basis of the movie Bladerunner .PERIOD <BREAK>
Even if you just try to get all of those ideas into your head by watching all those thousand TED videos ,COMMA it would actually currently take you over 250 hours to do so .PERIOD <BREAK>
Each of those TEDTalks has an average length of about 2300 words .PERIOD <BREAK>
Or Living in existential vacuum ;SEMICOLON it sucks .PERIOD <BREAK>
I mean .PERIOD <BREAK>
For example ,COMMA Dan Pink's talk on motivation ,COMMA which was pretty good if you haven't seen it :COLON Drop carrot .PERIOD Drop stick .PERIOD Bring meaning .PERIOD <BREAK>
Even then ,COMMA unfortunately ,COMMA it's not possible to summarize each TEDTalk individually .PERIOD <BREAK>
I don't know any TEDTalk that contains this .PERIOD <BREAK>
I had started out with a thousand TEDTalks and I had 600 six-word summaries for those .PERIOD <BREAK>
So I thought ,COMMA I probably have to take this one step further here and create summaries of the summaries -- and this is exactly what I did .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA he's discovering the garden .PERIOD <BREAK>
His face ,COMMA by the way ,COMMA is fully AI-driven .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now we need to have a bit more engagement ,COMMA and again ,COMMA what we can do is we can look at the body .PERIOD <BREAK>
You stand up ,COMMA and you skim the stone .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we're going to help him with this now .PERIOD <BREAK>
But this is going to be an introduction ,COMMA and this is all about the deep psychology that we're trying to use .PERIOD <BREAK>
We're trying to introduce you to what I believe is the most wonderful part ,COMMA you being able to talk in your natural voice to Milo .PERIOD <BREAK>
He's just moved house .PERIOD He's got no friends .PERIOD <BREAK>
They're always getting stressed .PERIOD <BREAK>
Milo :COLON I just really miss my old house ,COMMA that's all .PERIOD <BREAK>
But for me ,COMMA this is a wonderful opportunity where technology ,COMMA at last ,COMMA can be connected with ,COMMA where I am no longer restrained by the finger I hold in my hand -- as far as a computer game's concerned -- or by the blandness of not being noticed if you're watching a film or a book .PERIOD <BREAK>
Each of you possesses the most powerful ,COMMA dangerous and subversive trait that natural selection has ever devised .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'm talking about your language ,COMMA of course ,COMMA because it allows you to implant a thought from your mind directly into someone else's mind ,COMMA and they can attempt to do the same to you ,COMMA without either of you having to perform surgery .PERIOD <BREAK>
And just imagine the sense of wonder in a baby when it first discovers that ,COMMA merely by uttering a sound ,COMMA it can get objects to move across a room as if by magic ,COMMA and maybe even into its mouth .PERIOD <BREAK>
And this cumulative cultural adaptation ,COMMA as anthropologists call this accumulation of ideas ,COMMA is responsible for everything around you in your bustling and teeming everyday lives .PERIOD <BREAK>
And this is also true of some remote oceanic islands .PERIOD <BREAK>
This remarkable image is not a map of the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
He thought ,COMMA Oh ,COMMA I can renovate the school .PERIOD <BREAK>
She found a job ,COMMA she scouted for jobs for her classmates and her friends .PERIOD <BREAK>
She not only changed her own dynamic ,COMMA she changed her household ,COMMA she changed her family ,COMMA her village .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that is that the central moral challenge of this century is gender inequity .PERIOD <BREAK>
So some of you may be thinking ,COMMA Gosh ,COMMA that's hyperbole .PERIOD <BREAK>
And ,COMMA you know ,COMMA it happens for several reasons .PERIOD <BREAK>
There are three reasons why this is the case .PERIOD <BREAK>
When you educate a girl ,COMMA she tends to have significantly fewer kids .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's kind of like the dirty ,COMMA little secret of poverty ,COMMA which is that ,COMMA not only do poor people take in very little income ,COMMA but also ,COMMA the income that they take in ,COMMA they don't spend it very wisely ,COMMA and unfortunately ,COMMA most of that spending is done by men .PERIOD <BREAK>
The last reason has to do with women being part of the solution ,COMMA not the problem .PERIOD <BREAK>
He was speaking to an audience much like yourselves .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that does not even include those that are trafficked within country borders ,COMMA which is a substantial portion .PERIOD <BREAK>
She fought off the hyenas with that stick .PERIOD <BREAK>
She's moved out of a vicious cycle and into a virtuous cycle .PERIOD <BREAK>
Let me tell you about Saima .PERIOD <BREAK>
And then ,COMMA when she had to transport all of the embroidery goods from the village to the marketplace ,COMMA she needed someone to help her do the transport ,COMMA so she hired her husband .PERIOD <BREAK>
A few yards away was a failed chicken coop .PERIOD <BREAK>
She never broke down .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA here's the cause .PERIOD <BREAK>
Join the movement .PERIOD <BREAK>
You've all seen lots of articles on climate change ,COMMA and here's yet another New York Times article ,COMMA just like every other darn one you've seen .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we've accomplished close to zip .PERIOD <BREAK>
And there are times you might like to do something quick .PERIOD <BREAK>
Can you shade some sunlight and effectively compensate for the added CO 2 ,COMMA and produce a climate sort of back to what it was originally ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And the answer seems to be yes .PERIOD <BREAK>
It just sunk below the surface .PERIOD We weren't allowed to speak about it .PERIOD <BREAK>
And in fact ,COMMA he had some ideas to make them go away .PERIOD <BREAK>
But let's say you have sunlight hitting some particle and it's unevenly heated .PERIOD <BREAK>
So the side facing the sun is warmer ;SEMICOLON the side away ,COMMA cooler .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so you see a net force away from the sun .PERIOD <BREAK>
Because we have no way to agree about where to set the knobs .PERIOD <BREAK>
We need a broader debate .PERIOD <BREAK>
Let's say that we don't do geo-engineering ,COMMA we do what we ought to do ,COMMA which is get serious about cutting emissions .PERIOD <BREAK>
But I have a lot of reservations .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it's time to begin thinking about it ,COMMA even if the reason we're thinking about it is to construct arguments for why we shouldn't do it .PERIOD <BREAK>
And oddly ,COMMA the most notable letter of rejection I ever received came from Walt Disney World ,COMMA a seemingly innocuous site .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I wanted to see the center with my own eyes ,COMMA but what I came away with is a photograph .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it's just another place from which to observe ,COMMA and the understanding that there are no absolute ,COMMA all-knowing insiders .PERIOD <BREAK>
In this context I'll just show you a few .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is a cryopreservation unit ,COMMA and it holds the bodies of the wife and mother of cryonics pioneer Robert Ettinger ,COMMA who hoped to be awoken one day to extended life in good health ,COMMA with advancements in science and technology ,COMMA all for the cost of 35 thousand dollars ,COMMA for forever .PERIOD <BREAK>
And in this I really wanted it to resemble an early still-life painting ,COMMA so I spent some time with the smells and items .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the film was shot on 72 millimeter ,COMMA government-issue film .PERIOD <BREAK>
I investigate photography's ability to blur truth and fiction ,COMMA and its influence on memory ,COMMA which can lead to severe ,COMMA even lethal consequences .PERIOD <BREAK>
A victim or eyewitness identifies a suspected perpetrator through law enforcement's use of images .PERIOD <BREAK>
But through exposure to composite sketches ,COMMA Polaroids ,COMMA mug shots and line-ups ,COMMA eyewitness testimony can change .PERIOD <BREAK>
And he served 10 years of a life sentence .PERIOD <BREAK>
Ron Williamson .PERIOD Ron was convicted of the rape and murder of a barmaid at a club ,COMMA and served 11 years of a death sentence .PERIOD <BREAK>
Ronald Jones served eight years of a death sentence for rape and murder of a 28 -year-old woman .PERIOD <BREAK>
Some people say this is because we have better diagnosis ,COMMA and more people are being found out .PERIOD <BREAK>
For example ,COMMA these two show great growth in income ,COMMA absolutely flat happiness curves .PERIOD <BREAK>
My field ,COMMA the field of psychology ,COMMA hasn't done a whole lot to help us move forward in understanding human happiness .PERIOD <BREAK>
Emotions are short-lived intense responses to challenge and to opportunity .PERIOD <BREAK>
And each one of them allows us to click into alternate selves that tune in ,COMMA turn on ,COMMA drop out thoughts ,COMMA perceptions ,COMMA feelings and memories .PERIOD <BREAK>
We've come away from the Freudian gloom ,COMMA and people are now actively studying this .PERIOD <BREAK>
Absent from this list ,COMMA and absent from any discussions of happiness ,COMMA are happiness in another's happiness .PERIOD <BREAK>
Babies love the taste of sweet and hate the taste of bitter .PERIOD <BREAK>
Babies really are born with a lot of innate pleasures .PERIOD <BREAK>
It turned out that it wasn't ,COMMA that it really is a system of motivation ,COMMA a system of wanting .PERIOD <BREAK>
There is a profound need to belong .PERIOD <BREAK>
But there are ways in which our evolutionary history can really trip us up .PERIOD <BREAK>
So for example we have three systems that underlie reproduction ,COMMA because it's so important .PERIOD <BREAK>
There's attachment ,COMMA which is oxytocin ,COMMA and the opiates ,COMMA which says ,COMMA This is a long-term bond .PERIOD <BREAK>
So a person can be in a long term attachment ,COMMA become romantically infatuated with someone else ,COMMA and want to have sex with a third person .PERIOD <BREAK>
So if you look at questions like this ,COMMA life satisfaction ,COMMA you see life satisfaction going up with each rung of income .PERIOD <BREAK>
You see mental distress going up with lower income .PERIOD <BREAK>
But the effect is relatively small .PERIOD <BREAK>
And sure enough ,COMMA if you look at the kinds of values that come in ,COMMA you see wealth ,COMMA adventure ,COMMA achievement ,COMMA pleasure ,COMMA fun ,COMMA be respected ,COMMA before the change ,COMMA and much more post-materialist values after .PERIOD <BREAK>
I had all kinds of rats ,COMMA mice ,COMMA hamsters ,COMMA gerbils ,COMMA squirrels .PERIOD <BREAK>
Growing up in a multicultural environment ,COMMA we had African students in the house ,COMMA and I learned about their stories ,COMMA so different backgrounds ,COMMA dependency on imported know-how ,COMMA goods ,COMMA services ,COMMA exuberant cultural diversity .PERIOD <BREAK>
Princess Diana is announcing on TV that landmines form a structural barrier to any development ,COMMA which is really true .PERIOD <BREAK>
And actually ,COMMA our product -- what you see here .PERIOD <BREAK>
Rats have been used since the ' 50 s last century ,COMMA in all kinds of experiments .PERIOD <BREAK>
Rats have more genetic material allocated to olfaction than any other mammal species .PERIOD <BREAK>
So in our common language ,COMMA Dutch ,COMMA the name for TB .PERIOD <BREAK>
It gets a click sound and comes for the food reward .PERIOD <BREAK>
And by doing so ,COMMA very fast ,COMMA we can have like a second-line opinion to see which patients are positive ,COMMA which are negative .PERIOD <BREAK>
Just as an indication ,COMMA whereas a microscopist can process 40 samples in a day ,COMMA a rat can process the same amount of samples in seven minutes only .PERIOD <BREAK>
But let's stick first to tuberculosis .PERIOD <BREAK>
Throughout last year ,COMMA we've been -- depending on which intervals you take -- we've been consistently increasing case detection rates in five hospitals in Dar es Salaam between 30 and 40 percent .PERIOD <BREAK>
And there are simple things like ,COMMA for instance ,COMMA we have a small laser in the sniffer hole where the animal has to stick for five seconds .PERIOD <BREAK>
Also ,COMMA to standardize the pellets ,COMMA the food rewards ,COMMA and to semi-automate this in order to replicate this on a much larger scale and affect the lives of many more people .PERIOD <BREAK>
Here is a first prototype of our camera rat ,COMMA which is a rat with a rat backpack with a camera that can go under rubble to detect for victims after earthquake and so on .PERIOD <BREAK>
Thank you very much .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA how do you go about studying the brain ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA one recent discovery that has been made by researchers in Italy ,COMMA in Parma ,COMMA by Giacomo Rizzolatti and his colleagues ,COMMA is a group of neurons called mirror neurons ,COMMA which are on the front of the brain in the frontal lobes .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA here is a neuron that fires when I reach and grab something ,COMMA but it also fires when I watch Joe reaching and grabbing something .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's almost as though it's performing a virtual reality simulation of the other person's action .PERIOD <BREAK>
For one thing they must be involved in things like imitation and emulation .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA how do you do imitation ?QUESTIONMARK Why is imitation important ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And I claim that what happened was the sudden emergence of a sophisticated mirror neuron system ,COMMA which allowed you to emulate and imitate other people's actions .PERIOD <BREAK>
A human being ,COMMA a child ,COMMA can just watch its parent kill another polar bear ,COMMA and skin it and put the skin on its body ,COMMA fur on the body ,COMMA and learn it in one step .PERIOD What the polar bear took 100000 years to learn ,COMMA it can learn in five minutes ,COMMA maybe 10 minutes .PERIOD <BREAK>
It emerges from our understanding of basic neuroscience .PERIOD <BREAK>
For the longest time people have regarded science and humanities as being distinct .PERIOD <BREAK>
Pollen is a flower's way of making more flowers .PERIOD <BREAK>
Here is a scanning electron micrograph of a grain of pollen .PERIOD <BREAK>
The little hole in the middle ,COMMA we'll come to a bit later ,COMMA but that's for the pollen tube to come out later on .PERIOD A very tiny tube .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA that's 20 micrometers across ,COMMA that pollen grain there .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's also very biologically active ,COMMA as anyone with hay fever will understand .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the reason for that is they've got to chuck out masses and masses of pollen to have any chance of the pollen reaching another plant of the same species .PERIOD <BREAK>
Again -- this time ,COMMA sycamore -- wind-dispersed .PERIOD <BREAK>
Cool pollen ,COMMA though .PERIOD <BREAK>
Remember ,COMMA that thing is just about 30 micrometers across .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA it's much more efficient if you can get insects to do your bidding .PERIOD <BREAK>
The pollen has little barbs on it ,COMMA if we look .PERIOD <BREAK>
That tells me that it's actually been fossilized ,COMMA this pollen .PERIOD <BREAK>
Isn't that cool ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And this is where it gets interesting for forensics .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA not only does each type of pollen look different ,COMMA but each habitat has a different combination of plants .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is some pollen embedded in a cotton shirt ,COMMA similar to the one that I'm wearing now .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that is the 40 years that women have advocated .PERIOD <BREAK>
We have effective therapies now .PERIOD <BREAK>
Why are more and more women dying of ischemic heart disease ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
So in the WISE ,COMMA 15 years ago ,COMMA we started out and said ,COMMA Well wow ,COMMA there's a couple of key observations and we should probably follow up on that .PERIOD <BREAK>
had recently published that when women have heart attacks and die ,COMMA compared to men who have heart attacks and die -- and again ,COMMA this is millions of people ,COMMA happening every day -- women ,COMMA in their fatty plaque -- and this is their coronary artery ,COMMA so the main blood supply going into the heart muscle -- women erode ,COMMA men explode .PERIOD <BREAK>
EKG goes pbbrrhh ,COMMA so the doctors can see this hugely abnormal EKG .PERIOD <BREAK>
So what do you think happens to these gals ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
So unlike the CAT scans ,COMMA X-rays ,COMMA thalliums ,COMMA for women whose breast is in the way of looking at the heart ,COMMA every time we order something that has even a small amount of radiation ,COMMA we say ,COMMA Do we really need that test ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And those little red boxes are deaths .PERIOD <BREAK>
One of the things that we say about all of this female physiology -- because again ,COMMA as much as we're talking about women and heart disease ,COMMA women do ,COMMA on average ,COMMA have better longevity than men -- is that unfolding the secrets of female physiology and understanding that is going to help men and women .PERIOD <BREAK>
So we're 35 years behind .PERIOD <BREAK>
Women participate .PERIOD <BREAK>
Deb Roy :COLON This moment and thousands of other moments special for us were captured in our home because in every room in the house ,COMMA if you looked up ,COMMA you'd see a camera and a microphone ,COMMA and if you looked down ,COMMA you'd get this bird's-eye view of the room .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is my wife and I cooking breakfast in the kitchen ,COMMA and as we move through space and through time ,COMMA a very everyday pattern of life in the kitchen .PERIOD <BREAK>
In order to convert this opaque ,COMMA 90000 hours of video into something that we could start to see ,COMMA we use motion analysis to pull out ,COMMA as we move through space and through time ,COMMA what we call space-time worms .PERIOD <BREAK>
No video here ,COMMA so you can focus on the sound ,COMMA the acoustics ,COMMA of a new kind of trajectory :COLON gaga to water .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is one of the first results that came out of our study a little over a year ago that really surprised us .PERIOD <BREAK>
So it appears that all three primary caregivers -- myself ,COMMA my wife and our nanny -- were systematically and ,COMMA I would think ,COMMA subconsciously restructuring our language to meet him at the birth of a word and bring him gently into more complex language .PERIOD <BREAK>
What about the visual context ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And there's our nanny by the door .PERIOD <BREAK>
And what we've done is use the word water to tag that moment ,COMMA that bit of activity .PERIOD <BREAK>
Three of the key people in this project ,COMMA Philip DeCamp ,COMMA Rony Kubat and Brandon Roy are pictured here .PERIOD <BREAK>
Each of the links that you're seeing rendered here is an actual connection made between something someone said and a piece of content .PERIOD <BREAK>
We call this a co-viewing clique ,COMMA a virtual living room if you will .PERIOD <BREAK>
And there are fascinating dynamics at play .PERIOD <BREAK>
So this person is a key link in connecting mass media and social media together .PERIOD <BREAK>
Come here .PERIOD <BREAK>
Oh ,COMMA boy .PERIOD <BREAK>
And primary visual cortex sees just simple geometry ,COMMA just the simplest of shapes .PERIOD <BREAK>
And this is the part of the brain that will recognize what something is .PERIOD <BREAK>
You'd be activating the dorsal stream if you did that .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it's the part that feels .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now we've augmented this and spatialized this information .PERIOD <BREAK>
We make meaning by seeing ,COMMA by an act of visual interrogation .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is a time-lapse view of it .PERIOD <BREAK>
And this is an emerging set of technologies that use large-screen displays with intelligent calculation in the background to make the invisible visible .PERIOD <BREAK>
You can see the three-light transom there with the eyebrow windows -- certainly an architectural antique headed to the landfill .PERIOD <BREAK>
Even the lockset is probably worth 200 dollars .PERIOD <BREAK>
Then ,COMMA looking up in the turret ,COMMA you see there are bulges and pokes and sags and so forth .PERIOD <BREAK>
Then ,COMMA on the can it says ,COMMA This is the famous Budweiser beer ,COMMA we know of no other beer ,COMMA blah ,COMMA blah ,COMMA blah .PERIOD <BREAK>
This little house here ,COMMA those branches there are made out of Bois D'arc or Osage Orange ,COMMA and these pictures will keep scrolling as I talk a little bit .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's one of those new chocolate cell phones .PERIOD <BREAK>
It only rattles that expected pattern and unity of structural features .PERIOD <BREAK>
On the one hand ,COMMA we have an Apollonian perspective ,COMMA which is very crisp and premeditated and intellectualized and perfect .PERIOD <BREAK>
The Dionysian personality takes the picture and goes .PERIOD <BREAK>
Oops ,COMMA scratch ,COMMA dumpster .PERIOD <BREAK>
And here's a story :COLON Jim Tulles ,COMMA one of the guys I trained ,COMMA I said ,COMMA Jim ,COMMA it's time now .PERIOD <BREAK>
Jim ,COMMA now it's time .PERIOD You're the down ,COMMA oh .PERIOD <BREAK>
Good call ,COMMA Tulles .PERIOD From now on ,COMMA you guys hit this pile first .PERIOD <BREAK>
But once in a while you get access to the control room ,COMMA and then you can kind of mess with the dials .PERIOD <BREAK>
How disgusting .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's a pretty quick read .PERIOD <BREAK>
But as soon as you walk in ,COMMA I go ,COMMA Ooh .PERIOD Spaghetti sauce there .PERIOD <BREAK>
I feel that expectation ,COMMA and so I accommodate it ,COMMA and I'm living my life according to what you expect me to do .PERIOD <BREAK>
Wildebeests don't hang with lions because lions eat wildebeests .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so you see this in junior high a lot .PERIOD <BREAK>
On the bottom tier we have basic needs -- shelter ,COMMA clothing ,COMMA food ,COMMA water ,COMMA mating and so forth .PERIOD <BREAK>
We can't even afford to eat anything except beans .PERIOD <BREAK>
We're in trouble .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it raises an existential question ,COMMA which is ,COMMA if I'm having this experience of complete connection and full consciousness ,COMMA why am I not visible in the photograph ,COMMA and where is this time and place ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
This is a police photo .PERIOD That's actually my car .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'm put on full life support ,COMMA and I have a massive stroke ,COMMA and my brain drops into a coma .PERIOD <BREAK>
And this is how we began .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now you also continue to watch as consciousness evolved to the point that here in India ,COMMA in Madhya Pradesh ,COMMA there's one of the two oldest known pieces of rock art found .PERIOD <BREAK>
While I was producing in Los Angeles ,COMMA I never thought about it for a second .PERIOD <BREAK>
Here's my brain .PERIOD <BREAK>
And this person is particularly interesting .PERIOD <BREAK>
The craniomandibular system is critical to that .PERIOD <BREAK>
If that sounds like a very ,COMMA very strange thing to say and rather a bold statement -- How can the jaw affect the entire body ?QUESTIONMARK -- let me simply point out to you ,COMMA if I ask you tomorrow to put one grain of sand between your teeth and go for a nice long walk ,COMMA how far would you last before you had to remove that grain of sand ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
That tiny misalignment .PERIOD <BREAK>
Bear in mind ,COMMA there are no nerves in the teeth .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's why the same between the before and after that this shows ,COMMA it's hard to see the difference .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is an MRI MRA MRV ,COMMA a volumetric MRI .PERIOD <BREAK>
I've brought with me ,COMMA from Southern California ,COMMA the FM device .PERIOD <BREAK>
And when I came out of my coma ,COMMA I recognized my family ,COMMA but I didn't remember my own past .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I whispered the good news through my broken jaw ,COMMA which was wired shut ,COMMA to my night nurse .PERIOD <BREAK>
And during my time in coma ,COMMA she had been laid to rest in her hometown of Phoenix .PERIOD <BREAK>
You know ,COMMA when I heard Simon's -- please sit down ;SEMICOLON I just want to talk to him for a second -- when I read his book ,COMMA I went to LA to meet him .PERIOD <BREAK>
The thing that amazed me is the painstaking detail with which he has written every hospital he has been to ,COMMA every treatment he got ,COMMA every near-miss he had ,COMMA and how accidentally he stumbled upon innovations .PERIOD <BREAK>
Tell a little bit about what you're wearing on your leg .PERIOD <BREAK>
Because the chimpanzee would score half right if I gave them two bananas with Sri Lanka and Turkey .PERIOD They would be right half of the cases .PERIOD <BREAK>
I did also an unethical study of the professors of the Karolinska Institute -- that hands out the Nobel Prize in Medicine ,COMMA and they are on par with the chimpanzee there .PERIOD <BREAK>
Well ,COMMA I first discovered that the textbook was Tintin ,COMMA mainly .PERIOD <BREAK>
And what do you mean with Western world ?QUESTIONMARK I said .PERIOD <BREAK>
And 1962 ,COMMA there was really a group of countries here that was industrialized countries ,COMMA and they had small families and long lives .PERIOD <BREAK>
One dollar ,COMMA 10 dollars or 100 dollars per day .PERIOD <BREAK>
There's a little hump here .PERIOD But there are people all the way .PERIOD <BREAK>
We heard it in other forms .PERIOD And who are these ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Where are the different countries ?QUESTIONMARK I can show you Africa .PERIOD <BREAK>
The problem in the world was the poverty in Asia .PERIOD And if I now let the world move forward ,COMMA you will see that while population increase ,COMMA there are hundreds of millions in Asia getting out of poverty and some others getting into poverty ,COMMA and this is the pattern we have today .PERIOD <BREAK>
I can go here and I can split sub-Saharan Africa into its countries .PERIOD <BREAK>
And when it burst ,COMMA the size of its country bubble is the size of the population .PERIOD <BREAK>
Today ,COMMA we don't have to go to Cuba to find a healthy country in Latin America .PERIOD <BREAK>
The richest 20 percent of Ugandans are there .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we started to write software which could link the data like this .PERIOD <BREAK>
So I first went to Copenhagen because I thought ,COMMA well ,COMMA maybe I could become a biochemist ,COMMA but I discovered biochemistry was very boring .PERIOD <BREAK>
But Wilkins ,COMMA you know ,COMMA thought DNA was the best bet ,COMMA and he showed this x-ray photograph .PERIOD <BREAK>
And there I met Francis Crick .PERIOD <BREAK>
I went there without knowing him .PERIOD He was 35 .PERIOD I was 23 .PERIOD <BREAK>
And within a day ,COMMA we had decided that maybe we could take a shortcut to finding the structure of DNA .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the reason for doing so ,COMMA at the center of this photograph ,COMMA is Linus Pauling .PERIOD About six months before ,COMMA he proposed the alpha helical structure for proteins .PERIOD And in doing so ,COMMA he banished the man out on the right ,COMMA Sir Lawrence Bragg ,COMMA who was the Cavendish professor .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is a photograph several years later ,COMMA when Bragg had cause to smile .PERIOD <BREAK>
And they had the wisdom to say no .PERIOD So he didn't have it .PERIOD <BREAK>
But there was ones in the literature .PERIOD <BREAK>
So this was ,COMMA you know ,COMMA unexpected from the world's -- -- and so ,COMMA it was held together by hydrogen bonds between phosphate groups .PERIOD <BREAK>
And a month after we got the Pauling manuscript -- I should say I took the manuscript to London ,COMMA and showed the people .PERIOD <BREAK>
Well ,COMMA we got the answer on the 28 th February ' 53 .PERIOD <BREAK>
So I changed the locations ,COMMA and then we found the base pairing ,COMMA and Francis immediately said the chains run in absolute directions .PERIOD <BREAK>
So we saw how genetic information is carried .PERIOD <BREAK>
It didn't yield .PERIOD It didn't give good x-ray photographs .PERIOD <BREAK>
It was really ,COMMA you know ,COMMA sort of a shitty time .PERIOD <BREAK>
Well ,COMMA at that time -- I should go back .PERIOD <BREAK>
And then ,COMMA they learned how to read the letters for the code .PERIOD <BREAK>
There's a chip there ,COMMA a conventional one .PERIOD Then there's one made by a photolithography by a company in Madison called NimbleGen ,COMMA which is way ahead of Affymetrix .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we use their technique .PERIOD <BREAK>
Which is ,COMMA all of us have about 10 places in our genome where we've lost a gene or gained another one .PERIOD <BREAK>
Actually ,COMMA it's a really big idea .PERIOD <BREAK>
And they were going to spend the rest of their lives ,COMMA usually ,COMMA in this iron lung to breathe for them .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it happened so fast in the United States ,COMMA however ,COMMA that even just last month Jon Stewart said this :COLON Jon Stewart :COLON Where is polio still active ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
They had come from thousands of miles away .PERIOD <BREAK>
It doesn't survive in the environment hardly at all .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we've got pretty good vaccines ,COMMA as I've just showed you .PERIOD <BREAK>
So those are the kind of stakes that we're after .PERIOD <BREAK>
So it was a massive effort .PERIOD <BREAK>
We've had to create one of the largest social movements in history .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now giving the polio vaccine is simple .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now it took years to build up the infrastructure for polio eradication -- more than 15 years ,COMMA much longer than it should have -- but once it was built ,COMMA the results were striking .PERIOD <BREAK>
Last year ,COMMA it was 1000 .PERIOD <BREAK>
We should abandon this idea of eradication .PERIOD <BREAK>
Let's settle for control -- that's good enough .PERIOD <BREAK>
Umar was paralyzed for life .PERIOD <BREAK>
As you probably can't see the detail here ,COMMA but this is his report card ,COMMA and you'll see ,COMMA he's got perfect scores .PERIOD <BREAK>
But you know I'd love to be able to tell you that Umar is a typical kid with polio these days ,COMMA but it's not true .PERIOD <BREAK>
The new vaccine had twice the impact on these last couple of viruses as the old vaccine had ,COMMA and we immediately started using this .PERIOD <BREAK>
Well ,COMMA in a couple of months we had to get it out of production .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we didn't start with the easy places .PERIOD <BREAK>
So this morning at about seven o'clock ,COMMA I decided that we'd try to drive Chris and the production crew here berserk by downloading all of our data from India again ,COMMA so that you could see something that's just unfolding today ,COMMA which proves that the impossible is possible .PERIOD <BREAK>
Today marks exactly six months -- and for the first time in history ,COMMA not a single child has been paralyzed in Uttar Pradesh or Bihar .PERIOD <BREAK>
We have the chance to write an entirely new polio-free chapter in human history .PERIOD <BREAK>
Beverly Joubert :COLON We are truly passionate about the African wilderness and protecting the African wilderness ,COMMA and so what we've done is we've focused on iconic cats .PERIOD <BREAK>
But one of the things that science really lets us down on is that personality ,COMMA that individual personality that these animals have .PERIOD <BREAK>
Well ,COMMA we needn't have worried .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we could only find this by pushing ourselves ,COMMA by going where no sane person should go -- not without some prompting ,COMMA by the way ,COMMA from Beverly -- and just pushing the envelope ,COMMA going out there ,COMMA pushing our vehicle ,COMMA pushing ourselves .PERIOD <BREAK>
We don't always get that right ,COMMA and on this particular day ,COMMA we seriously underestimated the depth .PERIOD <BREAK>
But that's ,COMMA I think ,COMMA what this is all about ,COMMA is that these individuals have these personalities and characters .PERIOD <BREAK>
Sleep deprivation is extreme .PERIOD <BREAK>
But ,COMMA for 10 years ,COMMA we tried to capture lions and elephants together -- and never ever managed until this particular night .PERIOD <BREAK>
This elephant ,COMMA against overwhelming odds ,COMMA simply gives up hope .PERIOD <BREAK>
But by the same token ,COMMA you can get your hope back again .PERIOD <BREAK>
Beverly sits on the one side where all her camera gear is ,COMMA and I'm on the other side where my space is .PERIOD <BREAK>
These are precious to us ,COMMA these divides .PERIOD <BREAK>
But when this little cub saw that I had vacated my seat and climbed to the back to get some camera gear ,COMMA she came in like a curious cat to come and investigate .PERIOD <BREAK>
And of course ,COMMA we knew now that she was going to survive .PERIOD <BREAK>
It was absolutely amazing when she picked it up to safety ,COMMA protecting it from the hyena .PERIOD <BREAK>
But I have to tell you -- everybody always asks ,COMMA What happened to the baby baboon ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
We had to deal with these individual personalities .PERIOD <BREAK>
There's an immense amount of poaching as well ,COMMA and so possibly the same amount .PERIOD <BREAK>
Richard Feynman compared the accuracy of quantum theories -- experimental predictions -- to specifying the width of North America to within one hair's breadth of accuracy .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the familiar illustration is the nucleus of an atom is a fly in the middle of a sports stadium and the next atom is in the next sports stadium .PERIOD <BREAK>
As an evolutionary biologist ,COMMA I'd say this :COLON our brains have evolved to help us survive within the orders of magnitude of size and speed which our bodies operate at .PERIOD We never evolved to navigate in the world of atoms .PERIOD <BREAK>
Moving to the other end of the scale ,COMMA our ancestors never had to navigate through the cosmos at speeds close to the speed of light .PERIOD If they had ,COMMA our brains would be much better at understanding Einstein .PERIOD I want to give the name Middle World to the medium-scaled environment in which we've evolved the ability to take act -- nothing to do with Middle Earth .PERIOD <BREAK>
He stared at his wall in Arlington ,COMMA Virginia ,COMMA and decided to do it .PERIOD <BREAK>
Then ,COMMA General Stubblebine banged his nose hard on the wall of his office .PERIOD Stubblebine ,COMMA who commanded 16000 soldiers ,COMMA was confounded by his continual failure to walk through the wall .PERIOD <BREAK>
I have every reason to think it's true ;SEMICOLON I was reading Playboy because I ,COMMA myself ,COMMA had an article in it .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that's because in Middle World ,COMMA air friction is always there .PERIOD <BREAK>
We have this tendency to think that only solid ,COMMA material things are really things at all .PERIOD Waves of electromagnetic fluctuation in a vacuum seem unreal .PERIOD <BREAK>
Steve Grand points out that you and I are ,COMMA ourselves ,COMMA more like a wave than a permanent thing .PERIOD <BREAK>
After all ,COMMA you really were there at the time ,COMMA weren't you ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Not a single atom that is in your body today was there when that event took place .PERIOD Matter flows from place to place and momentarily comes together to be you .PERIOD <BREAK>
So really isn't a word that we should use with simple confidence .PERIOD <BREAK>
The fact that the bat uses echoes in pitch darkness to input the current variables to its model ,COMMA while the swallow uses light ,COMMA is incidental .PERIOD <BREAK>
Haldane guesses that a dog would probably be able to place the acids in the order of their molecular weights by their smells ,COMMA just as a man could place a number of piano wires in the order of their lengths by means of their notes .PERIOD <BREAK>
We're blind to all frequencies outside that ,COMMA unless we use instruments to help us .PERIOD <BREAK>
One way to think about that is by counting planets .PERIOD <BREAK>
In short ,COMMA when we're thinking like academics ,COMMA we regard people as elaborate and complicated machines ,COMMA like computers or cars ,COMMA but when we revert to being human we behave more like Basil Fawlty ,COMMA who ,COMMA we remember ,COMMA thrashed his car to teach it a lesson when it wouldn't start on gourmet night .PERIOD <BREAK>
Personification and the imputing of intentional purpose is such a brilliantly successful way to model humans ,COMMA it's hardly surprising the same modeling software often seizes control when we're trying to think about entities for which it's not appropriate ,COMMA like Basil Fawlty with his car or like millions of deluded people with the universe as a whole .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so this basically led me to a subject called cymatics .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA cymatics is the process of visualizing sound by basically vibrating a medium such as sand or water ,COMMA as you can see there .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA what excites me about cymatics ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
It's like a looking glass into a hidden world .PERIOD <BREAK>
We can also use cymatics for healing and education .PERIOD <BREAK>
This image here is created from a snippet of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony playing through a cymatic device .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we can evolve this exploration of the substance of things not seen .PERIOD Thank you .PERIOD <BREAK>

Now ,COMMA most of you have figured out that this was a prank ,COMMA and actually a very ,COMMA very good one .PERIOD <BREAK>
Because what happens on a social network is you interact with the people that you have chosen to interact with .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the reason it shouldn't be is that on any day you can go into Trending Topics .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now for me ,COMMA I'm surprised by this ,COMMA because this wasn't how the internet was supposed to be .PERIOD <BREAK>
We're heading to the future of bits ,COMMA where everything is speedy ,COMMA it's weightless .PERIOD <BREAK>
Here's what I think is going on .PERIOD <BREAK>
It includes things like the Internet cables .PERIOD <BREAK>
When we stop looking at the infrastructure that makes connection possible ,COMMA and we look at what actually happens ,COMMA we start realizing that the world doesn't work quite the same way that we think it does .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's down to about 12 to 15 percent .PERIOD <BREAK>
Even within Wikipedias ,COMMA where we're creating their own content online ,COMMA there's a heavy bias towards the place where a lot of the Wikipedia authors are based ,COMMA rather than to the rest of the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
You probably won't .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is a team of bloggers from around the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
But the more that I think about it ,COMMA the more that I think that a few things that we have learned along the way are interesting lessons for how we would rewire if we we wanted to use the web to have a wider world .PERIOD <BREAK>
In this case -- the map of the world at night by NASA -- they're dark literally because of lack of electricity .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'm also guessing that most of you don't even speak Chinese -- which is sort of sad if you think about it ,COMMA as it's now the most represented language on the internet .PERIOD <BREAK>
They put it online for free .PERIOD <BREAK>
My guess is at least one of them has something interesting to say .PERIOD <BREAK>
And search is terrific if you know what you're looking for .PERIOD <BREAK>
She has to know something about what stories are available .PERIOD <BREAK>
I know Amira .PERIOD <BREAK>

And the house that John Wilkes Booth planned the assassination of Abraham Lincoln is actually also now a Chinese restaurant called Wok 'n Roll ,COMMA on H Street in Washington .PERIOD <BREAK>
The short answer is ,COMMA actually ,COMMA they're from Japan .PERIOD <BREAK>
The original name in my book was actually called The Long March of General Tso ,COMMA and he has marched very far indeed ,COMMA because he is sweet ,COMMA he is fried ,COMMA and he is chicken -- all things that Americans love .PERIOD <BREAK>
He's retired ,COMMA deaf and plays a lot of Mahjong .PERIOD <BREAK>
But in China ,COMMA this guy's actually known for war and not chicken .PERIOD <BREAK>
I like to say chop suey's the biggest culinary joke that one culture has ever played on another ,COMMA because chop suey ,COMMA if you translate into Chinese ,COMMA means tsap sui ,COMMA which ,COMMA if you translate back ,COMMA means odds and ends .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now back then ,COMMA the Americans were not clamoring to eat Chinese food .PERIOD <BREAK>
There is West Indian Chinese food ,COMMA there's Jamaican Chinese food ,COMMA there is Middle Eastern Chinese food ,COMMA there's Mauritian Chinese food .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is a dish called Magic Bowl that I discovered .PERIOD <BREAK>

It wasn't that ,COMMA so they're like ,COMMA OK ,COMMA let's look at television ,COMMA so they looked at an episode of Lost .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA I don't have a TV ,COMMA which makes me a freak ,COMMA but very productive ,COMMA and -- -- and this episode of Lost ,COMMA I understand ,COMMA where the overweight guy has a lucky number which was not a lucky number ,COMMA which was how long they'd been on the island ,COMMA but they looked ,COMMA and the numbers did not match .PERIOD <BREAK>
This actually is a slip that one of the winners had ,COMMA because the Tennessee lottery security officials were like ,COMMA oh ,COMMA no -- like ,COMMA this can't be true .PERIOD <BREAK>

Finally ,COMMA I would schedule -- all my major surgical cases ,COMMA I was scheduling them for 12 ,COMMA one o'clock in the afternoon ,COMMA because I couldn't get out of bed before about 11 o'clock .PERIOD <BREAK>
And my colleagues ,COMMA who had known me since medical school in that place ,COMMA said ,COMMA Don't worry ,COMMA chap .PERIOD Six weeks ,COMMA you're back in the operating room .PERIOD Everything's going to be great .PERIOD <BREAK>
You've seen this painting by Edvard Munch ,COMMA The Scream .PERIOD Every moment was a scream .PERIOD <BREAK>

Any of the results along the spectrum ,COMMA from pretty bad to terrible ,COMMA terrible ,COMMA terrible is going to happen .PERIOD If he does the best he can ,COMMA he will have no further obsessions ,COMMA probably no depression ,COMMA but his affect will be dulled ,COMMA he will never go back to surgery ,COMMA he will never be the loving father that he was to his two children ,COMMA his life will be changed .PERIOD If he has the usual result ,COMMA he will end up like 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' And you know about that ,COMMA just essentially in a stupor the rest of his life .PERIOD <BREAK>
Plugged me into the wires ,COMMA put me to sleep ,COMMA gave me the muscle relaxant .PERIOD <BREAK>
But ,COMMA lo and behold ,COMMA by 16 ,COMMA by 17 ,COMMA there were demonstrable differences in the way I felt .PERIOD <BREAK>
It was as though those tightly coiled wires in my head had been disconnected and I could think clearly .PERIOD <BREAK>
My children came back to live with us .PERIOD <BREAK>
We had two more children after that .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's been ,COMMA as I said ,COMMA close to 30 years .PERIOD <BREAK>
Every once in a while ,COMMA I get somewhat depressed and a little obsessional .PERIOD <BREAK>

I hope it happens to none of you ,COMMA but it will probably happen to a small percentage of you .PERIOD <BREAK>
Would you describe that as global citizenship ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
I believe the concept of global citizenship will simply grow out of people talking to each other across continents .PERIOD <BREAK>
But people get excited about this idea of global citizenship ,COMMA but then they get confused a bit again when they start thinking about patriotism ,COMMA and how to combine these two .PERIOD <BREAK>
When you actually look at the motor of the world economy ,COMMA it cannot move forward unless there is trade between the different countries .PERIOD <BREAK>
Well I think we can persuade people that what is necessary for Britain's long-term interests ,COMMA what is necessary for America's long-term interests ,COMMA is proper engagement with the rest of the world ,COMMA and taking the action that is necessary .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we have got to realize that if we don't link up with those people who are sensible voices and democratic voices in Africa ,COMMA to work together for common causes ,COMMA then the danger of Al Qaeda and related groups making progress in Africa is very big .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I wouldn't like anything that is said today to suggest that I am diminishing the importance of the responsibility that each individual leader has for their own country .PERIOD <BREAK>
Where was the early warning systems ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
All these things have happened .PERIOD <BREAK>
Even if ,COMMA as a human being ,COMMA you believe that ,COMMA you can't say that .PERIOD You're elected for Britain's interests .PERIOD <BREAK>
Since then ,COMMA the world has moved forward ,COMMA partly as a result of what happened with the Holocaust ,COMMA and people's concern about the rights of individuals within territories where they need protection ,COMMA partly because of what we saw in Rwanda ,COMMA partly because of what we saw in Bosnia .PERIOD <BREAK>
The idea of the responsibility to protect all individuals who are in situations where they are at humanitarian risk is now being established as a principle which governs the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA while I can't automatically say that Britain will rush to the aid of any citizen of any country ,COMMA in danger ,COMMA I can say that Britain is in a position where we're working with other countries so that this idea that you have a responsibility to protect people who are victims of either genocide or humanitarian attack ,COMMA is something that is accepted by the whole world .PERIOD <BREAK>
Yes .PERIOD And then of course the theory is still that those talks get rent apart by different countries fighting over their own individual interests .PERIOD <BREAK>
America has made its first disposition on this with the bill that President Obama should be congratulated for getting through Congress .PERIOD <BREAK>
And God shook his head and said ,COMMA Not this year ,COMMA not this decade ,COMMA perhaps not even in your lifetime .PERIOD <BREAK>
And Bill Clinton walked away in tears because he had failed to get what he wanted .PERIOD <BREAK>
So that's kind of a bold statement .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it's technological ,COMMA so it can do things like microelectronics ,COMMA and maybe photonics do .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the material looks something like this .PERIOD <BREAK>
The process of discovery ,COMMA generally ,COMMA is inspired by nature .PERIOD <BREAK>
They find their way to self-assemble .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we can store information that's film with water and protein .PERIOD <BREAK>
You can imagine that then maybe you can use a pure protein to guide light ,COMMA and so we've made optical fibers .PERIOD <BREAK>
You can do electronic pieces that fold and wrap .PERIOD <BREAK>
You can implant it in the body without needing to retrieve what is implanted .PERIOD <BREAK>
And you see there ,COMMA it gets reintegrated in tissue .PERIOD <BREAK>
So you have a clock ,COMMA you have protein ,COMMA and now a silk cup like this can be thrown away without guilt -- unlike the polystyrene cups that unfortunately fill our landfills everyday .PERIOD <BREAK>
So it allows for the recovery of what we've stored before .PERIOD <BREAK>
Some people in the last decade or two have started creating artwork with technology .PERIOD <BREAK>
You can learn something from the robot about the community that you're in .PERIOD <BREAK>
You guys are looking good out there .PERIOD <BREAK>
Data :COLON Here's the first one .PERIOD <BREAK>
One of them falls to the ground .PERIOD <BREAK>
I can help .PERIOD <BREAK>
You've been a great audience .PERIOD <BREAK>
There's a lot more to come .PERIOD <BREAK>
Then he said ,COMMA But really ,COMMA Sarah ,COMMA you could have worked harder !EXCLAMATIONMARK Can't you see it's really too small ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Indeed ,COMMA it's rather small .PERIOD <BREAK>
One day ,COMMA while my father was working on a file for us to obtain French nationality ,COMMA I happened to see some documents that caught my attention .PERIOD <BREAK>
These are real !EXCLAMATIONMARK <BREAK>
So ,COMMA his story .PERIOD My father was born in Argentina .PERIOD <BREAK>
This coincided with the time when he threw himself body and soul into chemistry because it was the only consolation for his sadness .PERIOD <BREAK>
It was my grandfather who decided they needed false documents .PERIOD <BREAK>
But it was he who went to meet a man from the Resistance .PERIOD <BREAK>
In those times documents had hard covers ,COMMA they were filled in by hand ,COMMA and they stated your job .PERIOD <BREAK>
He started inventing all kind of things -- with some materials he invented a centrifuge using a bicycle wheel .PERIOD <BREAK>
Time passed ,COMMA and they thought he had surely forgotten them ,COMMA at first .PERIOD <BREAK>
And then I understood that asking my father so many questions was stirring up a whole past he probably didn't feel like talking about because it was painful .PERIOD <BREAK>
In Africa there were countries fighting for their independence :COLON Guinea ,COMMA Guinea-Bissau ,COMMA Angola .PERIOD <BREAK>
There was also Latin America .PERIOD <BREAK>
He said no .PERIOD <BREAK>
We live on a human-dominated planet ,COMMA putting unprecedented pressure on the systems on Earth .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is a scientific journey on the challenges facing humanity in the global phase of sustainability .PERIOD <BREAK>
So I thought I'd bring her with me today on stage ,COMMA to have her as a witness of a remarkable journey ,COMMA which humbly reminds us of the period of grace we've had over the past 10000 years .PERIOD <BREAK>
Here ,COMMA used as a proxy ,COMMA temperature variability .PERIOD <BREAK>
It was a jumpy ride .PERIOD 80000 years back in a crisis ,COMMA we leave Africa ,COMMA we colonize Australia in another crisis ,COMMA 60000 years back ,COMMA we leave Asia for Europe in another crisis ,COMMA 40000 years back ,COMMA and then we enter the remarkably stable Holocene phase ,COMMA the only period in the whole history of the planet ,COMMA that we know of ,COMMA that can support human development .PERIOD <BREAK>
The majority of the planet ,COMMA aspiring for development ,COMMA having the right for development ,COMMA are in large aspiring for an unsustainable lifestyle ,COMMA a momentous pressure .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA you would have wished the climate pressure to hit a strong planet ,COMMA a resilient planet ,COMMA but unfortunately ,COMMA the third pressure is the ecosystem decline .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA if we have evidence ,COMMA which we now have ,COMMA that wetlands ,COMMA forests ,COMMA [unclear] monsoon system ,COMMA the rainforests ,COMMA behave in this nonlinear way .PERIOD <BREAK>
And could we even ,COMMA thanks to major advancements in Earth systems science ,COMMA identify the thresholds ,COMMA the points where we may expect nonlinear change ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Now this is the Big Bang equivalent then of human development within the safe operating space of the planetary boundaries .PERIOD <BREAK>
In the ' 60 s already ,COMMA through the green revolution and the Haber-Bosch process of fixing nitrogen from the atmosphere -- you know ,COMMA human's today take out more nitrogen from the atmosphere than the whole biosphere does naturally as a whole .PERIOD <BREAK>
There's good news here ,COMMA for example ,COMMA from Latin America ,COMMA where plow-based farming systems of the ' 50 s and ' 60 s led farming basically to a dead-end ,COMMA with lower and lower yields ,COMMA degrading the organic matter and fundamental problems at the livelihood levels in Paraguay ,COMMA Uruguay and a number of countries ,COMMA Brazil ,COMMA leading to innovation and entrepreneurship among farmers in partnership with scientists into an agricultural revolution of zero tillage systems combined with mulch farming with locally adapted technologies ,COMMA which today ,COMMA for example ,COMMA in some countries ,COMMA have led to a tremendous increase in area under mulch ,COMMA zero till farming which ,COMMA not only produces more food ,COMMA but also sequesters carbon .PERIOD <BREAK>
It has to basically do this on current land .PERIOD <BREAK>
Elinor Ostrom ,COMMA the latest Nobel laureate of economics ,COMMA clearly shows empirically across the world that we can govern the commons if we invest in trust ,COMMA local ,COMMA action-based partnerships and cross-scale institutional innovations ,COMMA where local actors ,COMMA together ,COMMA can deal with the global commons at a large scale .PERIOD <BREAK>
where you give the guaranteed price for investment in renewable energy ,COMMA but you can subsidize electricity to poor people .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA there is scientific evidence .PERIOD <BREAK>
I was asked to come here and speak about creation .PERIOD <BREAK>
You know ,COMMA creation is what put that dog in that picture ,COMMA and creativity is what makes us see a chicken on his hindquarters .PERIOD <BREAK>
And another point -- why I'm here -- is that the day I went to pick up the Plexiglas trophy ,COMMA I rented a tuxedo for the first time in my life ,COMMA picked the thing -- didn't have any friends .PERIOD <BREAK>
Somebody was hitting somebody else with brass knuckles .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that's how -- with this money I paid for a ticket to come to the United States in 1983 ,COMMA and that's very -- the basic reason I'm talking to you here today :COLON because I got shot .PERIOD <BREAK>
Unfortunately ,COMMA it has become obsolete because it was designed for Atari platform .PERIOD <BREAK>
But I was still ,COMMA you know -- this is a kitty cloud .PERIOD <BREAK>
The Snail .PERIOD <BREAK>
And your eye doesn't know which level to read .PERIOD <BREAK>
And they would look at it -- Ah ,COMMA it's a pencil drawing .PERIOD <BREAK>
It had a physicality ,COMMA and you start going deeper and deeper into sort of narrative that goes this way ,COMMA towards the image .PERIOD So this is Monkey with Leica .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I wanted to deal with other subjects .PERIOD <BREAK>
I got some photographs from them .PERIOD <BREAK>
And Jackson Pollock also .PERIOD <BREAK>
I used the dust at the Whitney Museum to render some pieces of their collection .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I picked minimalist pieces because they're about specificity .PERIOD <BREAK>
They do a DNA scan of this ,COMMA they will come up with a great mailing list .PERIOD <BREAK>
Also ,COMMA the reference to Gerhard Richter's use of color charts -- and the idea also entering another realm of representation that's very common to us today ,COMMA which is the bit map .PERIOD <BREAK>
I opt for very simple line drawings -- kind of stupid looking .PERIOD <BREAK>
On the other hand ,COMMA you know ,COMMA I paid like three dollars ,COMMA I think -- and I went to a warehouse in Queens to see a version of Othello by an amateur group .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's why we pay to go to magic shows and things like that .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the information is there twice -- one on each strand -- which is important ,COMMA because when new cells are formed ,COMMA these strands come apart ,COMMA new strands are synthesized with the old ones as templates in an almost perfect process .PERIOD <BREAK>
So an interesting question is ,COMMA what happened when we met ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
So this involves a lot of technical issues in how you extract the DNA ,COMMA how you convert it to a form you can sequence .PERIOD <BREAK>
The same is true if we look at a Chinese individual versus an African ,COMMA the Neanderthal will match the Chinese individual more often .PERIOD <BREAK>
And further back ,COMMA 800000 years ago is there a common origin with present day humans .PERIOD <BREAK>
But we do find it in Papua New Guinea and in other islands in Melanesia and the Pacific .PERIOD <BREAK>
We don't know quite where the borders between these people were ,COMMA but we know that in Southern Siberia ,COMMA there were both Neanderthals and Denisovans at least at some time in the past .PERIOD <BREAK>
And since we mixed elsewhere ,COMMA I'm pretty sure that one day ,COMMA when we will perhaps have a genome of also these earlier forms in Africa ,COMMA we will find that they have also mixed with early modern humans in Africa .PERIOD <BREAK>
And if I were to write a volume ,COMMA it would be called ,COMMA Artists Who Have Led My Exhibitions because my work ,COMMA in understanding art and in understanding culture ,COMMA has come by following artists ,COMMA by looking at what artists mean and what they do and who they are .PERIOD <BREAK>
My overall project is about art -- specifically ,COMMA about black artists -- very generally about the way in which art can change the way we think about culture and ourselves .PERIOD <BREAK>
What that might mean for cultural movements all over this moment ,COMMA the me ,COMMA we seems incredibly prescient totally important .PERIOD <BREAK>
To this end ,COMMA the specific project that has made this possible for me is a series of exhibitions ,COMMA all titled with an F -- Freestyle ,COMMA Frequency and Flow -- which have set out to discover and define the young ,COMMA black artists working in this moment who I feel strongly will continue to work over the next many years .PERIOD <BREAK>
It is really in this sense of discovery that I have a new set of questions that I'm asking .PERIOD <BREAK>
But ,COMMA really ,COMMA it has been what I've discovered about myself and what I can offer in the space of an exhibition ,COMMA to talk about beauty ,COMMA to talk about power ,COMMA to talk about ourselves ,COMMA and to talk and speak to each other .PERIOD <BREAK>
And you put on the T- 10 parachute .PERIOD <BREAK>
They give 20 minutes -- that's a time warning .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that's to boost everybody's confidence ,COMMA to show that you're not scared .PERIOD <BREAK>
Then they give you ,COMMA Get ready .PERIOD <BREAK>
So nice air comes flowing in .PERIOD <BREAK>
So then you look around ,COMMA you're under a canopy and you say ,COMMA This is good .PERIOD <BREAK>
In 30 -some years of jumping ,COMMA I never did one .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I realized that ,COMMA if they had to go into combat ,COMMA they would do what we had taught them and they would follow leaders .PERIOD <BREAK>
So now I do that Tuesday morning jump ,COMMA but it's not any jump -- that was September 11 th ,COMMA 2001 .PERIOD <BREAK>
Sort of leadership by humiliation .PERIOD <BREAK>
I've got to use video teleconferences ,COMMA I've got to use chat ,COMMA I've got to use email ,COMMA I've got to use phone calls -- I've got to use everything I can ,COMMA not just for communication ,COMMA but for leadership .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that's a new kind of leadership for me .PERIOD <BREAK>
So we had to get complex intelligence together ,COMMA we had to line up the ability to act .PERIOD <BREAK>
In reality ,COMMA much of the force I led looked exactly like you .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so instead of giving orders ,COMMA you're now building consensus and you're building a sense of shared purpose .PERIOD <BREAK>
It also produced something which I call an inversion of expertise ,COMMA because we had so many changes at the lower levels in technology and tactics and whatnot ,COMMA that suddenly the things that we grew up doing wasn't what the force was doing anymore .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it's a brand new leadership challenge .PERIOD <BREAK>
And every morning in the Ranger regiment ,COMMA every Ranger -- and there are more than 2000 of them -- says a six-stanza Ranger creed .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so the organizational relationship that bonds them is just amazing .PERIOD <BREAK>
That was my journey .PERIOD <BREAK>
I came to believe that a leader isn't good because they're right ;SEMICOLON they're good because they're willing to learn and to trust .PERIOD <BREAK>
Alex Steffen and I founded Worldchanging in late 2003 ,COMMA and since then we and our growing global team of contributors have documented the ever-expanding variety of solutions that are out there ,COMMA right now and on the near horizon .PERIOD <BREAK>
As Norwegian social scientist Evelin Lindner has observed ,COMMA Pessimism is a luxury of good times .PERIOD <BREAK>
In difficult times ,COMMA pessimism is a self-fulfilling ,COMMA self-inflicted death sentence .PERIOD <BREAK>
Community tools ,COMMA like text messaging ,COMMA that can tell you when pollen counts are up or smog levels are rising or a natural disaster is unfolding ,COMMA can give you the information you need to act in a timely fashion .PERIOD <BREAK>
The political aspects of mobile phones can't be ignored either ,COMMA from text message swarms in Korea helping to bring down a government ,COMMA to the Blairwatch Project in the UK ,COMMA keeping tabs on politicians who try to avoid the press .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA imagine a similar model for networking environmentalists .PERIOD <BREAK>
Imagine a Web portal collecting recordings and evidence of what's happening to the planet :COLON putting news and data at the fingertips of people of all kinds ,COMMA from activists and researchers to businesspeople and political figures .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA just to be clear ,COMMA in this talk I'm using the name Earth Witness as part of the scenario ,COMMA simply as a shorthand ,COMMA for what this imaginary project could aspire to ,COMMA not to piggyback on the wonderful work of the Witness organization .PERIOD <BREAK>
Earth Witness would show us two worlds :COLON the world we're leaving behind ,COMMA and the world we're building for generations to come .PERIOD <BREAK>
After this ,COMMA we noticed a couple of interesting things ,COMMA which you'll see .PERIOD <BREAK>
Make yourself understood to the computer .PERIOD <BREAK>
And he couldn't travel ,COMMA so I went over there .PERIOD <BREAK>
And all over India ,COMMA at the end of about two years ,COMMA children were beginning to Google their homework .PERIOD <BREAK>
They said ,COMMA Yes ,COMMA we did .PERIOD <BREAK>
So I said ,COMMA For two months ,COMMA you were looking at stuff you didn't understand ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
It took me three years to publish that .PERIOD <BREAK>
I said ,COMMA No ,COMMA use the method of the grandmother .PERIOD <BREAK>
What is that ?QUESTIONMARK Can you do that again ?QUESTIONMARK Can you show me some more' She did that for two months .PERIOD <BREAK>
The scores went up to 50 ,COMMA which is what the posh schools of New Delhi ,COMMA with a trained biotechnology teacher were getting .PERIOD <BREAK>
The first group -- the best one -- solved everything in 20 minutes .PERIOD <BREAK>
The average score when I'd done it with the computers and the groups was 76 percent .PERIOD <BREAK>
Back at Gateshead ,COMMA a 10 -year-old girl gets into the heart of Hinduism in 15 minutes .PERIOD <BREAK>
You know ,COMMA stuff which I don't know anything about .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is a SOLE in Newcastle .PERIOD <BREAK>
I started writing English questions on the blackboard .PERIOD <BREAK>
So you know what's happened ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Thanks .PERIOD <BREAK>
I was too young ,COMMA unmarried ,COMMA I had no children ,COMMA didn't really know Africa ,COMMA and besides ,COMMA my French was pitiful .PERIOD <BREAK>
So then I went the whole American way ,COMMA with competitions ,COMMA team and individual .PERIOD Completely failed ,COMMA but over time ,COMMA the women learnt to sell on their own way .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA blue ,COMMA blue ,COMMA everything became blue .PERIOD <BREAK>
I think Andrew pretty well covered that ,COMMA so I will move to the third point ,COMMA which is that markets alone also are not going to solve the problems of poverty .PERIOD <BREAK>
Both of them live at the confluence of public health and enterprise ,COMMA and both of them ,COMMA because they're manufacturers ,COMMA create jobs directly ,COMMA and create incomes indirectly ,COMMA because they're in the malaria sector ,COMMA and Africa loses about 13 billion dollars a year because of malaria .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it's really time we start thinking more creatively about how they can be fused .PERIOD <BREAK>
He was actually living in the Kibera slums when his father called him and told him about Artemisia and the value-add potential .PERIOD <BREAK>
Samuel's kids are in private school ,COMMA and he's starting to help other farmers in the area also go into Artemisia production -- dignity being more important than wealth .PERIOD <BREAK>
The next one ,COMMA many of you know .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so ,COMMA from an enterprise perspective for Africa ,COMMA and from a public health perspective ,COMMA these are real successes .PERIOD <BREAK>
We can start building local distribution ,COMMA and actually ,COMMA it can cost the public sector much less .PERIOD <BREAK>
One ,COMMA that people will pay different prices ,COMMA but the overwhelming number of people will come forth at one dollar per net and make a decision to buy it .PERIOD <BREAK>
But what it takes is a commitment from all of us to essentially refuse trite assumptions ,COMMA get out of our ideological boxes .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we came up with some parameters ,COMMA because ,COMMA you know ,COMMA building a Rube Goldberg machine has limitations ,COMMA but it also is pretty wide open .PERIOD <BREAK>
Okay ,COMMA so now the start to finish timing has to be perfect .PERIOD <BREAK>
Of those 85 takes ,COMMA only three actually successfully completed their run .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the wonderful elation that we had when we finally completed it .PERIOD <BREAK>
It think we can do better than this .PERIOD Hello TEDxUSC .PERIOD <BREAK>
Let me start again .PERIOD <BREAK>
Where it goes in the future is questioned .PERIOD So that's the human part .PERIOD <BREAK>
And in that 15 percent ,COMMA the main focus is on human mind ,COMMA thinking skills ,COMMA somehow trying to unleash kids from the straightjacket of school ,COMMA which is putting information and dogma into them ,COMMA get them so they really think ,COMMA ask tough questions ,COMMA argue about serious subjects ,COMMA don't believe everything that's in the book ,COMMA think broadly or creative .PERIOD They can be .PERIOD <BREAK>
Here's a giant flying replica of a pterosaur that has no tail .PERIOD <BREAK>
This was the full size of the original creature .PERIOD <BREAK>
It sends high-resolution video pictures back to the operator .PERIOD <BREAK>
Buckminster Fuller said it clearly :COLON there are no passengers on spaceship Earth ,COMMA only crew .PERIOD We ,COMMA the crew ,COMMA can and must do more with less -- much less .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's amazing :COLON just on the puny power of the sun -- by having a super lightweight plane ,COMMA you're able to get it up there .PERIOD <BREAK>
We couldn't bring one here to fly it and show you .PERIOD <BREAK>
But there's a lot of technology going .PERIOD <BREAK>
Sorry .PERIOD <BREAK>
It never makes a mistake .PERIOD Because if you make a mistake ,COMMA you don't leave any progeny .PERIOD <BREAK>
In concluding ,COMMA I want to get back to the big picture and I have just two final slides to try and put it in perspective .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so I just put robotic and natural cockroaches out there ,COMMA but you can fill in whatever you want .PERIOD This is not a forecast .PERIOD <BREAK>
Last night we gave it a few too many turns and it tried to bash the roof out also .PERIOD It's about a gram .PERIOD <BREAK>
Thank you .PERIOD <BREAK>
And despite their ferocious appearance ,COMMA Tasmanian devils are actually quite adorable little animals .PERIOD <BREAK>
But inevitably ,COMMA these tumors progress towards being enormous ,COMMA ulcerating tumors like this one here .PERIOD <BREAK>
They were too young to survive without their mother .PERIOD <BREAK>
Scientists around the world were intrigued by this cancer ,COMMA this infectious cancer ,COMMA that was spreading through the Tasmanian devil population .PERIOD <BREAK>
I myself had a tumor removed from my large intestine when I was only 14 .PERIOD <BREAK>
Paradoxically ,COMMA once established ,COMMA natural selection actually favors the continued growth of cancer .PERIOD <BREAK>
So cancer could be thought of as a strange ,COMMA short-lived ,COMMA self-destructive life form -- an evolutionary dead end .PERIOD <BREAK>
In fact ,COMMA more genetic profiling told us that this tumor in Jonas actually probably first arose from the cells of a female Tasmanian devil -- and Jonas was clearly a male .PERIOD <BREAK>
So how come a tumor that arose from the cells of another individual is growing on Jonas' face ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Well the next breakthrough came from studying hundreds of Tasmanian devil cancers from all around Tasmania .PERIOD <BREAK>
They tend to bite each other ,COMMA often quite ferociously and usually on the face .PERIOD <BREAK>
But if this can happen in Tasmanian devils ,COMMA why hasn't it happened in other animals or even humans ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Well the answer is ,COMMA it has .PERIOD <BREAK>
She took him to the vet and the vet discovered something quite disgusting .PERIOD <BREAK>
So we've seen that this can happen in animals .PERIOD <BREAK>
Ad he decided to put this to the test by actually deliberately inoculating people with cancer from somebody else .PERIOD <BREAK>
Most of the people that Dr .PERIOD Southam injected did not go on to develop cancer from the injected cells .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I think that this is something that oncologists and epidemiologists should be aware of in the future .PERIOD <BREAK>
Why has the record been so poor ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Because after years of stagnation and decline ,COMMA the mentality of politics is that it's a zero-sum game .PERIOD <BREAK>
The Security Council typically has the responsibility for providing the peacekeepers who build the security .PERIOD <BREAK>
It does increase security .PERIOD <BREAK>
One is jobs .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA that is difficult .PERIOD <BREAK>
So we need to encourage the growth of local firms .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it's schizophrenic because in their hearts donors know that's not a realistic agenda ,COMMA and so what they also do is the total bypass :COLON just fund NGOs .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's to split the functions of a monopoly line ministry up into three .PERIOD <BREAK>
So they wouldn't be provided thanks to the United States government and some NGO .PERIOD <BREAK>
And basically ,COMMA what I'd like to tell you is that power is changing ,COMMA and there are two types of changes I want to discuss .PERIOD <BREAK>
What we're going to see in the 21 st century is Asia gradually returning to being more than half of the world's population and more than half of the world's product .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's not just prevailing at war ,COMMA though war still persists .PERIOD <BREAK>
If we try to focus on the reality ,COMMA then what we need to focus on is what's really happening in terms of China and the United States .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that the Chinese won't catch up or pass the Americans until somewhere in the latter part ,COMMA after 2050 ,COMMA of this century .PERIOD <BREAK>
Why does it matter ?QUESTIONMARK Who cares ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
The answer is it matters quite a lot .PERIOD <BREAK>
So empowering China to deal with its own problems of carbon is good for everybody ,COMMA and it's not a zero sum ,COMMA I win ,COMMA you lose .PERIOD <BREAK>
How do we define our national interests so that it's not just zero sum ,COMMA but positive sum .PERIOD <BREAK>
The world has a new mania .PERIOD <BREAK>
A mania for learning English .PERIOD <BREAK>
T :COLON I don't want to let myself down .PERIOD <BREAK>
T :COLON Perfect !EXCLAMATIONMARK S :COLON Perfect !EXCLAMATIONMARK <BREAK>
S :COLON I want to change my life !EXCLAMATIONMARK <BREAK>
So is English mania good or bad ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And now English is becoming the language of problem-solving .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's a true feeling .PERIOD <BREAK>
Why is this old table in your office ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And as I grew up ,COMMA I heard so much knowledge and so many insights and so much wisdom come out around this table ,COMMA I began to call it the wisdom table .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I was so shocked ,COMMA so stunned ,COMMA I got up and said ,COMMA Well ,COMMA thank you ,COMMA but what do I do ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And that question cleared the space .PERIOD <BREAK>
This film is called World Peace and Other 4 th Grade Achievements .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it's a beautiful thing .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I saw Miss Ethel J .PERIOD Banks who wore pearls and high-heels to elementary school every day .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I'm not even talking about you behind me ,COMMA because I've got eyes in the back of my head .PERIOD <BREAK>
And really ,COMMA I feel as though ,COMMA when I see the film -- I have a gesture she does ,COMMA like this -- I feel like I am a continuation of her gesture .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so this World Peace Game I'd like to tell you about .PERIOD <BREAK>
I didn't want to lecture or have just book reading .PERIOD <BREAK>
I offer them the job ,COMMA they can turn it down ,COMMA and then they choose their own cabinet .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's not all .PERIOD <BREAK>
I throw them into this complex matrix ,COMMA and they trust me because we have a deep ,COMMA rich relationship together .PERIOD <BREAK>
There's oil spills ,COMMA environmental disasters ,COMMA water rights disputes ,COMMA breakaway republics ,COMMA famine ,COMMA endangered species and global warming .PERIOD <BREAK>
I have no chance to make any policy whatsoever once they start playing .PERIOD <BREAK>
And because I don't know ,COMMA they've got to dig up the answer .PERIOD <BREAK>
My question to you is ,COMMA who's in charge of that classroom ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And we were very upset .PERIOD <BREAK>
I could not have designed that in teaching it .PERIOD <BREAK>
It'll be more realer if she reads it .PERIOD <BREAK>
We have a lot of data ,COMMA but I think sometimes we go beyond data with the real truth of what's going on .PERIOD <BREAK>
And there are three seconds left on the clock .PERIOD <BREAK>
I joined Telco ,COMMA made TATA trucks ,COMMA pretty close to Pune .PERIOD <BREAK>
So I took one year off ,COMMA and I went to this village science program .PERIOD <BREAK>
This square might look very square and prim .PERIOD <BREAK>
But give a child a triangle ,COMMA he can't do a thing to it .PERIOD <BREAK>
They always make a triangular roof .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now this is people science .PERIOD <BREAK>
The insects are eaten by the frogs ;SEMICOLON the frogs are eaten by the snakes ;SEMICOLON the snakes are eaten by the eagles .PERIOD <BREAK>
And you put a little fan here .PERIOD <BREAK>
And this is a hundred-year-old toy .PERIOD <BREAK>
I just put this inside this .PERIOD <BREAK>
The most expensive thing is the battery inside this .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is an old bicycle tube ,COMMA which gives you a broad rubber band ,COMMA two safety pins .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's the interaction of both these magnets which makes this motor spin .PERIOD <BREAK>
There are six layers -- three layers of plastic ,COMMA aluminum -- which are are sealed together .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'm going to keep this outside ,COMMA to blow out .PERIOD I'm going to suck in air .PERIOD <BREAK>
Well before I go any further ,COMMA this is something worth sharing .PERIOD <BREAK>
If I crank the handle ,COMMA all the wool goes inside .PERIOD <BREAK>
There are 12 million blind children in our country -- who live in a world of darkness .PERIOD <BREAK>
When first you see Nehru and Gandhi ,COMMA this is the Nehru cap -- just half a newspaper .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the second night ,COMMA he would take the same cap and give it another fold .PERIOD <BREAK>
And there's a third one over here .PERIOD <BREAK>
Firstly ,COMMA radical increases in resource efficiency .PERIOD <BREAK>
And for all three of these ,COMMA I believe ,COMMA biomimicry has a lot of the solutions that we're going to need .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I'm just going to talk through this animation .PERIOD <BREAK>
And just as natural systems tend to increase in diversity and resilience over time ,COMMA there's a real sense with this project that the number of possibilities just continue increasing .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the kind of elements I'm talking about are ,COMMA firstly ,COMMA we have a restaurant inside a productive greenhouse ,COMMA a bit like this one in Amsterdam called De Kas .PERIOD <BREAK>
So for instance ,COMMA when Julius Caesar arrived in North Africa ,COMMA huge areas of North Africa were covered in cedar and cypress forests .PERIOD <BREAK>
The converse is also true .PERIOD <BREAK>
The more vegetation we lose ,COMMA the more that's likely to exacerbate climate change and lead to further desertification .PERIOD <BREAK>
The way it does this is it comes out at night ,COMMA crawls to the top of a sand dune ,COMMA and because it's got a matte black shell ,COMMA is able to radiate heat out to the night sky and become slightly cooler than its surroundings .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the ingenuity ,COMMA if you could call it that ,COMMA goes even further .PERIOD <BREAK>
Between them there's a waxy finish which repels water .PERIOD <BREAK>
We're working with the guy who invented the Seawater Greenhouse .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is a greenhouse designed for arid coastal regions ,COMMA and the way it works is that you have this whole wall of evaporator grills ,COMMA and you trickle seawater over that so that wind blows through ,COMMA it picks up a lot of moisture and is cooled in the process .PERIOD <BREAK>
And what they found with the first Seawater Greenhouse that was built was it was producing slightly more freshwater than it needed for the plants inside .PERIOD <BREAK>
And when you think about nature ,COMMA often you think about it as being all about competition .PERIOD <BREAK>
You think ,COMMA What can I add to the system to create more value ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And it turns out that different things crystallize out at different stages .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now we would be able to make use of all that waste brine .PERIOD <BREAK>
We could evaporate it to enhance the restorative benefits and capture the salts ,COMMA transforming an urgent waste problem into a big opportunity .PERIOD <BREAK>
Far too much of the talk about the environment uses very negative language .PERIOD <BREAK>
And this is an important point .PERIOD <BREAK>
There are very few doctors and ,COMMA quite frankly ,COMMA these countries do not have the resources that are needed to cope with such epidemics .PERIOD <BREAK>
Very simple .PERIOD <BREAK>
And knowing that starts to explain a lot of long-standing mysteries in science .PERIOD <BREAK>
It also brings up new issues ,COMMA though ,COMMA like computational irreducibility .PERIOD <BREAK>
You know ,COMMA in working on this science for many years ,COMMA I kept wondering ,COMMA What will be its first killer app ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Let's start off with something really easy .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it should be able to tell us that .PERIOD <BREAK>
let's say the revenue of Microsoft .PERIOD <BREAK>
Well ,COMMA even starting from Mathematica ,COMMA this is still a huge amount of work .PERIOD <BREAK>
Well ,COMMA a crucial idea of Wolfram Alpha is that you can just ask it questions using ordinary human language ,COMMA which means that we've got to be able to take all those strange utterances that people type into the input field and understand them .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I must say that I thought that step might just be plain impossible .PERIOD <BREAK>
Right now ,COMMA if we look at web queries ,COMMA more than 80 percent of them get handled successfully the first time .PERIOD <BREAK>
And when one does that ,COMMA one really changes the economics of delivering computational things ,COMMA whether it's on the web or elsewhere .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'll show you one example here .PERIOD <BREAK>
Something like Rule 30 ,COMMA for example ,COMMA turns out to be a really good randomness generator .PERIOD <BREAK>
So could that be what's going on with our whole universe ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
But in at least a large class of cases ,COMMA one can think of the universe as being like some kind of network ,COMMA which ,COMMA when it gets big enough ,COMMA behaves like continuous space in much the same way as having lots of molecules can behave like a continuous fluid .PERIOD <BREAK>
Actually ,COMMA I haven't shown these before ,COMMA but here are a few of the candidate universes that I've looked at .PERIOD <BREAK>
Benoit Mandelbrot is in the audience .PERIOD <BREAK>
We've questioned the future of capitalism .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the idea is a simple ,COMMA simple idea ,COMMA which is the fact that the consumer has moved from a state of anxiety to action .PERIOD <BREAK>
The consumer is empowered .PERIOD <BREAK>
Do you know what this was right here ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And what you end up seeing is the whole phenomenon of the fact that we are actually stepping forth and basically leveraging future education ,COMMA future children in our households .PERIOD <BREAK>
However ,COMMA consumers have moved .PERIOD <BREAK>
Dentists report molars ,COMMA you know ,COMMA people grinding their teeth ,COMMA coming in and reporting the fact that they've had stress .PERIOD <BREAK>
But seriously ,COMMA what we see happening ,COMMA and the reason I want to stress that the consumer is not in retreat ,COMMA is that this is a tremendous opportunity for the consumer who drove us into this recession to lead us right back out .PERIOD <BREAK>
We see high-end haggling in fashion today .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA from a value and values standpoint ,COMMA what companies can do is connect in lots of different ways .PERIOD <BREAK>
Gore-Tex is all about personal accountability of their management and their employees ,COMMA to the point where they really kind of shun the idea of bosses .PERIOD <BREAK>
The third of the four laws of post-crisis consumerism is about durable living .PERIOD <BREAK>
I was fascinated to learn that 30 percent of all homes in America are actually built by owners .PERIOD <BREAK>
Let's look at a couple of quick examples .PERIOD <BREAK>
You need to harness it .PERIOD You need to give it meaning .PERIOD <BREAK>
This Kogi doesn't exist .PERIOD It's a moving truck .PERIOD Right ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Or you look at Johnson &amp ;SEMICOLON Johnson's Momversations .PERIOD <BREAK>
You see this rising force in sort of total transparency and openness that companies are starting to adopt ,COMMA all because the consumer is demanding it .PERIOD <BREAK>
But ,COMMA at the same time ,COMMA this is also a tremendous opportunity .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA I decided to investigate .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA I'm going to challenge all of you .PERIOD <BREAK>
We talk about world peace .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I want to thank all of you in the audience for being great husbands ,COMMA great mothers ,COMMA friends ,COMMA daughters ,COMMA sons .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's what I do in life -- telling stories ,COMMA writing novels -- and today I would like to tell you a few stories about the art of storytelling and also some supernatural creatures called the djinni .PERIOD <BREAK>
I was born in Strasbourg ,COMMA France to Turkish parents .PERIOD <BREAK>
In response she said ,COMMA Yes ,COMMA praying is effective ,COMMA but also beware of the power of circles .PERIOD <BREAK>
We all do .PERIOD <BREAK>
Our friends ,COMMA neighbors ,COMMA colleagues ,COMMA family -- if all the people in our inner circle resemble us ,COMMA it means we are surrounded with our mirror image .PERIOD <BREAK>
Instead ,COMMA it generated an atmosphere in which each child was seen -- not as an individual on his own ,COMMA but as the representative of something larger .PERIOD <BREAK>
I came to learn that these were the three main stereotypes about my country :COLON politics ,COMMA cigarettes and the veil .PERIOD <BREAK>
I lived in a very vibrant ,COMMA diverse neighborhood where I wrote several of my novels .PERIOD <BREAK>
What I experienced as a child in that school in Madrid is happening in the literary world today .PERIOD <BREAK>
Meanwhile ,COMMA the other leg draws a wide circle ,COMMA constantly moving .PERIOD <BREAK>
We see them as the domain of supernatural creatures like the djinn ,COMMA who are made of smokeless fire and are the symbol of elusiveness .PERIOD <BREAK>
Perhaps that's not the right way to start at all .PERIOD <BREAK>
You see there ,COMMA it's about 620 billion a year .PERIOD <BREAK>
R&ampD in total in the economy ,COMMA publicly funded ,COMMA is about 06 percent of GDP .PERIOD <BREAK>
The first thing I want to say ,COMMA and this is straight from Wonders of the Solar System ,COMMA is that our exploration of the solar system and the universe has shown us that it is indescribably beautiful .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA tiny moon .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's fascinating and beautiful in itself ,COMMA but we think that the mechanism for powering those fountains requires there to be lakes of liquid water beneath the surface of this moon .PERIOD <BREAK>
And what's important about that is that ,COMMA on our planet ,COMMA on Earth ,COMMA wherever we find liquid water ,COMMA we find life .PERIOD <BREAK>
Tremendous and beautiful discovery .PERIOD <BREAK>
And they saw strange pictures like this .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's called helios -- helios from the Sun .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's a Type Ia supernova explosion .PERIOD <BREAK>
It sits there about ,COMMA say ,COMMA 13 times the mass of the Sun .PERIOD <BREAK>
I think that's a remarkable demonstration of the power and beauty and universality of the laws of physics ,COMMA because we understand that process ,COMMA because we understand the structure of atoms here on Earth .PERIOD <BREAK>
And if I blow it up there ,COMMA you see it .PERIOD <BREAK>
But it visited Jupiter ,COMMA Saturn ,COMMA Uranus and Neptune .PERIOD <BREAK>
You could have made it in the 1890 s ;SEMICOLON you wouldn't have the transistor .PERIOD <BREAK>
Let me leave the last words to someone who's rapidly becoming a hero of mine ,COMMA Humphrey Davy ,COMMA who did his science at the turn of the 19 th century .PERIOD <BREAK>
Thank you .PERIOD <BREAK>
Streets have names ;SEMICOLON blocks are just the unnamed spaces in between streets .PERIOD <BREAK>
They say ,COMMA Oh ,COMMA well that's Block 17 and this is Block 16 .PERIOD <BREAK>
Just look at Google Maps here .PERIOD There's Block 14 ,COMMA 15 ,COMMA 16 ,COMMA 17 ,COMMA 18 ,COMMA 19 .PERIOD <BREAK>
You say ,COMMA OK ,COMMA but walking around the neighborhood ,COMMA I noticed that the house numbers don't go in order .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's a phenomenon on the Internet today called behavioral tracking ,COMMA and it is very big business .PERIOD <BREAK>
Our daughter then joined us at the breakfast table ,COMMA and I asked her ,COMMA Is there an emphasis on music literacy in your school ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
I go to work ,COMMA I check email ,COMMA I log onto a few more social sites ,COMMA I blog ,COMMA I check more news reports ,COMMA I share some of those news reports ,COMMA I go look at some videos ,COMMA pretty typical day -- in this case ,COMMA actually fairly pedantic -- and at the end of the day ,COMMA as my day winds down ,COMMA look at my profile .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I’d say ,COMMA Well ,COMMA I’m walking for the environment .PERIOD <BREAK>
I called my parents up .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so I did .PERIOD <BREAK>
It’s only 500 miles .PERIOD <BREAK>
I had written the University of Montana two years earlier and said I'd like to go to school there .PERIOD <BREAK>
But I use that story because they really wanted to help me .PERIOD <BREAK>
I had 13 students when I first walked into the class .PERIOD <BREAK>
I could see they were looking for the schedule ,COMMA to see when they could get out .PERIOD <BREAK>
They had to take that class with me .PERIOD <BREAK>
And on Earth Day ,COMMA 1990 -- the 20 th anniversary of Earth Day -- that’s when I began to speak .PERIOD <BREAK>
I got on a sailboat and I sailed down to the Caribbean ,COMMA and walked through all of the islands ,COMMA and to Venezuela .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I got to -- I start saying ,COMMA Free at last -- thank God Almighty ,COMMA I’m free at last .PERIOD <BREAK>
I had no idea I was going to become a UN .PERIOD Ambassador .PERIOD <BREAK>
I was going to have to change .PERIOD <BREAK>
I know I needed to change ,COMMA because it would be the only way that I could be here today .PERIOD <BREAK>
When does learning begin ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Well today I want to present to you an idea that may be surprising and may even seem implausible ,COMMA but which is supported by the latest evidence from psychology and biology .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now I'm a science reporter .PERIOD <BREAK>
I write books and magazine articles .PERIOD <BREAK>
The flavors of the food a pregnant woman eats find their way into the amniotic fluid ,COMMA which is continuously swallowed by the fetus .PERIOD <BREAK>
What this means is that fetuses are effectively being taught by their mothers about what is safe and good to eat .PERIOD <BREAK>
The pregnant woman's diet and stress level in particular provide important clues to prevailing conditions like a finger lifted to the wind .PERIOD <BREAK>
The Hunger Winter ,COMMA as it came to be known ,COMMA killed some 10000 people and weakened thousands more .PERIOD <BREAK>
Learning is one of life's most essential activities ,COMMA and it begins much earlier than we ever imagined .PERIOD <BREAK>
You'd still have five billion left in change ,COMMA and people would ask for the trains to be slowed down .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA years after you remember the strategic question of whether you're flying in a 777 or an Airbus ,COMMA you remember those words and that experience .PERIOD <BREAK>
I mean ,COMMA it could almost be rather like that scene from the film Airplane .PERIOD <BREAK>
I spoke about this before ,COMMA and a brilliant person got in touch with me and said ,COMMA Okay ,COMMA what can you do ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
One of them also being ,COMMA although logically it's quite a good idea to have a lift with no up and down button in it ,COMMA if it only serves two floors ,COMMA it's actually bloody terrifying ,COMMA okay ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
They said ,COMMA Can we do an advertising campaign ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
I said ,COMMA It's really ,COMMA really easy .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA interesting that no single person does that ,COMMA or at least can admit to being so anal as to do it .PERIOD <BREAK>
Moving over ,COMMA we come ,COMMA of course ,COMMA to consultancy .PERIOD <BREAK>
I mean ,COMMA Tiger surely was actually obeying the Accenture model .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's why I call for the Chief Detail Officer .PERIOD <BREAK>
But as I was moving away from the traditional classical repertoire and trying to find new ways of musical expression ,COMMA I realized that with today's technological resources ,COMMA there's no reason to limit what can be produced at one time from a single string instrument .PERIOD <BREAK>
But what actually interests me a lot more is the fact that in the tip of each controller is a relatively high-performing infrared camera .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I also was taught ,COMMA coupled with that ,COMMA that it was my job -- this classroom full of five and six year-old children -- it was our job ,COMMA apparently ,COMMA to help .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is what Jesus asked of us .PERIOD <BREAK>
That was news to me ,COMMA and it felt like it was a very important thing to get to participate in .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I felt overwhelmed .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I didn't know what would happen when I ran out of things to give ,COMMA especially if the problem was never going away .PERIOD <BREAK>
I heard about things that were going wrong in the lives of the poor .PERIOD <BREAK>
I started to feel guilty for my own relative wealth ,COMMA because I wasn't doing more ,COMMA apparently ,COMMA to make things better .PERIOD <BREAK>
It became a transaction for me ,COMMA became sort of a trade .PERIOD <BREAK>
So I spent three months in Kenya ,COMMA Uganda and Tanzania interviewing entrepreneurs that had received 100 dollars to start or grow a business .PERIOD <BREAK>
I was starting to be friends and get to know their personal stories .PERIOD <BREAK>
But there were these beautiful details ,COMMA even if I talked to 20 goat herders in a row ,COMMA and some days that's what happened -- these beautiful details of life change that were meaningful to them .PERIOD <BREAK>
I never once was asked for a donation ,COMMA which had kind of been my mode ,COMMA right .PERIOD <BREAK>
We sent it over to Uganda .PERIOD <BREAK>
When you lend them money ,COMMA and they slowly pay you back over time ,COMMA you have this excuse to have an ongoing dialogue .PERIOD <BREAK>
So the mapping of participating in the story ,COMMA it actually flows with the up and down .PERIOD <BREAK>
We make it really ,COMMA really simple for me as well as anyone else who wants to use the site .PERIOD <BREAK>
But the good news is I don't think I need to stand here and convince you to care -- I'm not even going to try .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I'm grateful that whenever I do that ,COMMA guaranteed ,COMMA I am inspired -- I am inspired by the person I am listening to .PERIOD <BREAK>
What is the future of the human race ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
If not ,COMMA what created the universe ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
First ,COMMA there were the laws like Maxwell's equations and general relativity that determined the evolution of the universe ,COMMA given its state over all of space at one time .PERIOD <BREAK>
However ,COMMA this division into laws of evolution and initial conditions depends on time and space being separate and distinct .PERIOD <BREAK>
Indeed ,COMMA it has probably given me more time than most people to pursue the quest for knowledge .PERIOD <BREAK>
Professor Hawking ,COMMA thank you for that answer .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'm a geologist by training .PERIOD But I love that .PERIOD <BREAK>
Here we're going to see one backing into a crevice ,COMMA and watch his tentacles -- he just pulls them in ,COMMA makes them look just like algae .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's an amazing thing .PERIOD <BREAK>
and an octopus .PERIOD Ain't that amazing ?QUESTIONMARK Now ,COMMA Roger spooked him so he took off in a cloud of ink ,COMMA and when he lands the octopus says ,COMMA Oh ,COMMA I've been seen .PERIOD <BREAK>
And now he's gone ,COMMA and so am I .PERIOD Thank you very much .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's the Lucy species ,COMMA and was found by my research team in December of 2000 in an area called Dikika .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's in the northeastern part of Ethiopia .PERIOD <BREAK>
You don't just jump into an invitation .PERIOD <BREAK>
First entertainment comes evidence from flutes that are 35000 years old .PERIOD <BREAK>
When you get there ,COMMA this is what you see ,COMMA and it's the vastness of the place which makes you feel helpless and vulnerable .PERIOD <BREAK>
You find elephants ,COMMA rhinos ,COMMA monkeys ,COMMA pigs ,COMMA etc .PERIOD <BREAK>
Again ,COMMA another one ,COMMA That's a monkey .PERIOD That's a pig ,COMMA etc .PERIOD <BREAK>
Here is a close-up of the fossil ,COMMA after five years of cleaning ,COMMA preparation and description ,COMMA which was very long ,COMMA and I had to expose the bones from the sandstone block I just showed you in the previous slide .PERIOD <BREAK>
So then ,COMMA once you've done that ,COMMA the next stage is to know what it is .PERIOD <BREAK>
You don't see that in chimpanzees ,COMMA and you don't see this very projecting canine .PERIOD <BREAK>
And how old was she when she died ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
That's why we need care from our parents .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA by being at the cusp of our evolutionary history ,COMMA Selam unites us all and gives us a unique account on what makes us human .PERIOD <BREAK>
Up to now ,COMMA the knowledge that we had about our ancestors came essentially from adult individuals because the fossils ,COMMA the baby fossils ,COMMA were missing .PERIOD <BREAK>
Imagine somebody coming from Mars and his job is to report on the type of people occupying our planet Earth ,COMMA and you hide all the babies ,COMMA the children ,COMMA and he goes back and reports .PERIOD <BREAK>
And they were probably not aware of this future legacy ,COMMA but they did great .PERIOD <BREAK>
With an average depth of the oceans of 4000 meters ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA the high seas covers and provides nearly 90 percent of the habitat for life on this Earth .PERIOD <BREAK>
It is ,COMMA in theory ,COMMA the global commons ,COMMA belonging to us all .PERIOD <BREAK>
So here is a picture of the high seas as seen from above -- that area in the darker blue .PERIOD <BREAK>
And of course ,COMMA if you want people to play by the rules ,COMMA you still need an effective system of monitoring and enforcement ,COMMA for as we've discovered ,COMMA you can trust ,COMMA but you also need to verify .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's also known as the spawning ground for eels from Northern European and Northern American rivers that are now so dwindling in numbers that they've actually stopped showing up in Stockholm ,COMMA and five showed up in the UK .PERIOD just recently .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's actually a bay .PERIOD <BREAK>
Coming closer to here ,COMMA the Costa Rica Dome is a recently discovered area -- potentially year-round habitat for blue whales .PERIOD <BREAK>
That is ,COMMA it provides a wonderful example of where you can go with a real regional initiative .PERIOD <BREAK>
So what we've been suggesting is that we either need to amend the World Heritage Convention ,COMMA so that it can adopt and urge universal protection of these World Heritage sites ,COMMA or we need to change the name and call it Half-the-World Heritage Convention .PERIOD <BREAK>
What I find so exciting is that the Census of Marine Life has looked at more than the tagging of pacific predators ;SEMICOLON it's also looked in the really unexplored mid-water column ,COMMA where creatures like this flying sea cucumber have been found .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the exciting thing is that we do have sufficient information to move ahead to protect some of these significant hope spots ,COMMA hotspots .PERIOD <BREAK>
But not all the vessels have those to date .PERIOD <BREAK>
We need to get the new paradigm of precaution and respect .PERIOD <BREAK>
So here we are ,COMMA seven years ,COMMA 500 interviews later ,COMMA and I'm gonna tell you what really leads to success and makes TED-sters tick .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the first thing I say to them is :COLON OK ,COMMA well you can't serve yourself ;SEMICOLON you gotta serve others something of value .PERIOD <BREAK>
While that might be a somewhat morbid thought ,COMMA I think it has some really profound implications that are worth exploring .PERIOD <BREAK>
But today we're all creating this incredibly rich digital archive that's going to live in the cloud indefinitely ,COMMA years after we're gone .PERIOD <BREAK>
And what this lets you do is create an online tribute to your loved ones ,COMMA complete with photos and videos and stories that they can post after you die .PERIOD <BREAK>
But what I think comes next is far more interesting .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now we're already starting to see some experiments here .PERIOD <BREAK>
Taking it a step further ,COMMA MIT's media lab is working on robots that can interact more like humans .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's not that it's not possible to feed ,COMMA clothe and house us all and have us live decent lives .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that's what will happen to us .PERIOD <BREAK>
I accept where we are .PERIOD <BREAK>
The future is inherently uncertain .PERIOD <BREAK>
Imagine our highly-tuned ,COMMA just-in-time food industry and our highly-stressed agricultural system failing and supermarket shelves emptying .PERIOD <BREAK>
If we feel it now and think it through ,COMMA we will realize we have nothing to fear but fear itself .PERIOD <BREAK>
We can do this .PERIOD <BREAK>
I know the free market fundamentalists will tell you that more growth ,COMMA more stuff and nine billion people going shopping is the best we can do .PERIOD <BREAK>
We have achieved remarkable things since working out how to grow food some 10000 years ago .PERIOD <BREAK>
We've built a powerful foundation of science ,COMMA knowledge and technology -- more than enough to build a society where nine billion people can lead decent ,COMMA meaningful and satisfying lives .PERIOD <BREAK>
We can choose this moment of crisis to ask and answer the big questions of society's evolution -- like ,COMMA what do we want to be when we grow up ,COMMA when we move past this bumbling adolescence where we think there are no limits and suffer delusions of immortality ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
We can choose life over fear .PERIOD <BREAK>
And one more thing :COLON Archie was suffering from this illness himself .PERIOD <BREAK>
So the situation seemed pretty desperate .PERIOD <BREAK>
He gives half of them vitamin B 12 .PERIOD <BREAK>
So Cochrane then goes to the Germans who are running the prison camp .PERIOD <BREAK>
And he can't understand how this barbarism can be tolerated ,COMMA and he vents his frustrations .PERIOD <BREAK>
So the symptoms of the complex are ,COMMA no matter how complicated the problem ,COMMA you have an absolutely overwhelming belief that you are infallibly right in your solution .PERIOD <BREAK>
You could count them in five minutes .PERIOD <BREAK>
What is evolution ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
How do you do it ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
It falls to the floor .PERIOD <BREAK>
You make lots of money .PERIOD <BREAK>
Ten percent of Americans don't disappear every year .PERIOD <BREAK>
I sometimes wonder .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now I've been sort of banging on about this for the last couple of months ,COMMA and people sometimes say to me ,COMMA Well Tim ,COMMA it's kind of obvious .PERIOD <BREAK>
And there's an authority figure in the corner behind the teacher's desk who knows all the answers .PERIOD <BREAK>
When schools stop doing that all the time ,COMMA I will admit that ,COMMA yes ,COMMA it's obvious that trial and error is a good thing .PERIOD <BREAK>
Until then ,COMMA until then I'm going to keep banging on about trial and error and why we should abandon the God complex .PERIOD <BREAK>
They had the God complex in spades .PERIOD <BREAK>
And after the trial had been running for a little while ,COMMA he gathered together all his colleagues around his table ,COMMA and he said ,COMMA Well ,COMMA gentlemen ,COMMA we have some preliminary results .PERIOD <BREAK>
Shut it down at once .PERIOD <BREAK>
Tumbleweed rolls through the meeting room .PERIOD <BREAK>
It isn't easy .PERIOD <BREAK>
So shortly after the war ,COMMA this young man ,COMMA Yutaka Taniyama ,COMMA developed this amazing conjecture called the Taniyama-Shimura Conjecture .PERIOD <BREAK>
In fact ,COMMA it turns out it's equivalent to proving Fermat's Last Theorem .PERIOD <BREAK>
You prove one ,COMMA you prove the other .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the problem with leverage is it makes the US .PERIOD financial system look like this .PERIOD <BREAK>
That means every bad loan goes bad 47 times over .PERIOD <BREAK>
And as you think about that ,COMMA you've got to wonder :COLON so what do banks have in store for you now ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Except we've been so busy giving away a trillion here ,COMMA a trillion there ,COMMA that we've brought that date of reckoning forward to about 2017 .PERIOD <BREAK>
We're going to start to pay them .PERIOD <BREAK>
This guy runs the China Investment Corporation .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is an actual bill .PERIOD <BREAK>
If you look at the federal budget ,COMMA this is what it looks like .PERIOD <BREAK>
Everything else is mandated .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's the short term .PERIOD That's the flame part .PERIOD <BREAK>
Among other things ,COMMA because startup companies are .PERIOD 02 percent of US .PERIOD GDP investmentm and they're about 178 percent of output .PERIOD <BREAK>
Twenty-one countries came together .PERIOD Dozens of teams .PERIOD <BREAK>
Two years ago ,COMMA you saw this creature .PERIOD <BREAK>
But then if you lose one of those second set of teeth ,COMMA they don't regrow ,COMMA unless ,COMMA if you're a lawyer .PERIOD <BREAK>
So there are now nine women walking around Boston with re-grown bladders ,COMMA which is much more pleasant than walking around with a whole bunch of plastic bags for the rest of your life .PERIOD <BREAK>
If you don't have a flat world ,COMMA that's not good ,COMMA which is why the robot's we're designing today are a little different .PERIOD <BREAK>
And this stuff is moving very quickly ,COMMA and by the way ,COMMA that thing can carry about 350 pounds of weight .PERIOD <BREAK>
And about two or three years after they can hear as well as you and I can ,COMMA they'll be able to hear maybe how bats sing ,COMMA or how whales talk ,COMMA or how dogs talk ,COMMA and other types of tonal scales .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is a group in Germany that's beginning to engineer eyes so that people who are blind can begin to see light and dark .PERIOD <BREAK>
Very primitive .PERIOD <BREAK>
They'll do stuff you and I can't do .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it's the 150 th anniversary of the publication of The Origin of Species .PERIOD <BREAK>
Maybe not .PERIOD <BREAK>
Once upon a time ,COMMA there was a dread disease that afflicted children .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so ,COMMA as a consequence ,COMMA a few years later ,COMMA another scientist -- perhaps maybe this scientist not quite as brilliant as the one who had preceded him ,COMMA but building on the invention of the first one -- came up with a second cure .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the beauty of the second cure for this disease was that it could be used on infants and one-year-olds .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the government ,COMMA they heard her story and the other people ,COMMA and they said ,COMMA Yeah ,COMMA you're right ,COMMA we should make a law .PERIOD <BREAK>
We would lose all of our market .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA many times when you try to do research on data ,COMMA it records complicated stories -- it's hard to find in the data .PERIOD <BREAK>
And then finally ,COMMA the last set of bars ,COMMA which are really controlling for everything you could possibly imagine about the crash ,COMMA 50 ,COMMA 75 ,COMMA 100 different characteristics of the crash .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the other thing you might argue is ,COMMA Well ,COMMA car seats have got a lot better over time .PERIOD <BREAK>
So they just have these bench seats ,COMMA and they strap the car seat and the seatbelt onto it .PERIOD <BREAK>
Anyway ,COMMA it turns out that those two crashes ,COMMA that actually the three-year-old did slightly worse .PERIOD So ,COMMA he gets about a 500 out of -- you know ,COMMA on this range -- relative to a 400 and something .PERIOD <BREAK>
And this seatbelt would have passed with flying colors into being approved as a car seat .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's in 5000 days ,COMMA all this stuff has come .PERIOD <BREAK>
There's two million emails per second .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's just a huge machine ,COMMA and it uses five percent of the global electricity on the planet .PERIOD <BREAK>
And in some ways ,COMMA it's sort of back to the kind of old idea of centralized computing .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I am suggesting that every bit will be owned by the Web .PERIOD <BREAK>
They're going to talk to the machine .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA with RFIDs and other things -- whatever technology it is ,COMMA it doesn't really matter .PERIOD The point is that everything will have embedded in it some sensor connecting it to the machine ,COMMA and so we have ,COMMA basically ,COMMA an Internet of things .PERIOD <BREAK>
But in fact ,COMMA what the new economy really is is the marriage of those two ,COMMA where we embed the information ,COMMA and the digital nature of things into the material world .PERIOD <BREAK>
Attention is the currency .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I'm saying ,COMMA Humans are now going to be the extended senses of the machine ,COMMA in a certain sense .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA the second thing that I want to talk about was this idea of restructuring ,COMMA that what the Web is doing is restructuring .PERIOD <BREAK>
And what you had to do was -- if you wanted to participate in this ,COMMA you had to share packets of information .PERIOD <BREAK>
It wasn't like a telephone system where you had control of a line :COLON you had to share packets .PERIOD <BREAK>
The second stage that we're in now is the idea of linking pages .PERIOD <BREAK>
You couldn't deny -- if someone wanted to link to you ,COMMA you couldn't stop them .PERIOD You had to participate in this idea of opening up your pages to be linked by anybody .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA the last thing I want to talk about is this idea that we're going to be codependent .PERIOD <BREAK>
And what is happening with this is some kind of AI ,COMMA but it's not the AI in conscious AI ,COMMA as being an expert ,COMMA Larry Page told me that that's what they're trying to do ,COMMA and that's what they're trying to do .PERIOD <BREAK>
But it'll anticipate what we're doing ,COMMA in a good sense .PERIOD <BREAK>
And all these devices will be portals into that .PERIOD <BREAK>
It was on Jonestown .PERIOD <BREAK>
The top picture is a group of Moonies that have been blessed by their messiah .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so what is this ?QUESTIONMARK How does this work ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
These easy ideas to complex questions are very appealing when you are emotionally vulnerable .PERIOD <BREAK>
We're beginning to look inside the brain .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so if you looked at my brain ,COMMA or any brain that's infected with a viral memetic infection like this ,COMMA and compared it to anyone in this room ,COMMA or anyone who uses critical thinking on a regular basis ,COMMA I am convinced it would look very ,COMMA very different .PERIOD <BREAK>
Because I have to say ,COMMA for my whole career ,COMMA if there's anything that's been consistent ,COMMA it's been that you can't do it .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's Calvino's idea of the quickest way between two points is the circuitous line ,COMMA not the straight line .PERIOD <BREAK>
We make physical things ,COMMA buildings that become a part in an accretional process ;SEMICOLON they make cities .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I've had for 30 years an interest in a series of complexities where a series of forces are brought to bear ,COMMA and to understand the nature of the final result of that ,COMMA representing the building itself .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is a project that we just finished in Penang for a very ,COMMA very large city project that came directly out of this process ,COMMA which is the result of the multiplicity of forces that produce it .PERIOD <BREAK>
And an image which may be closest talks about the use of light as a medium ,COMMA that light becomes literally a building material .PERIOD <BREAK>
This will be the first building in the United States that took -- well ,COMMA I can't say it took the air conditioning out .PERIOD It's a hybrid .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I understood that building really could be the augmentation of the Earth's surface ,COMMA and it completely shifted the notion of building ground in the most basic sense .PERIOD <BREAK>
What I'm interested in are how these ideas participate in the educational process of young people .PERIOD <BREAK>
One enters the building as it lifts off the ground ,COMMA and it becomes part of the idea .PERIOD <BREAK>
And then the skin -- the edges of this -- all promote the dynamic ,COMMA the movement of the building as a series of seismic shifts ,COMMA geologic shifts .PERIOD Right ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And finally ,COMMA one of the most interesting projects -- it's a courthouse .PERIOD <BREAK>
Here's a piano nobile ,COMMA which is a device used in the Renaissance .PERIOD <BREAK>
It changed the way our history developed .PERIOD <BREAK>
It is made for a diet which is soft ,COMMA mushy ,COMMA which is reduced in fibers ,COMMA which is very easily chewable and digestible .PERIOD <BREAK>
Sounds like fast food ,COMMA doesn't it .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's technology .PERIOD <BREAK>
So this ingenuity of our ancestors ,COMMA to invent this most marvelous technology .PERIOD <BREAK>
We populated all the ecologies .PERIOD <BREAK>
It keeps also your brain working .PERIOD <BREAK>
Okay ,COMMA it's not obvious to be honest .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now having a large brain ,COMMA as you know ,COMMA is a big advantage ,COMMA because you can actually influence your environment .PERIOD <BREAK>
You know we have up to five tastes ,COMMA three of them sustain us .PERIOD <BREAK>
So we can make mixtures of all this kind of thing because we know that ,COMMA in cooking ,COMMA we can transform it to the form .PERIOD <BREAK>
So satisfaction was a very important part .PERIOD <BREAK>
If you get a stomach ache ,COMMA if you get a little bit bloated ,COMMA was not the right food ,COMMA was not the right cooking manipulation or maybe other things went wrong .PERIOD <BREAK>
But what it means to have a brain there is that ,COMMA not only the big brain has to talk with the food ,COMMA the food has to talk with the brain ,COMMA because we have to learn actually how to talk to the brains .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is the layer which actually touches the food you are swallowing and you digest ,COMMA which is actually the lumen .PERIOD <BREAK>
What it means is that we have a layered control system .PERIOD <BREAK>
So if you override the hunger signal ,COMMA you can have a disorder ,COMMA which is called anorexia .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is fat digestion .PERIOD <BREAK>
Actually ,COMMA what happens is that a very intricate structure appears .PERIOD <BREAK>
You know ,COMMA culture was born of the imagination ,COMMA and the imagination -- the imagination as we know it -- came into being when our species descended from our progenitor ,COMMA Homo erectus ,COMMA and ,COMMA infused with consciousness ,COMMA began a journey that would carry it to every corner of the habitable world .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the way Clayton put it was this way .PERIOD <BREAK>
I recently sailed on the Hokulea ,COMMA named after the sacred star of Hawaii ,COMMA throughout the South Pacific to make a film about the navigators .PERIOD <BREAK>
I spent 30 years living amongst the people of Chinchero and I always heard about an event that I always wanted to participate in .PERIOD <BREAK>
And then you do the ritual dances that empower the crosses .PERIOD <BREAK>
These ,COMMA of course ,COMMA are the descendants of the ancient Tairona civilization .PERIOD <BREAK>
There are four societies :COLON the Kogi ,COMMA the Wiwa ,COMMA the Kankwano and the Arhuacos .PERIOD <BREAK>
I traveled with the Arhuacos ,COMMA and the wonderful thing about this story was that this man ,COMMA Danilo Villafane -- if we just jump back here for a second .PERIOD <BREAK>
We traveled high into the paramo ,COMMA and as we crested the hills ,COMMA we realized that the men were interpreting every single bump on the landscape in terms of their own intense religiosity .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we ran into a FARC patrol at dawn ,COMMA so it was quite harrowing .PERIOD <BREAK>
They dismiss the rest of us who have ruined the world as the Younger Brothers .PERIOD They cannot understand why it is that we do what we do to the Earth .PERIOD <BREAK>
And when asked that question ,COMMA they respond with 6000 different voices .PERIOD <BREAK>
They are unique answers to that fundamental question :COLON what does it mean to be human and alive ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
So ,COMMA you're living through a time when virtually half of humanity's intellectual ,COMMA social and spiritual legacy is being allowed to slip away .PERIOD <BREAK>
This does not have to happen .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA I'd like to spend a few minutes with you folks today imagining what our planet might look like in a thousand years .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is crazy .PERIOD <BREAK>
If you're in Northern Europe or North America ,COMMA you can use things like buckwheat husks or oat hulls .PERIOD <BREAK>
Because the manufacturing process is our organism .PERIOD <BREAK>
They're not going to clog up Earth's ecosystems .PERIOD They work great .PERIOD <BREAK>
My brief ,COMMA as you've just heard ,COMMA is to tell you about statistics -- and ,COMMA to be more precise ,COMMA to tell you some exciting things about statistics .PERIOD <BREAK>
Don't tell her I said that .PERIOD <BREAK>
She paused and said ,COMMA He models things .PERIOD <BREAK>
The next time ,COMMA after the 15 th toss .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's what I want this side to think about .PERIOD <BREAK>
Either they're the same ,COMMA or this one's bigger than this one ,COMMA or this one's bigger than that one .PERIOD <BREAK>
Who thinks that C is true -- that ,COMMA on average ,COMMA it'll take less time to see head-tail-head than head-tail-tail ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
The champagne's on ice just next to you ;SEMICOLON you've got the glasses chilled to celebrate .PERIOD <BREAK>
And if it comes down a head ,COMMA that's great .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's the same for the first two parts of the sequence .PERIOD <BREAK>
If it's a head you're disappointed ,COMMA but you're still a third of the way to your pattern again .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is my little diversion into my real passion ,COMMA which is genetics .PERIOD <BREAK>
When you toss a coin ,COMMA you get a sequence of heads and tails .PERIOD <BREAK>
And they're an enormously useful tool in modern molecular biology .PERIOD <BREAK>
But it turns out that unlocking the secrets in the information generated by modern experimental technologies ,COMMA a key part of that has to do with fairly sophisticated -- you'll be relieved to know that I do something useful in my day job ,COMMA rather more sophisticated than the head-tail-head story -- but quite sophisticated computer modelings and mathematical modelings and modern statistical techniques .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's not the answer ,COMMA and it's not because it's only part of the story .PERIOD <BREAK>
Here's a little caricature of a million individuals .PERIOD <BREAK>
Those of you in Britain will know about what's become rather a celebrated case of a woman called Sally Clark ,COMMA who had two babies who died suddenly .PERIOD <BREAK>
And to argue ,COMMA then ,COMMA that the chance of a second death is as if you didn't know that information is really silly .PERIOD <BREAK>
One of them is that Sally Clark was innocent -- which is ,COMMA a priori ,COMMA overwhelmingly likely -- most mothers don't kill their children .PERIOD <BREAK>
So just to conclude -- what are the take-home messages from this ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
We are not good at reasoning with uncertainty .PERIOD <BREAK>
All of quality control ,COMMA which has had a major impact on industrial processing ,COMMA is underpinned by statistics .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is a world-changing invention .PERIOD <BREAK>
Well it turns out that the main causes are faulty and misused appliances and electrical wiring .PERIOD <BREAK>
Hmmm .PERIOD <BREAK>
So far we've applied for 414 patent claims .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA to conclude ,COMMA intelligent power can ,COMMA globally ,COMMA save thousands of lives ,COMMA prevent tens of thousands of injuries ,COMMA and eliminate tens of billions of dollars in property damage every single year ,COMMA while significantly reducing global energy consumption .PERIOD <BREAK>
In the spirit of this year's TED Conference ,COMMA we think this is a powerful ,COMMA world-changing invention .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that's what I'd like to talk to you a little bit about today .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's acoustic vibrations in the air ,COMMA little waves of energy in the air that tickle our eardrum .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it's at the hair cell level that they do this .PERIOD <BREAK>
In fact ,COMMA nothing even actually comes close to our ability to restore hearing .PERIOD <BREAK>
And as a physician and a surgeon ,COMMA I can confidently tell my patients that if you had to pick a sense to lose ,COMMA we are the furthest along medically and surgically with hearing .PERIOD <BREAK>
Okay ,COMMA play that video please .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'm saying that they're going to face obstacles that most people who have normal hearing will not have to face .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now hearing loss and the treatment for hearing loss has really evolved in the past 200 years .PERIOD <BREAK>
I mean literally ,COMMA they used to do things like stick ear-shaped objects onto your ears and stick funnels in .PERIOD <BREAK>
Language is very different .PERIOD Language is very precise .PERIOD <BREAK>
In fact ,COMMA the whole reason we use it is because it has semantic-specificity .PERIOD <BREAK>
But it certainly wasn't the way the music was intended .PERIOD <BREAK>
What that suggests is that ,COMMA even in the case of hearing loss ,COMMA the capacity for music remains .PERIOD <BREAK>
And here's a video of Joseph .PERIOD <BREAK>
Joseph :COLON I was born in 1986 .PERIOD <BREAK>
When I was 12 years old ,COMMA I was one of the first few people in Singapore who underwent cochlear implantation .PERIOD <BREAK>
And this is really unheard of stuff ,COMMA and this is all because of this technology .PERIOD <BREAK>
You don't actually have to hear it .PERIOD <BREAK>
I know he doesn't hear well ,COMMA because I've heard him do Karaoke .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so this idea has a lot of traction with us .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so ,COMMA I'm here to tell you ,COMMA you don't need a computer to actually have a spell .PERIOD In fact ,COMMA what you can do at the molecular level is that if you encode information -- you encode a spell or program as molecules -- then physics can actually directly interpret that information and run a program .PERIOD That's what happens in proteins .PERIOD <BREAK>
When this amino acid sequence gets pronounced as atoms ,COMMA these little letters are sticky for each other .PERIOD <BREAK>
So here's a shape .PERIOD I actually spent about a year in my home ,COMMA in my underwear ,COMMA coding ,COMMA like Linus [Torvalds] ,COMMA in that picture before .PERIOD <BREAK>
I mix them together ,COMMA add a little bit of salt water ,COMMA and then add this long strand I was telling you about ,COMMA that I've stolen from a virus .PERIOD And then what happens is ,COMMA you heat this whole thing up to about boiling .PERIOD You cool it down to room temperature ,COMMA and as you do ,COMMA what happens is those short strands ,COMMA they do the following thing :COLON each one of them binds that long strand in one place ,COMMA and then has a second half that binds that long strand in a distant place ,COMMA and brings those two parts of the long strand close together so that they stick together .PERIOD <BREAK>
You can make a molecule that looks like this ,COMMA and ,COMMA you know ,COMMA he likes to hang out with his buddies ,COMMA right .PERIOD <BREAK>
So that's DNA origami .PERIOD That's one way .PERIOD There are many ways of casting molecular spells using DNA .PERIOD <BREAK>
I did not choose to take up the pen ,COMMA the brush ,COMMA the camera .PERIOD <BREAK>
Why did I choose the gun as my instrument ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
My father was a hardworking baker ,COMMA but when he had finished work in the bakery ,COMMA he often told me and my brother stories .PERIOD <BREAK>
My father was there to provide it .PERIOD <BREAK>
He fired .PERIOD Nothing happened .PERIOD <BREAK>
The murder rate in Europe has dropped by a factor of 30 since the Middle Ages .PERIOD <BREAK>
Why has violence decreased ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Or is there something else ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
The armed forces implement the state monopoly on violence .PERIOD <BREAK>
My soldiers use the gun as an instrument of peace .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that is why -- and in The Netherlands ,COMMA we are very unique in that -- that is why the Dutch constitution states that one of the main tasks of the armed forces is to uphold and promote the international rule of law .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I hope that one day armies can be disbanded and humans will find a way of living together without violence and oppression .PERIOD <BREAK>
I hope you will support our soldiers when they are out there ,COMMA when they come home and when they are injured and need our care .PERIOD <BREAK>
You're climbing on little dimples and nubbins in the rock .PERIOD <BREAK>
Women are much more in balance because they don't have that idea that they're going to be able to do 100 pull-ups .PERIOD <BREAK>
They think about how to get the weight over their feet because it's sort of natural -- they carry you all day long .PERIOD <BREAK>
It took us 15 years to sequence HIV -- we sequenced SARS in 31 days .PERIOD <BREAK>
If you put different communication technologies on this logarithmic graph ,COMMA television ,COMMA radio ,COMMA telephone were adopted in decades .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now by the way ,COMMA if you look at this on a linear graph ,COMMA it looks like everything has just happened ,COMMA but some observer says ,COMMA Well ,COMMA Kurzweil just put points on this graph that fall on that straight line .PERIOD <BREAK>
And again ,COMMA it forms the same straight line .PERIOD You have a little bit of thickening in the line because people do have disagreements ,COMMA what the key points are ,COMMA there's differences of opinion when agriculture started ,COMMA or how long the Cambrian Explosion took .PERIOD <BREAK>
It took us three years to double our price performance of computing in 1900 ,COMMA two years in the middle ;SEMICOLON we're now doubling it every one year .PERIOD <BREAK>
Supercomputers -- same thing .PERIOD <BREAK>
You would think it would be a very erratic process ,COMMA and you have a very smooth outcome of this chaotic process .PERIOD <BREAK>
As we make them smaller and less expensive ,COMMA the electrons have less distance to travel .PERIOD <BREAK>
And economists have actually started worrying about that .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is due to greater productivity ,COMMA but the economist says ,COMMA But there's no way you're going to be able to keep up with that .PERIOD <BREAK>
These were evolved in very different times -- we'd like to actually change those programs .PERIOD <BREAK>
We'd like to actually turn that program off .PERIOD <BREAK>
Four or five pharmaceutical companies have noticed this ,COMMA felt that would be interesting drug for the human market ,COMMA and that's just one of the 30000 genes that affect our biochemistry .PERIOD <BREAK>
For example ,COMMA we can inhibit genes now with RNA interference .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's now under a 10 th of a cent .PERIOD <BREAK>
Once we understand its principles of operation ,COMMA and the pace with which we are reverse-engineering biology is accelerating ,COMMA we can actually design these things to be thousands of times more capable .PERIOD <BREAK>
Where will we get the software ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Wall Street noticed that this was a revolutionary technology ,COMMA which it was ,COMMA but then six months later ,COMMA when it hadn't revolutionized all business models ,COMMA they figured ,COMMA well ,COMMA that was wrong ,COMMA and then we had this bust .PERIOD <BREAK>
Images will be written directly to our retina ,COMMA providing full-immersion virtual reality ,COMMA augmented real reality .PERIOD We'll be interacting with virtual personalities .PERIOD <BREAK>
You can go there with other people ,COMMA have any kind of experience with anyone involving all of the senses .PERIOD <BREAK>
But most importantly ,COMMA it'll be a tremendous expansion of human intelligence through this direct merger with our technology ,COMMA which in some sense we're doing already .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's just like this one ,COMMA completely worthless ,COMMA in which it allegedly worked by electrostatic magnetic ion attraction ,COMMA which translates to pseudoscientific baloney -- would be the nice word -- in which you string together a bunch of words that sound good ,COMMA but it does absolutely nothing .PERIOD <BREAK>
In this case ,COMMA at trespass points ,COMMA allowing people to go through because your little tracker device said they were okay ,COMMA actually cost lives .PERIOD <BREAK>
And in fact ,COMMA I think my thesis here is that belief is the natural state of things .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that's called superstition ,COMMA and that ,COMMA I'm afraid ,COMMA we will always have with us .PERIOD <BREAK>
You are a hominid three million years ago walking on the plains of Africa .PERIOD <BREAK>
You've been taken out of the gene pool .PERIOD <BREAK>
The fish is degraded 20 percent ,COMMA 50 percent and then the one I showed you ,COMMA 70 percent .PERIOD <BREAK>
And if you give them drugs that are dopamine antagonists ,COMMA they go away .PERIOD <BREAK>
Every time somebody looks at you ,COMMA you think people are staring at you .PERIOD <BREAK>
Because the lights on here .PERIOD <BREAK>
So what you see in this particular ambiguous figure is ,COMMA of course ,COMMA the dolphins ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
That's a dolphin tail there ,COMMA guys .PERIOD <BREAK>
So you recognize Obama immediately .PERIOD <BREAK>
And this is also ,COMMA I think ,COMMA the basis of conspiracy theories .PERIOD <BREAK>
Explains a lot ,COMMA maybe .PERIOD <BREAK>
Well ,COMMA that's a whole other lecture .PERIOD <BREAK>
We know that if you stimulate the temporal lobe ,COMMA you can produce a feeling of out-of-body experiences ,COMMA near-death experiences ,COMMA which you can do by just touching an electrode to the temporal lobe there .PERIOD <BREAK>
And you get a sense of out-of-body experience .PERIOD <BREAK>
It ties together all this into the power of expectation and the power of belief .PERIOD <BREAK>
Okay ,COMMA now I'm going to ask you to pucker up .PERIOD <BREAK>
Pucker up big and lean in just a little bit ,COMMA okay ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Jennifer :COLON The man came and started undressing me .PERIOD <BREAK>
Woman :COLON They insisted that I was lying .PERIOD <BREAK>
Text :COLON Uganda ratified the Convention Against Torture in 1986 .PERIOD <BREAK>
Torture is defined as any act by which severe pain of suffering ,COMMA whether physical or mental ,COMMA is intentionally inflicted by a person acting in an official capacity to obtain information or a confession ,COMMA to punish ,COMMA coerce or intimidate .PERIOD <BREAK>
And as the story of Mr .PERIOD Morales ,COMMA just down the road ,COMMA excuse me ,COMMA Mr .PERIOD Gabriel ,COMMA would you mind if we delayed your execution a little bit ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
WITNESS .PERIOD <BREAK>
There could be a new movement growing up ,COMMA rising from the ground ,COMMA reaching for the light ,COMMA and growing strong ,COMMA just like a tree .PERIOD Thank you .PERIOD <BREAK>
So in that 18 minutes ,COMMA or 10 minutes ,COMMA or five minutes ,COMMA you have to convey a whole bunch of different characteristics .PERIOD <BREAK>
Next up is knowledge .PERIOD <BREAK>
You walk in the door .PERIOD So the first thing you've got to do -- the overall ,COMMA you know ,COMMA arc of your presentation -- it's got to start like a rocket .PERIOD <BREAK>
And everything has got to be reinforcing this .PERIOD <BREAK>
Okay ,COMMA so how do you do that ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Well ,COMMA first of all ,COMMA logical progression .PERIOD <BREAK>
You've also got to let me know that there are touchstones .PERIOD <BREAK>
You want to tie in to the rest of the world out there .PERIOD <BREAK>
So this all feeds in together .PERIOD <BREAK>
You want absolute -- this is the Zen of presentation ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
So with that said ,COMMA we only have a very ,COMMA very short time .PERIOD <BREAK>
You do that ,COMMA you give me your quick 15 -second or 30 -second intro ,COMMA grab my attention .PERIOD <BREAK>
We build widgets for the X ,COMMA Y ,COMMA Z market .PERIOD <BREAK>
If it's a website ,COMMA show me a screenshot of your website .PERIOD <BREAK>
Five is a bit much .PERIOD Probably four is rational .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I look at the logo -- okay ,COMMA good .PERIOD <BREAK>
PowerPoint has this built into every copy of PowerPoint that's shipped .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the number one presentation tip :COLON never ,COMMA ever look at the screen .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that is how to pitch to a VC .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'm here today to start a revolution .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now before you get up in arms ,COMMA or you break into song ,COMMA or you pick a favorite color ,COMMA I want to define what I mean by revolution .PERIOD <BREAK>
We're last place in health care ,COMMA and that's important for a sense of well-being .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's social .PERIOD Let's look at education .PERIOD <BREAK>
Because it's shown the way we apply ,COMMA generate and use knowledge is affected by our social and institutional context ,COMMA which told us what in communism ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
It's a serious gene .PERIOD <BREAK>
True story :COLON I went looking for a school for my kid .PERIOD <BREAK>
It can't be because of play .PERIOD <BREAK>
Throughout the animal kingdom ,COMMA for example :COLON ants .PERIOD Ants play .PERIOD <BREAK>
Kittens play .PERIOD We all know kittens play .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it's not just kids ,COMMA it's adults too .PERIOD <BREAK>
These guys are facts .PERIOD <BREAK>
The opposite of play is not work .PERIOD <BREAK>
Just like there's benefits for humans and animals ,COMMA there's benefits for play at work .PERIOD <BREAK>
You know ,COMMA the professional athlete that loves skiing ,COMMA he's serious about it ,COMMA but he loves it .PERIOD <BREAK>
A doctor might be serious ,COMMA but laughter's still a great medicine .PERIOD <BREAK>
You guys have to ,COMMA and if you're not feeling it ,COMMA your colleagues ,COMMA your employees ,COMMA aren't going to feel it .PERIOD <BREAK>
Fear is the enemy of play .PERIOD <BREAK>
Let them take long lunches .PERIOD <BREAK>
What we need is a players' uprising .PERIOD <BREAK>
What we need is a players' uprising .PERIOD <BREAK>
What we need is a players' uprising .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I am illustrating Still .PERIOD <BREAK>
Which ,COMMA of course ,COMMA I am not agreeing with because ,COMMA although I am 94 ,COMMA I am not still working .PERIOD <BREAK>
I still have -- or did I use the word still ?QUESTIONMARK I didn't mean that .PERIOD <BREAK>
These were just some of the things I've made .PERIOD <BREAK>
These are tiles .PERIOD The word ,COMMA playful is a necessary aspect of our work because ,COMMA actually ,COMMA one of our problems is that we have to make ,COMMA produce ,COMMA lovely things throughout all of life ,COMMA and this for me is now 75 years .PERIOD <BREAK>
So how can you ,COMMA without drying up ,COMMA make things with the same pleasure ,COMMA as a gift to others ,COMMA for so long ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
I started as an apprentice to a Hungarian craftsman ,COMMA and this taught me what the guild system was in Middle Ages .PERIOD <BREAK>
We mashed the clay with our feet when it came from the hillside .PERIOD <BREAK>
And finally ,COMMA I had received a document that I had accomplished my apprenticeship successfully ,COMMA that I had behaved morally ,COMMA and this document was given to me by the Guild of Roof-Coverers ,COMMA Rail-Diggers ,COMMA Oven-Setters ,COMMA Chimney Sweeps and Potters .PERIOD <BREAK>
I also got at the time a workbook which explained my rights and my working conditions ,COMMA and I still have that workbook .PERIOD <BREAK>
My mother thought that this was not very proper ,COMMA so she sat with us to add propriety to this activity .PERIOD <BREAK>
However ,COMMA the director ,COMMA the chemist ,COMMA model maker -- everybody -- concerned himself much more with the art department -- that means ,COMMA with my work -- than making toilets ,COMMA so finally they got a letter from the center ,COMMA from the bank who owned the factory ,COMMA saying ,COMMA make toilet-setting behind the art department ,COMMA and that was my end .PERIOD <BREAK>
So I will try speed it up a little Moderator :COLON Eva ,COMMA we have about five minutes .PERIOD <BREAK>
The accusation was that I had successfully prepared an Attentat on Stalin's life .PERIOD <BREAK>
But since I survived and I'm here ,COMMA and since this is the end of the five minutes ,COMMA I will -- Moderator :COLON Tell me when your last trip to Russia was .PERIOD <BREAK>
Oh ,COMMA this summer ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA the Lomonosov factory was bought by an American company ,COMMA invited me .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's my camera lens .PERIOD The first one -- the one I shot my Bob Dylan film with 35 years ago .PERIOD <BREAK>
I called my sister .PERIOD I called my neighbors .PERIOD I said ,COMMA Come dig .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's my sister .PERIOD She took care of pictures ,COMMA because I was a big collector of snapshot photography that I believed said a lot .PERIOD <BREAK>
She's still there .PERIOD She's there this morning ,COMMA actually .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we went into parenting expecting our lives to look like this .PERIOD <BREAK>
The nurse was coming at me with this beautiful ,COMMA beautiful child ,COMMA and I remember ,COMMA as she was approaching me ,COMMA the voices of friends saying ,COMMA The moment they put the baby in your hands ,COMMA you will feel a sense of love that will come over you that is [on] an order of magnitude more powerful than anything you've ever experienced in your entire life .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it was also ,COMMA of course ,COMMA surreal .PERIOD <BREAK>
You're either in love ,COMMA or you're not in love .PERIOD <BREAK>
I enjoyed being pregnant .PERIOD I loved it .PERIOD <BREAK>
Of those ,COMMA 67 percent are most lonely when their kids are zero to five -- probably really zero to two .PERIOD <BREAK>
In the process of preparing this ,COMMA we looked at how some other cultures around the world deal with this period of time ,COMMA because here in the Western world ,COMMA less than 50 percent of us live near our family members ,COMMA which I think is part of why this is such a tough period .PERIOD <BREAK>
The party line is that every single aspect of my life has just gotten dramatically better ever since I participated in the miracle that is childbirth and family .PERIOD <BREAK>
As you get older ,COMMA you become more stable .PERIOD <BREAK>
You start to realize that Hey ,COMMA I could go to this live music event and have an utterly transforming experience that will cover my entire body with goosebumps ,COMMA but it's more likely that I'll feel claustrophobic and I won't be able to get a beer .PERIOD <BREAK>
So your average happiness goes up ,COMMA but you lose those transcendent moments .PERIOD <BREAK>
But you realize you resubmit yourself to losing control in a really wonderful way ,COMMA which we think provides a lot of meaning to our lives and is quite gratifying .PERIOD <BREAK>
We trade the sort of security and safety of a certain level of contentment for these transcendent moments .PERIOD <BREAK>
So where does that leave the two of us as a family with our three little boys in the thick of all this ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
There's another factor in our case .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we had reservations about this on the front end .PERIOD <BREAK>
Get out of the airplane ,COMMA it turns out you're trekking in Nepal .PERIOD <BREAK>
RG + AV :COLON Thank you .PERIOD <BREAK>
We crave to be in the room with the musician the day it was recorded ,COMMA the day it was played .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we go to live concerts ,COMMA and we get that as much as we can .PERIOD <BREAK>
And Yamaha makes an incredible thing called the Disklavier Pro that looks like a nice grand piano there .PERIOD <BREAK>
He just got tired of being in front of an audience ,COMMA and felt like -- a performing monkey was ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA his term .PERIOD <BREAK>
His maybe most famous recording was something called The Goldberg Variations .PERIOD <BREAK>
He wrote some early pieces ,COMMA but late in his life ,COMMA in his mature period ,COMMA he said ,COMMA Here's a theme -- 30 variations .PERIOD <BREAK>
And Gould recorded it in two major recordings that you may know about ,COMMA one in mono ,COMMA and one in stereo .PERIOD <BREAK>
What I'd like you to hear live is the 1955 version ,COMMA and we'll play the first couple pieces of it .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA in the video world ,COMMA we've been able to invent ,COMMA in our lifetimes ,COMMA natural behavior .PERIOD <BREAK>
And when you put on headphones ,COMMA and you listen to this ,COMMA you're inside of Glenn Gould's body .PERIOD <BREAK>
Your eyes are pretty happy with some color and movement ,COMMA you know .PERIOD <BREAK>
You want to hear it in different rooms and whatever .PERIOD <BREAK>
We made a new recording of him playing in the Shrine Auditorium in September .PERIOD <BREAK>
And fortunately ,COMMA it's right in here .PERIOD <BREAK>
I want to start just by saying a bit about where I'm coming from .PERIOD <BREAK>
I trained briefly as a Buddhist monk under this guy .PERIOD <BREAK>
And although that was great for the music business at the time ,COMMA it wasn't much good for anything else .PERIOD <BREAK>
Unprecedented wealth and prosperity ,COMMA but that growth hasn't always delivered what we needed .PERIOD <BREAK>
Rates of depression carried on up ,COMMA right across the Western world .PERIOD <BREAK>
They bring ideas from the margins into the mainstream .PERIOD <BREAK>
Ronald Reagan ,COMMA again ,COMMA said the two funniest sentences in the English language are ,COMMA I'm from the government .PERIOD And I'm here to help .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I think more and more people are also asking :COLON Why boost consumption ,COMMA rather than change what we consume ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
It's not that our scientists are necessarily much smarter than they were a hundred years ago ,COMMA maybe they are ,COMMA but they have a hell of a lot more backing than they ever did .PERIOD <BREAK>
And he believed we live with others ,COMMA we share the world with others and therefore our innovation must be done with others too ,COMMA not doing things at people ,COMMA for them ,COMMA and so on .PERIOD <BREAK>
Others are much more pragmatic :COLON health coaches ,COMMA learning mentors ,COMMA job clubs .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA the idea that all of this represents ,COMMA I think ,COMMA is rapidly becoming a common sense and part of how we respond to the crisis ,COMMA recognizing the need to invest in innovation for social progress as well as technological progress .PERIOD <BREAK>
There were big health innovation funds launched earlier this year in this country ,COMMA as well as a public service innovation lab .PERIOD <BREAK>
And if ,COMMA a generation or two ago ,COMMA the big challenges were ones like getting a man on the moon ,COMMA perhaps the challenges we need to set ourselves now are ones like eliminating child malnutrition ,COMMA stopping trafficking ,COMMA or one ,COMMA I think closer to home for America or Europe ,COMMA why don't we set ourselves the goal of achieving a billion extra years of life for today's citizens .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now those are all goals which could be achieved within a decade ,COMMA but only with radical and systematic experiment ,COMMA not just with technologies ,COMMA but also with lifestyles and culture and policies and institutions too .PERIOD <BREAK>
History was over and society would inevitably have to take second place to economy .PERIOD <BREAK>
Just as today ,COMMA the enthusiasts of unrestrained capitalism say it's rooted in human nature ,COMMA only now it's individualism ,COMMA inquisitiveness ,COMMA and so on .PERIOD <BREAK>
You think I've lost my way ,COMMA and somebody's going to come on the stage in a minute and guide me gently back to my seat .PERIOD <BREAK>
I want to tell you about my friend who was teaching English to adults in Abu Dhabi .PERIOD <BREAK>
And one fine day ,COMMA she decided to take them into the garden to teach them some nature vocabulary .PERIOD <BREAK>
A language dies every 14 days .PERIOD <BREAK>
That is a little bit too early .PERIOD <BREAK>
We were brought to teach English because the government wanted to modernize the country and to empower the citizens through education .PERIOD <BREAK>
But if you're not a native speaker ,COMMA you have to pass a test .PERIOD <BREAK>
Do we really want to end up with 600 languages and the main one being English ,COMMA or Chinese ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And I want to remind you that the giants upon whose shoulders today's intelligentsia stand did not have to have English ,COMMA they didn't have to pass an English test .PERIOD <BREAK>
Let me tell you a story about two scientists ,COMMA two English scientists .PERIOD <BREAK>
So he invented a cost-free solar lamp .PERIOD <BREAK>
When he received his award ,COMMA he said these lovely words :COLON The children can lead Africa from what it is today ,COMMA a dark continent ,COMMA to a light continent .PERIOD <BREAK>
I am known best for human-powered flight ,COMMA but that was just one thing that got me going in the sort of things that I'm working in now .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we thought a solar-powered plane wouldn't really make sense ,COMMA but you could do it and it would get a lot of publicity for solar power and maybe help that field .PERIOD <BREAK>
You don't need to dig down for these chemicals ,COMMA and we can do things much more efficiently .PERIOD <BREAK>
So this just summarizes it .PERIOD Over billions of years ,COMMA on a unique sphere ,COMMA chance has painted a thin covering of life -- complex and probable ,COMMA wonderful and fragile .PERIOD <BREAK>
Suddenly ,COMMA we humans ,COMMA a recently arrived species ,COMMA no longer subject to the checks and balances inherent in nature ,COMMA have grown in population ,COMMA technology and intelligence to a position of terrible power .PERIOD We ,COMMA now ,COMMA wield the paintbrush .PERIOD <BREAK>
Okay ,COMMA and let's have the next .PERIOD <BREAK>
And then also ,COMMA like it said in the video ,COMMA you can turn it left or right just by putting the lift under one wing or another .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that's it ,COMMA yeah ,COMMA just a few inventions .PERIOD <BREAK>
Most of the talks that you've heard in the last several fabulous days have been from people who have the characteristic that they have thought about something ,COMMA they are experts ,COMMA they know what's going on .PERIOD <BREAK>
All of you know about the topic that I'm supposed to talk about .PERIOD <BREAK>
Well ,COMMA it enables you to drink coffee .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the other ,COMMA of course ,COMMA is a birth control pill ,COMMA which ,COMMA in a very simple way ,COMMA fundamentally changed the structure of society by changing the role of women in it by providing to them the opportunity to make reproductive choices .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's like ,COMMA what is simplicity ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
What is the state of science ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And ,COMMA interestingly ,COMMA complexity is very highly evolved .PERIOD <BREAK>
One of the things I want to do is to help you with a very important task -- which you may not know that you have very often -- which is to understand how to sit next to a physicist at a dinner party and have a conversation .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the words that I would like you to focus on are complexity and emergence ,COMMA because these will enable you to start the conversation and then daydream about other things .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that's complexity .PERIOD <BREAK>
All right ,COMMA so let me give you an example of simplicity of a particular kind .PERIOD <BREAK>
The question is :COLON Why is binary simpler than Arabic ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And this is a map of bitflows across the continent .PERIOD <BREAK>
That is ,COMMA you can stack them .PERIOD <BREAK>
And you put a drop ,COMMA in this case ,COMMA of urine at the bottom .PERIOD <BREAK>
It turns colors .PERIOD In this particular case ,COMMA you're reading kidney function .PERIOD <BREAK>
If you take too much out of something that's simple ,COMMA you lose function .PERIOD <BREAK>
So you can't make it too simple .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the second is a design issue ,COMMA and it's not directly relevant ,COMMA but it's a nice statement .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA what I think one can begin to do with this kind of cut at the word simplicity ,COMMA which doesn't cover Brancusi ,COMMA it doesn't answer the question of why Mondrian is better or worse or simpler or less simpler than Van Gogh ,COMMA and certainly doesn't address the question of whether Mozart is simpler than Bach .PERIOD <BREAK>
You've got a company set up to .PERIOD <BREAK>
I want to open by quoting Einstein's wonderful statement ,COMMA just so people will feel at ease that the great scientist of the 20 th century also agrees with us ,COMMA and also calls us to this action .PERIOD <BREAK>
I know the next Buddha will come a few thousand years from now ,COMMA but exists currently in a certain heaven -- that's Maitreya -- so ,COMMA I'm going to go on a retreat and I'm going to meditate and pray until the Buddha Maitreya reveals himself to me ,COMMA and gives me a teaching or something to revive the practice of compassion in the world today .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the man said ,COMMA Really ?QUESTIONMARK And he showed him a dish full of needles .PERIOD <BREAK>
So he said ,COMMA Okay ,COMMA I get the point .PERIOD <BREAK>
He went back to his cave .PERIOD He meditated again .PERIOD <BREAK>
Another three years ,COMMA no vision .PERIOD He leaves again .PERIOD <BREAK>
So he thought ,COMMA I will take the maggots and put them on this piece of flesh ,COMMA then clean the dog's wounds ,COMMA and then I'll figure out what to do with the maggots .PERIOD <BREAK>
So he starts to do that .PERIOD He can't grab the maggots .PERIOD <BREAK>
He jumps back and there ,COMMA of course ,COMMA is the future Buddha Maitreya in a beautiful vision -- rainbow lights ,COMMA golden ,COMMA jeweled ,COMMA a plasma body ,COMMA an exquisite mystic vision -- that he sees .PERIOD <BREAK>
So as he comes up from his first bow he says ,COMMA My Lord ,COMMA I'm so happy to see you ,COMMA but where have you been for 12 years ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And Maitreya says ,COMMA I was with you .PERIOD Who do you think was making needles and making nests and dripping on rocks for you ,COMMA mister dense ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Looking for the Buddha in person ,COMMA he said .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA naturally ,COMMA they chased him out of town .PERIOD <BREAK>
You gave me that expression ;SEMICOLON the eternal mama ,COMMA you said .PERIOD That's wonderful .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA they first create this foundation of equality .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we don't hate anyone ,COMMA therefore .PERIOD So we equalize .PERIOD That's very important .PERIOD <BREAK>
And this is the way you do it .PERIOD You take any being who looks weird to you ,COMMA and you see how they could be familiar to you .PERIOD <BREAK>
You reduce the feeling of otherness about beings .PERIOD <BREAK>
And then you connect that with your feeling that everyone has that motherly possibility .PERIOD <BREAK>
And they ,COMMA then ,COMMA never get any positive feedback .PERIOD <BREAK>
Compassion makes you happy .PERIOD <BREAK>
The first person who is happy when you get great compassion is yourself ,COMMA even if you haven't done anything yet for anybody else .PERIOD <BREAK>
Because traditional economic theory would say ,COMMA well ,COMMA the mountain bike was probably invented by some big bike corporation that had a big R&ampD lab where they were thinking up new projects ,COMMA and it came out of there .PERIOD It didn't come from there .PERIOD <BREAK>
The ideas are coming back from the consumers ,COMMA and they're often ahead of the producers .PERIOD <BREAK>
The very first landline telephones ,COMMA the inventors thought that they would be used for people to listen in to live performances from West End theaters .PERIOD <BREAK>
More and more ,COMMA the inventors of things will not be able to say that in advance .PERIOD <BREAK>
The second reason why users are more and more important is that they are the source of big ,COMMA disruptive innovations .PERIOD <BREAK>
Take astronomy as an example ,COMMA which Yochai has already mentioned .PERIOD <BREAK>
What does this mean ,COMMA then ,COMMA for our organizational landscape ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Let me just give you two examples .PERIOD <BREAK>
Which venture capitalist in their right mind is going to give you any money to set up a venture competing with Microsoft ,COMMA with Microsoft Outlook ?QUESTIONMARK No one .PERIOD <BREAK>
Because the professionals ,COMMA over here in these closed organizations -- they might be academics ;SEMICOLON they might be programmers ;SEMICOLON they might be doctors ;SEMICOLON they might be journalists -- my former profession -- say ,COMMA No ,COMMA no -- you can't trust these people over here .PERIOD <BREAK>
They want to ,COMMA as Jimmy said ,COMMA they want to have a dialogue ,COMMA a conversation .PERIOD <BREAK>
What should be the role of public policy ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And I was having dinner with this guy called Timothy Chan .PERIOD <BREAK>
Didn't go into the Internet ,COMMA kept his money ,COMMA decided to go into computer games .PERIOD <BREAK>
At any one time ,COMMA there are four million people playing one of his games .PERIOD <BREAK>
How many people does he employ to service that population ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Well ,COMMA how can he service 250 million people from 500 employees ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Imagine you could take all the children in education in Britain ,COMMA and one percent of them were co-developers of education .PERIOD <BREAK>
Or if you got one percent of the patients in the NHS to ,COMMA in some sense ,COMMA be co-producers of health .PERIOD <BREAK>
For example ,COMMA I get people to dress up their vacuum cleaners .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I figured I'd put it on the Internet for all employees under stress to help you better deal with what you're going through on your job .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so I said ,COMMA Let's put this together in an album .PERIOD <BREAK>
We can build all sorts of environments to make it a little bit easier ,COMMA but ultimately ,COMMA what we're trying to do is really connect with one other person .PERIOD <BREAK>
Recording :COLON Okay ,COMMA here's something .PERIOD <BREAK>
But sometimes I feel really lonely .PERIOD <BREAK>
Like even people in convenience stores saying ,COMMA Have a nice day ,COMMA when they're accidentally looking me in the eye .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I got a lot ,COMMA like 30 in a half an hour .PERIOD <BREAK>
I was like ,COMMA I don't know .PERIOD <BREAK>
But anyway ,COMMA this same person ,COMMA Laura ,COMMA ended up emailing me a little bit after that project .PERIOD <BREAK>
So I asked her ,COMMA What does it feel like when you feel this way ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
I said ,COMMA Okay ,COMMA I'll think about it .PERIOD <BREAK>
And when you put them together ,COMMA something magical happens ,COMMA something absolutely incredible happens ,COMMA and all of a sudden I get a chorus from around the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
And over the past 35 years ,COMMA I've studied behavior on the basis of everything from genes through neurotransmitters ,COMMA dopamine ,COMMA things like that ,COMMA all the way through circuit analysis .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's really a very precisely timed thing .PERIOD <BREAK>
So there is the pattern that every one of them had ,COMMA but they all were a little different too .PERIOD <BREAK>
A key thing is that the major violence genes ,COMMA it's called the MAO-A gene .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's on the X chromosome .PERIOD And so in this way you can only get it from your mother .PERIOD <BREAK>
And what I think might happen in these areas of the world ,COMMA where we have constant violence ,COMMA you end up having generations of kids that are seeing all this violence .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now I said ,COMMA Okay ,COMMA so what ?QUESTIONMARK We have Lizzie .PERIOD <BREAK>
But it doesn't stop there .PERIOD <BREAK>
But there's gonna be bad news somewhere .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's the biggest scientific experiment ever attempted .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA you might be asking ,COMMA Why ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Absolutely everything .PERIOD <BREAK>
Actually ,COMMA if you just look at your thumbnail -- about a square centimeter -- there are something like 60 billion neutrinos per second from the sun ,COMMA passing through every square centimeter of your body .PERIOD <BREAK>
And these particles have been discovered over the last century ,COMMA pretty much .PERIOD <BREAK>
One of the wonderful things ,COMMA actually ,COMMA I find ,COMMA is that we've discovered any of them ,COMMA when you realize how tiny they are .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA one of my most illustrious forebears at Manchester University ,COMMA Ernest Rutherford ,COMMA discoverer of the atomic nucleus ,COMMA once said ,COMMA All science is either physics or stamp collecting .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA I don't think he meant to insult the rest of science ,COMMA although he was from New Zealand ,COMMA so it's possible .PERIOD <BREAK>
But imagine someone who's not very popular moves through the room .PERIOD <BREAK>
The picture is that the electrons and the quarks in your body and in the universe that we see around us are heavy ,COMMA in a sense ,COMMA and massive ,COMMA because they're surrounded by Higgs particles .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is a creation story ,COMMA I think ,COMMA equally as wonderful .PERIOD <BREAK>
So that's the LHC .PERIOD <BREAK>
When I grew up and realized that science fiction was not a good source for superpowers ,COMMA I decided instead to embark on a journey of real science ,COMMA to find a more useful truth .PERIOD <BREAK>
By measuring their student smiles ,COMMA researchers were able to predict how fulfilling and long-lasting a subject's marriage will be ,COMMA how well she would score on standardized tests of well-being and how inspiring she would be to others .PERIOD <BREAK>
Outside of this room ,COMMA more than a third of us smile more than 20 times per day ,COMMA whereas less than 14 percent of us smile less than five .PERIOD <BREAK>
The finding supported Darwin's theory by showing that facial feedback modifies the neural processing of emotional content in the brain in a way that helps us feel better when we smile .PERIOD <BREAK>
It is a user-appropriate technology that has been used for humanitarian good to great effect .PERIOD <BREAK>
The grassroots has been strengthened through the social power of sharing and they are challenging the old models ,COMMA the old analog models of control and command .PERIOD <BREAK>
If you were to arrive in Nairobi today and pick up a tourist map ,COMMA Kibera is represented as a lush ,COMMA green national park devoid of human settlement .PERIOD <BREAK>
They're normally backroom or basement hardware service providers ,COMMA but they need to be elevated to software strategists .PERIOD <BREAK>
But if you're like me ,COMMA my humanity is more like a window .PERIOD <BREAK>
Then suddenly I see it ,COMMA and usually ,COMMA it's never good .PERIOD <BREAK>
My mother was English .PERIOD <BREAK>
She was five foot two ,COMMA very feisty and very English .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is how English my mother is -- or was ,COMMA she just passed .PERIOD <BREAK>
And then we went to a fish restaurant ,COMMA and we had Chad ,COMMA the surfer dude ,COMMA serving us ,COMMA and he came up and my mother said ,COMMA Do you have any specials ,COMMA young man ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And my mother turned to me and said ,COMMA What language is he speaking ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
But her Igbo wasn't too good .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA here are these women ,COMMA who never discuss their period with their husbands ,COMMA and here I am telling them ,COMMA Well ,COMMA how often do you get your period ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
It was my mother with five little children .PERIOD <BREAK>
Can you imagine this five-foot-two woman ,COMMA standing up to men with guns who want to kill us ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And she said ,COMMA You know ,COMMA you can steel your heart against any kind of trouble ,COMMA any kind of horror .PERIOD <BREAK>
And then the next planting season ,COMMA when they sang the dirge ,COMMA they would remove as many names of the dead that equaled as many people that were born .PERIOD <BREAK>
Which would seem to suggest that apartheid was entirely the business of men .PERIOD <BREAK>
Their humanity never seems to matter very much to us .PERIOD <BREAK>
And a lot of rituals involved killing ,COMMA killing little animals ,COMMA progressing along ,COMMA so when I turned 13 -- and ,COMMA I mean ,COMMA it made sense ,COMMA it was an agrarian community ,COMMA somebody had to kill the animals ,COMMA there was no Whole Foods you could go and get kangaroo steak at -- so when I turned 13 ,COMMA it was my turn now to kill a goat .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA when I was growing up ,COMMA he used to tell me stories about how he used to bayonet people ,COMMA and their intestines would fall out ,COMMA but they would keep running .PERIOD <BREAK>
But he was desperate to show that he'd just come back ,COMMA so he summoned me up ,COMMA and he said ,COMMA Go into the bedroom ,COMMA my bedroom .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's basically how this thing operates .PERIOD <BREAK>
So one of the advantages of this design is ,COMMA when you scale things down ,COMMA the robot naturally becomes agile .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's inversely proportional to R .PERIOD <BREAK>
No matter how you throw it ,COMMA the robot recovers and comes back to him .PERIOD <BREAK>
So here are robots carrying beams ,COMMA columns and assembling cube-like structures .PERIOD <BREAK>
So you might want to have multiple robots carry payloads .PERIOD <BREAK>
So we use a little trick .PERIOD <BREAK>
They sense their neighbors .PERIOD <BREAK>
So again the robots monitor this error and calculate the control commands 100 times a second ,COMMA which then translates to the motor commands 600 times a second .PERIOD <BREAK>
As you can see here ,COMMA they collapse from a three-dimensional formation into planar formation .PERIOD <BREAK>
Another application I want to show you -- again ,COMMA this is in our lab .PERIOD <BREAK>
So his algorithm essentially tells these robots how to autonomously build cubic structures from truss-like elements .PERIOD <BREAK>
So all these experiments you've seen thus far ,COMMA all these demonstrations ,COMMA have been done with the help of motion capture systems .PERIOD <BREAK>
It figures out where it is with respect to the features and then estimates its position 100 times a second allowing us to use the control algorithms that I described to you earlier .PERIOD <BREAK>
You will see nine robots play six different instruments .PERIOD <BREAK>
Let's watch .PERIOD <BREAK>
Unless you're on one of these Californian low-carb diets ,COMMA bread is standard .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I think it is because we feel that this kind of bread really is about authenticity .PERIOD <BREAK>
And this is about good taste ,COMMA good traditions .PERIOD <BREAK>
But we have ,COMMA somehow ,COMMA in the course of the last few centuries ,COMMA or even decades ,COMMA started to cultivate an image of a mythical ,COMMA rural agricultural past .PERIOD <BREAK>
So what is happening ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Bread has migrated to tropical countries ,COMMA where the middle classes now eat French rolls and hamburgers and where the commuters find bread much more handy to use than rice or cassava .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is where it all comes from ,COMMA and where these farmers who actually ,COMMA ten thousand years ago ,COMMA put us on the road of bread .PERIOD <BREAK>
Let's go back to traditional farming .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I'm making a real plea here .PERIOD <BREAK>
We've moved towards large-scale and very high control .PERIOD <BREAK>
What I want us to do is to keep up the science and even get more science in there but go to a kind of regional scale -- not just in terms of the scale of the fields ,COMMA but in terms of the entire food network .PERIOD <BREAK>
So what kind of science can we have ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
We cannot solve the world food problem by using biological agriculture .PERIOD <BREAK>
Everything is linked together .PERIOD <BREAK>
Understand that you are part of this enormous chain of events .PERIOD <BREAK>
And as you eat it ,COMMA and as you try it -- please come and stand up .PERIOD <BREAK>
Every meal you eat contains ingredients from all across the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that ,COMMA I think ,COMMA evolutionarily-speaking is unique .PERIOD <BREAK>
And today is a time for me to talk to you about water .PERIOD <BREAK>
This crocodile ,COMMA which grows to almost 20 feet long in the northern rivers ,COMMA and this charismatic snake ,COMMA the king cobra .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it really works to start with them .PERIOD <BREAK>
The people of this part of India worship the king cobra .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's just a wresting match ,COMMA but a remarkable activity .PERIOD <BREAK>
And now the king cobra is a new one .PERIOD <BREAK>
It survived even during the time that the dinosaurs died off .PERIOD <BREAK>
In fact ,COMMA if you see the map ,COMMA the range of their original habitat was all the way from the Indus in Pakistan to the Irrawaddy in Burma .PERIOD <BREAK>
And pretty soon we were seeing sights like this .PERIOD <BREAK>
This was actually just taken last year .PERIOD <BREAK>
My pals in the Crocodile Specialist Group of the IUCN ,COMMA the [Madras Crocodile Bank] ,COMMA an NGO ,COMMA the World Wildlife Fund ,COMMA the Wildlife Institute of India ,COMMA State Forest Departments ,COMMA and the Ministry of Environment ,COMMA we all work together on stuff .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA it seemed that the toxin that was killing the gharial was something in the food chain ,COMMA something in the fish they were eating .PERIOD <BREAK>
But Poolan Devi was one [of them] .PERIOD Which actually Shekhar Kapur made an incredible movie ,COMMA The Bandit Queen ,COMMA which I urge you to see .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA who is next ?QUESTIONMARK Us ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
We've got a lot of a good team of people working up there .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA we can do it .PERIOD <BREAK>
And there is a gharial looking at us from the river .PERIOD <BREAK>
Namaste .PERIOD <BREAK>
I look at it as a creature who is totally frightened of something so dangerous as a human being .PERIOD <BREAK>
You were saying that that hasn't been filmed before .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the guy who is working there with them ,COMMA he's from Maharashtra ,COMMA he said ,COMMA I think he's after the nusha .PERIOD <BREAK>
Whenever he eats the pit viper he gets this little venom rush .PERIOD <BREAK>
To me ,COMMA that’s the real natural wonder .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the insurance companies found that they began to save almost 30000 dollars per patient ,COMMA and Medicare is now in the middle of doing a demonstration project where they’re paying for 1800 people to go through the program on the sites that we train .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I’ll talk more about this ,COMMA but the real epidemic isn’t just heart disease or obesity or smoking -- it’s loneliness and depression .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the pain is not the problem :COLON it’s the symptom .PERIOD <BREAK>
What was the biggest selling drug of all time when it was introduced a few years ago ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
So the very behaviors that we think of as being so sexy in our culture are the very ones that leave so many people feeling tired ,COMMA lethargic ,COMMA depressed and impotent ,COMMA and that’s not much fun .PERIOD <BREAK>
Your sexual function improves .PERIOD <BREAK>
When you eat a big fatty meal ,COMMA how do you feel ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
You feel kind of sleepy afterwards .PERIOD <BREAK>
These are not election returns ;SEMICOLON these are the percentage of people who are overweight .PERIOD <BREAK>
He says ,COMMA I’ve got some good news .PERIOD <BREAK>
What we found was that ,COMMA after a year ,COMMA none of the experimental group patients who made these lifestyle changes needed treatment ,COMMA whereas six of the control-group patients needed surgery or radiation .PERIOD <BREAK>
And then I wondered :COLON was there any relationship between how much people changed their diet and lifestyle -- whichever group they were in -- and the changes in PSA ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
The last thing I want to talk about ,COMMA apropos of the issue of the pursuit of happiness ,COMMA is that study after study have shown that people who are lonely and depressed -- and depression is the other real epidemic in our culture -- are many times more likely to get sick and die prematurely ,COMMA in part because ,COMMA as we talked about ,COMMA they’re more likely to smoke and overeat and drink too much and work too hard and so on .PERIOD <BREAK>
It can be sexual intimacy – I happen to think that healing energy and erotic energy are just different forms of the same thing .PERIOD <BREAK>
And at the end of it ,COMMA somebody said ,COMMA Hey ,COMMA Swami ,COMMA what’s the difference between wellness and illness ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And so he went up on the board and he wrote the word illness ,COMMA and circled the first letter ,COMMA and then wrote the word wellness ,COMMA and circled the first two letters .PERIOD <BREAK>
And along the way they created a breakthrough in computer visualization .PERIOD <BREAK>
Hopefully it won't stutter .PERIOD <BREAK>
And if we did our jobs well ,COMMA you won't know that we were even involved .PERIOD <BREAK>
some you could see ,COMMA some you couldn't .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA there's no use of prosthetic makeup or photography of Brad superimposed over another actor's body .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA Fincher is an interesting guy .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so David had an interesting take on the film ,COMMA and he threw a challenge at us .PERIOD <BREAK>
We went through a process of elimination and a process of discovery with David ,COMMA and we ruled out ,COMMA of course ,COMMA swapping actors .PERIOD <BREAK>
But we used lots of cheats and shortcuts .PERIOD <BREAK>
We really felt like we were in a -- kind of a 12 -step program .PERIOD <BREAK>
And of course ,COMMA the first step is :COLON admit you've got a problem .PERIOD <BREAK>
So we needed a system that would allow Benjamin to do everything a human being can do .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we realized that there was a giant chasm between the state of the art of technology in 2004 and where we needed it to be .PERIOD <BREAK>
The state of the art at the time was something called marker-based motion capture .PERIOD <BREAK>
But we also looked at numbers of other films at the time that were using facial marker tracking ,COMMA and that's the idea of putting markers on the human face and doing the same process .PERIOD <BREAK>
We needed the subtleties of the skin .PERIOD <BREAK>
We needed creases and dimples and wrinkles and all of those things .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA clearly ,COMMA we were in a substantially better place for this .PERIOD <BREAK>
We measure complexity and fidelity of data in terms of polygonal count .PERIOD <BREAK>
This was the breakthrough .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is Brad doing one of the Ekman FACS poses .PERIOD <BREAK>
We shot him with four HD cameras so we'd get multiple views of him and then David would choose the take of Brad being Benjamin that he thought best matched the footage with the rest of the cast .PERIOD <BREAK>
And here you can see the body actor .PERIOD <BREAK>
We also had to create an eye system .PERIOD <BREAK>
He was very popular .PERIOD <BREAK>
There were no animators necessary to come in and interpret behavior or enhance his performance .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA as things went through this process ,COMMA Fincher would always say ,COMMA It sandblasts the edges off of the performance .PERIOD <BREAK>
So it sees a smile as a smile .PERIOD <BREAK>
But we ended up calling the entire process and all the technology emotion capture ,COMMA as opposed to just motion capture .PERIOD <BREAK>
Their teeth are basically bashed out with a metal rod .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we said ,COMMA Okay ,COMMA here is some seed fund .PERIOD <BREAK>
The women were just not allowed to come out of the community and work with mainstream society .PERIOD So ,COMMA we were able to address that .PERIOD <BREAK>
We rescued over 550 dancing bears .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA the end product of that action is up on the board here .PERIOD <BREAK>
When I started talking to Richard about what I was going to speak about ,COMMA I had recently come back from Jordan ,COMMA where I had an amazing experience with a camel .PERIOD <BREAK>
The guys got out ,COMMA they put the hood up ,COMMA they started working under the hood ,COMMA got it going again .PERIOD About a hundred yards ,COMMA it broke down .PERIOD <BREAK>
And they said ,COMMA Ah ,COMMA no problem !EXCLAMATIONMARK We just get out and walk .PERIOD <BREAK>
And they said ,COMMA Yeah ,COMMA yeah ,COMMA we'll walk .PERIOD We'll find some camels .PERIOD <BREAK>
So we'll need to be very careful around him .PERIOD Don't let him get you .PERIOD <BREAK>
When they're in rut -- they're similar to seals in the way ,COMMA like ,COMMA a seal has to open its nose to breathe .PERIOD <BREAK>
They use them to pinpoint sound .PERIOD <BREAK>
The desert's extremely windy as well as being very cold .PERIOD <BREAK>
But they use their tails a lot ,COMMA especially in rut .PERIOD <BREAK>
But on this particular occasion ,COMMA it was very ,COMMA very clear that as horny as Suki was ,COMMA Jasmine was having none of it .PERIOD <BREAK>
So I'm going to show you another film .PERIOD <BREAK>
But before I do ,COMMA I just want to mention that this animal truly is a sort of the SUV of the sand ,COMMA the ship of the desert .PERIOD It's so vital to the inhabitants of the areas in which the camel is found -- largely Mongolia and Sahara -- that there are 160 words in Arabic to describe the camel .PERIOD <BREAK>
And if this is a creature that was designed by committee ,COMMA it's certainly been like no committee I've ever been on .PERIOD <BREAK>
So here's what Suki would do in search of a mate .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'm TED Camel .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'm smartly designed .PERIOD <BREAK>
A distinguished nose ,COMMA with nostrils lined to filter out sand and dust ,COMMA and a groove that catches moisture .PERIOD <BREAK>
Leathery chest pads that beat the heat .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'm able to lose 40 percent of my weight without dying .PERIOD <BREAK>
Humans -- the animal -- are pretty lucky creatures because ,COMMA by and large ,COMMA we really don't have to adapt to our environment ;SEMICOLON we adapt our environment to us .PERIOD <BREAK>
But this creature that you've just seen ultimately adapts ,COMMA and keeps adapting and adapting .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the idea was to have me record some of my poems and then they would find animators to animate them .PERIOD <BREAK>
Writing is not actually as easy as that for me .PERIOD <BREAK>
Poetry just says a few things in different ways .PERIOD <BREAK>
Some days I put the people in their places at the table ,COMMA bend their legs at the knees ,COMMA if they come with that feature ,COMMA and fix them into the tiny wooden chairs .PERIOD <BREAK>
The name of the author is the first to go ,COMMA followed obediently by the title ,COMMA the plot ,COMMA the heartbreaking conclusion ,COMMA the entire novel ,COMMA which suddenly becomes one you have never read ,COMMA never even heard of .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's called The Country .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that to me was a bad start to the afterlife ,COMMA having to witness your own funeral and feel gratified .PERIOD <BREAK>
If it has a subject ,COMMA the subject is adolescence .PERIOD <BREAK>
Frankly ,COMMA who cares if Annie Oakley was a crack shot at 15 or if Maria Callas debuted as Tosca at 17 ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And here comes a second follower .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now it's not a lone nut ,COMMA it's not two nuts -- three is a crowd ,COMMA and a crowd is news .PERIOD <BREAK>
I was listening to all the experts and talking to sort of a board of medical advisers .PERIOD <BREAK>
I wrote the book on a treadmill ,COMMA and it took me about a thousand miles to write the book .PERIOD <BREAK>
I also tried to be the safest person I could be ,COMMA because that's a part of health .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now it's a little extreme ,COMMA I admit .PERIOD <BREAK>
But if you think about this ,COMMA this is actually -- the Freakonomics authors wrote about this -- that more people die on a per mile basis from drunk walking than from drunk driving .PERIOD <BREAK>
Without the sex part .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I finally have stabilized .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I ,COMMA of course ,COMMA don't have time to go into all of them .PERIOD <BREAK>
It really impairs cognition .PERIOD <BREAK>
So without noise reduction technology ,COMMA our country would not exist .PERIOD <BREAK>
And you can almost trick yourself into thinking you're eating Doritos .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's my greatest hope .PERIOD <BREAK>
What might they find ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Here's a replica of one such seal .PERIOD <BREAK>
We need to decipher the script to answer that question .PERIOD <BREAK>
In fact ,COMMA the script has become a battleground of sorts between three different groups of people .PERIOD <BREAK>
If you look at a map of India today ,COMMA you'll see that most of the languages spoken in North India belong to the Indo-European language family .PERIOD <BREAK>
First ,COMMA there's no Rosetta Stone .PERIOD <BREAK>
And furthermore ,COMMA we don't even know what language they spoke .PERIOD <BREAK>
And to make matters even worse ,COMMA most of the text that we have are extremely short .PERIOD <BREAK>
And why was I fascinated ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And I'd like to describe some of the results that we have found .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'll give you a couple of seconds .PERIOD <BREAK>
Languages contain patterns .PERIOD <BREAK>
Language ,COMMA on the other hand ,COMMA has an intermediate level of entropy ;SEMICOLON it's neither too rigid ,COMMA nor is it too random .PERIOD <BREAK>
Here's a graph that plots the entropies of a whole bunch of sequences .PERIOD <BREAK>
We found that the Indus script actually falls within the range of the linguistic scripts .PERIOD <BREAK>
Who'd have thought that deciphering could be a dangerous profession ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
So ,COMMA as the old saying goes ,COMMA if it looks like a linguistic script and it acts like a linguistic script ,COMMA then perhaps we may have a linguistic script on our hands .PERIOD <BREAK>
So as an example ,COMMA here's a word .PERIOD <BREAK>
Okay .PERIOD Great .PERIOD <BREAK>
So this is just like a crossword puzzle ,COMMA except that this is the mother of all crossword puzzles because the stakes are so high if you solve it .PERIOD <BREAK>
It contains seven vertical strokes followed by this fish-like sign .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it turns out that in India there's a long tradition of names being based on horoscopes and star constellations present at the time of birth .PERIOD <BREAK>
Similarly ,COMMA there's another sequence of six stars ,COMMA and that translates to aru meen ,COMMA which is the old Dravidian name for the star constellation Pleiades .PERIOD <BREAK>
So that was pretty exciting .PERIOD <BREAK>
But whilst we have an overwhelmingly vivid visual understanding of space ,COMMA we have no sense of what space sounds like .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now this story doesn't start with vast telescopes or futuristic spacecraft ,COMMA but a rather more humble technology -- and in fact ,COMMA the very medium which gave us the telecommunications revolution that we're all part of today :COLON the telephone .PERIOD <BREAK>
Thomas Watson spent hours listening to the strange crackles and hisses and chirps and whistles that his accidental antenna detected .PERIOD <BREAK>
They turned out to be lightning or sources of electrical power .PERIOD <BREAK>
There was a glitch in their soundtrack .PERIOD <BREAK>
We do enjoy our misery in a certain way .PERIOD <BREAK>
Because our egocentric perception -- from the Buddha's point of view ,COMMA misperception -- is that all we are is what is inside our skin .PERIOD <BREAK>
And everyone here is unfortunately carrying that habitual perception ,COMMA a little bit ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Like ,COMMA even when you're having a good time ,COMMA when is the good time over ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
I think the Dalai Lama should have heard that .PERIOD I wish he'd been there to hear that .PERIOD <BREAK>
Everybody has the wrong idea .PERIOD They think Buddha was so boring ,COMMA and they're so surprised when they meet Dalai Lama and he's fairly jolly .PERIOD <BREAK>
The human being is almost out of time .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is Birhan ,COMMA who was the Ethiopian girl who launched Live Aid in the 1980 s ,COMMA 15 minutes away from death when she was rescued ,COMMA and that picture of her being rescued is one that went round the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
And what do all these pictures and events have in common ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
What they have in common is what we see unlocks what we cannot see .PERIOD <BREAK>
What we see unlocks the invisible ties and bonds of sympathy that bring us together to become a human community .PERIOD <BREAK>
Go back 200 years when the slave trade was under pressure from William Wilberforce and all the protesters .PERIOD <BREAK>
They won public opinion over a long period of time .PERIOD <BREAK>
What could they have done with the pictures that they could have shown if they were able to use the modern means of communication to win people’s hearts and minds ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
I was with Nelson Mandela a year ago ,COMMA when he was in London .PERIOD <BREAK>
I have just been talking to the President of Sierra Leone .PERIOD <BREAK>
I met her in a field ,COMMA she was ragged ,COMMA she had no shoes .PERIOD <BREAK>
We must then build a proper relationship between the richest and the poorest countries based on our desire that they are able to fend for themselves with the investment that is necessary in their agriculture ,COMMA so that Africa is not a net importer of food ,COMMA but an exporter of food .PERIOD <BREAK>
Making people laugh .PERIOD <BREAK>
So please send me your ideas about how to design a foot .PERIOD <BREAK>
We have to first know what a foot is .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I want you to help me do that in this next clip .PERIOD <BREAK>
See any common themes ?QUESTIONMARK Principles ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Now it turns out that animals can go anywhere .PERIOD <BREAK>
If you want to study how a foot works ,COMMA we're going to have to simulate those surfaces ,COMMA or simulate that debris .PERIOD <BREAK>
Without a foot ,COMMA here's what it does .PERIOD It doesn't even slow down .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's a bipedal octopus that's disguised as a rolling coconut .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA you might have noticed something else about the animals when they were running over the rough terrain .PERIOD <BREAK>
Boy :COLON Spiny .PERIOD <BREAK>
Do we really understand that principle of tuning ?QUESTIONMARK The answer is ,COMMA yes !EXCLAMATIONMARK <BREAK>
But look at this animal do it !EXCLAMATIONMARK <BREAK>
And you probably feel them if you grabbed it .PERIOD <BREAK>
These are all from different insects .PERIOD <BREAK>
Let's look at that ant .PERIOD <BREAK>
You see what happens ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
So to our blueprint ,COMMA we stick on some sticky pads .PERIOD <BREAK>
These are its feet .PERIOD <BREAK>
It has a hundred to a thousand split ends ,COMMA and that's the secret ,COMMA because it allows intimate contact .PERIOD <BREAK>
Here you are ,COMMA pulling off the Band-Aid .PERIOD <BREAK>
Here's the new project :COLON we're trying to create the first climbing search-and-rescue robot -- no suction or magnets -- that can only move on limited kinds of surfaces .PERIOD <BREAK>
And here it is coming up at you ,COMMA in its first steps up a wall .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that's exactly what he's done .PERIOD <BREAK>
Thank you .PERIOD <BREAK>
The first thing that got me interested in the sounds of these underwater animals ,COMMA whose world was so foreign to me ,COMMA was evidence from captive dolphins that captive dolphins could imitate human sounds .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is a picture of a trainer's whistle ,COMMA a whistle a trainer will blow to tell a dolphin it's done the right thing and can come get a fish .PERIOD <BREAK>
Many mammals have to produce contact calls when ,COMMA say ,COMMA a mother and calf are apart .PERIOD <BREAK>
What this figure shows is the percentage of the separations in which dolphins whistle ,COMMA against the maximum distance .PERIOD <BREAK>
So when dolphins are separating by less than 20 meters ,COMMA less than half the time they need to use whistles .PERIOD <BREAK>
Most of the time they can just find each other just by swimming around .PERIOD <BREAK>
And two boats :COLON When the second boat was added ,COMMA what happened was that some of the dolphins left the area completely .PERIOD <BREAK>
We may need to regulate the intensity of recreational boating and actual whale watching in order to prevent these kinds of problems .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is a kind of map we've all been looking at .PERIOD <BREAK>
So you're listening to the complicated song produced by humpbacks here .PERIOD <BREAK>
And this orange line here marks the typical songs of east coast humpbacks .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's loud ,COMMA clear -- you can hear it very clearly .PERIOD <BREAK>
But you can still hear that faint call .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is a figure from a textbook on underwater sound .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now think about it .PERIOD This is an amazing thing :COLON That in this frequency range where whales communicate ,COMMA the main source globally ,COMMA on our planet ,COMMA for the noise comes from human ships ,COMMA thousands of human ships ,COMMA distant ,COMMA far away ,COMMA just all aggregating .PERIOD <BREAK>
Same thing in the North Atlantic ,COMMA in the ' 50 s versus 2000 .PERIOD <BREAK>
So we have to be very concerned about when the noise in habitats degrades the habitat enough that the animals either have to pay too much to be able to communicate ,COMMA or are not able to perform critical functions .PERIOD <BREAK>
If you actually insulate and isolate the machinery of the ship from the hull ,COMMA you can reduce that noise by 99 percent .PERIOD <BREAK>
What Maersk did is they worked ways to slow down .PERIOD <BREAK>
And third ,COMMA you can create your own tours -- you can share them with friends ,COMMA you can create them with friends -- and that's the part that I think I'm most excited about because I think that at heart ,COMMA we are all storytellers .PERIOD <BREAK>
Curtis Wong :COLON Thank you ,COMMA Roy .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA Microsoft -- this is a project that -- WorldWide Telescope is dedicated to Jim Gray ,COMMA who's our colleague ,COMMA and a lot of his work that he did is really what makes this project possible .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so ,COMMA what you've seen today is less than a fraction of one percent of what is in here ,COMMA and in the TED Lab ,COMMA we have a tour that was created by a six-year-old named Benjamin that will knock your socks off .PERIOD <BREAK>
Two-thirds of all students in special ed .PERIOD remedial programs are guys .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we're seeing a steady increase among males .PERIOD <BREAK>
They're also totally out of sync in romantic relationships ,COMMA which build gradually and subtly .PERIOD <BREAK>
I can create big things out here ,COMMA but I can go back and really quickly go back to where I started ,COMMA and make even smaller things here .PERIOD <BREAK>
But the neat thing about it is I can add control points .PERIOD <BREAK>
I mean ,COMMA this technique of being able to manipulate a mesh here ,COMMA with multiple control points ,COMMA is actually something that's state of the art .PERIOD <BREAK>
Don't worry .PERIOD <BREAK>
What we don't agree on is what the problem actually is .PERIOD <BREAK>
I think none of these is the problem .PERIOD <BREAK>
We want to go on with our daily life even though we are not living under normal circumstances .PERIOD <BREAK>
In the end ,COMMA Benjamín and Julián decided the best thing they could do was to organize the community and act together .PERIOD <BREAK>
That devotion we feel for the national football team .PERIOD <BREAK>
We need men and women who love Mexico and who are willing to take action .PERIOD <BREAK>
The battle is won ,COMMA but we still have to fight it .PERIOD <BREAK>
Juggling three balls is simple and normal .PERIOD <BREAK>
OK ,COMMA then you've got to combine them ,COMMA because then you have the whole spatial palette in front of you .PERIOD <BREAK>
And then you get crazy .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA I'm actually going to ask you to try something ,COMMA so you've got to pay attention .PERIOD Complexity :COLON if you spend enough time doing something ,COMMA time slows down or your skill increases ,COMMA so your perceptions change .PERIOD <BREAK>
Things slow down as you learn ,COMMA as you learn ,COMMA as you learn .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA complexity .PERIOD Now ,COMMA how many here are jugglers ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
OK ,COMMA so most of you are going to have a similar reaction to this .PERIOD <BREAK>
No ,COMMA it looks like a mess .PERIOD It looks like a mess with a guy there ,COMMA who's got his hands around that mess ,COMMA OK .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's being able to do something that other people can't do or can't understand .PERIOD <BREAK>
All right .PERIOD So ,COMMA that's one way of doing it ,COMMA which is five balls down .PERIOD <BREAK>
Make it wider .PERIOD <BREAK>
Make it narrower .PERIOD <BREAK>
Enough of a clue ?QUESTIONMARK So ,COMMA you get the pattern ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK OK .PERIOD <BREAK>
Pink .PERIOD <BREAK>
So white ball and -- finger ,COMMA finger ,COMMA finger ,COMMA finger ,COMMA finger ,COMMA finger ,COMMA finger ,COMMA finger .PERIOD Pink .PERIOD <BREAK>
Finger ,COMMA finger ,COMMA finger ,COMMA pink or finger .PERIOD <BREAK>
I don't need music for it .PERIOD Talking about time in a moment .PERIOD <BREAK>
Ahhh .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA a moment .PERIOD <BREAK>
OK ?QUESTIONMARK And then ,COMMA what I did as a juggler was say ,COMMA OK ,COMMA what can I do to make that something that is dependent on something else ,COMMA another dynamic .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA a moment .PERIOD <BREAK>
Are we ready to do that ?QUESTIONMARK Yes ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA I'm going to show you the beginnings of a piece that is about balance in some ways ,COMMA and also -- oh ,COMMA actually ,COMMA if you're bored ,COMMA not here ,COMMA here's one use for it .PERIOD <BREAK>
Two Sticks ,COMMA you can go with it .PERIOD Thanks .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's a combination of that ,COMMA the beauty of that ,COMMA the shape ,COMMA and the stories that were involved in it ,COMMA as well as the fact that they protected the contents .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it's going to change as I go through it .PERIOD <BREAK>
I thought it [would] kind of be interesting to think back to that time when Richard got the whole thing started .PERIOD Thank you very much ,COMMA Richard ;SEMICOLON it's been a big ,COMMA enjoyable part of my life ,COMMA coming here .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so it was great fun in those days ,COMMA and some of those of you who are in the audience were my clients .PERIOD <BREAK>
We'd come in with some prototype underneath a black cloth and we'd put it on the conference table ,COMMA and we'd pull off the black cloth and everybody would ooh and ah .PERIOD <BREAK>
That was a really good time .PERIOD <BREAK>
But something's happened in the last 18 years since Richard started TED ,COMMA and that's that people like us -- I know people in other places have caught onto this for a long time ,COMMA but for us ,COMMA we've really just started .PERIOD we've kind of climbed Maslow's hierarchy a little bit -- and so we're now focused more and more on human-centered design ,COMMA human-centeredness in an approach to design .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I think you're starting to see that ,COMMA and it's making our job even more enjoyable .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so in order to do that we've been forming internal video-production groups in order to make these kind of experience prototypes that show just what we mean about the man-machine relationship .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's kind of like architects who show people in their houses ,COMMA as opposed to them being empty .PERIOD <BREAK>
So you can see what you look like from the back or all the way around ,COMMA as you look .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is CBS Sunday Morning that aired about two weeks ago .PERIOD <BREAK>
And my favorite feature ,COMMA which is a flower in a vase that wilts when you leave in disappointment ,COMMA and then when you come back ,COMMA it comes up to greet you ,COMMA happy to see you .PERIOD <BREAK>
The dome has an incredible amount of water that washes off of it ,COMMA as well as wastewater .PERIOD <BREAK>
The pavilion's design goal was to be kind of quiet and peaceful .PERIOD <BREAK>
It can dive to 500 feet ,COMMA to where sunlight does not penetrate ,COMMA and is equipped with powerful lights .PERIOD <BREAK>
(Narrator :COLON And this central box connects the whole system together .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so by doing that ,COMMA the woman that you saw in the first thing -- she's a school teacher -- always wanted to send her kids to college and she's going to be able to do it because of these things .PERIOD <BREAK>
As in this cryptic sentence I found in The Guardian recently :COLON The marriage suffered a setback in 1965 ,COMMA when the husband was killed by the wife .PERIOD <BREAK>
We can't see into the engine room .PERIOD <BREAK>
Electrons disappear in a kind of fuzz ,COMMA and there is only energy .PERIOD And you can't see energy .PERIOD <BREAK>
Not only is she aware of her physical repulsiveness ,COMMA she turns it to her advantage .PERIOD <BREAK>
So he went out and bought a plastic frame to put the photograph in .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA one of the interesting things about invisibility is that things that we can't see we also can't understand .PERIOD <BREAK>
But we can't read each other's minds .PERIOD I find that quite astonishing .PERIOD <BREAK>
But their main exercise of telepathy is to send out powerful signals to the rest of us that it doesn't exist .PERIOD <BREAK>
And this is increasingly peculiar ,COMMA because about 20 years ago ,COMMA when they started delving into the genome ,COMMA they thought it would probably contain around 100000 genes .PERIOD <BREAK>
You can't see these things ,COMMA but they are very strange .PERIOD <BREAK>
Because that's where all the stuff happens that makes you who you are .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is fascinating .PERIOD You probably know ,COMMA some of you ,COMMA that cells are continually renewed .PERIOD You can see it in skin and this kind of stuff .PERIOD <BREAK>
But every cell in your body is replaced at some point .PERIOD <BREAK>
Livers and internal organs sort of take a bit longer .PERIOD A spine takes several years .PERIOD <BREAK>
There is so many things that -- Light .PERIOD <BREAK>
Five out of the 100 billion galaxies ,COMMA with the naked eye ,COMMA and one of them is quite difficult to see unless you've got very good eyesight .PERIOD <BREAK>
What the others are here for ,COMMA I've no idea .PERIOD <BREAK>
So we were thinking ,COMMA well the best way to learn from them is to read all of these millions of books .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now the problem is there's an X-axis for that ,COMMA which is the practical axis .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is extremely practical ,COMMA but not so awesome .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now again ,COMMA we kind of caved in ,COMMA and we did the very practical approach ,COMMA which was a bit less awesome .PERIOD <BREAK>
We said ,COMMA well instead of releasing the full text ,COMMA we're going to release statistics about the books .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's four words ;SEMICOLON we call that a four-gram .PERIOD <BREAK>
Well which one should I use ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
As of about six months ago ,COMMA the state of the art in this field is that you would ,COMMA for instance ,COMMA go up to the following psychologist with fabulous hair ,COMMA and you'd say ,COMMA Steve ,COMMA you're an expert on the irregular verbs .PERIOD <BREAK>
So if you want to become famous early on ,COMMA you should be an actor ,COMMA because then fame starts rising by the end of your 20 s -- you're still young ,COMMA it's really great .PERIOD <BREAK>
One mistake you should not do is become a mathematician .PERIOD <BREAK>
Here's a simple way to do it .PERIOD <BREAK>
So for instance ,COMMA here -- this suppression index is for 5000 people picked in English books where there's no known suppression -- it would be like this ,COMMA basically tightly centered on one .PERIOD <BREAK>
What you expect is basically what you observe .PERIOD <BREAK>
But much more importantly ,COMMA the distribution is much wider .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's the application of massive-scale data collection analysis to the study of human culture .PERIOD <BREAK>
There's various types of frustration .PERIOD <BREAK>
This person studies all the arghs ,COMMA from one through eight A's .PERIOD <BREAK>
These all happen to be on our computers ,COMMA on computers across the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
And when that happens ,COMMA that will transform the way we have to understand our past ,COMMA our present and human culture .PERIOD <BREAK>
One of them is pattern recognition .PERIOD <BREAK>
We listen to differences ,COMMA we discount sounds that remain the same .PERIOD <BREAK>
Why did I say that ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Well there are a lot of reasons for this .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the art of conversation is being replaced -- dangerously ,COMMA I think -- by personal broadcasting .PERIOD <BREAK>
And only without conscious listening can these things happen -- a world where we don't listen to each other at all ,COMMA is a very scary place indeed .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's a great exercise for improving the quality of your listening .PERIOD <BREAK>
So mundane sounds can be really interesting if you pay attention .PERIOD <BREAK>
You can use this in listening ,COMMA in communication .PERIOD <BREAK>
Why is it not taught ?QUESTIONMARK It's crazy .PERIOD <BREAK>
Thank you for listening to me today .PERIOD <BREAK>
So what happened was ,COMMA when I was young and got out of engineering school at Cornell in ' 79 ,COMMA I decided -- I went to work for Intel and I was in the computer industry -- and three months into that ,COMMA I fell in love with something else ,COMMA and I said ,COMMA I made the wrong career choice here ,COMMA and I fell in love with brains .PERIOD <BREAK>
We are in the pre-paradigm days ,COMMA if you want to use Thomas Kuhn .PERIOD <BREAK>
And theory has not played a role in any sort of grand way in the neurosciences .PERIOD <BREAK>
You're more complicated than your brain .PERIOD You've got a brain .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's always been the case .PERIOD And so all we can say ,COMMA well ,COMMA my neocortex ,COMMA which is the part of the brain I'm interested in ,COMMA has 30 billion cells .PERIOD <BREAK>
The best minds were stumped -- really ,COMMA really smart people .PERIOD <BREAK>
It just turns out it's really hard to think of things ,COMMA but once you've thought of them ,COMMA it's kind of easy to understand it .PERIOD <BREAK>
So it was intuitive and obvious .PERIOD Now what about evolution ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And I'm going to work you through this in a few slides here ,COMMA give you an example of what this means .PERIOD Here's a system .PERIOD <BREAK>
And Alan Turing defined the Turing test ,COMMA which is essentially saying ,COMMA we'll know if something's intelligent if it behaves identical to a human .PERIOD <BREAK>
A behavioral metric of what intelligence is ,COMMA and this has stuck in our minds for a long period of time .PERIOD <BREAK>
You're not aware of this ,COMMA but your eyes are always moving .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's not always true ,COMMA but in general ,COMMA there's not a good history of theory in biology .PERIOD <BREAK>
Not like computer memory .PERIOD It's not at all like computer memory .PERIOD <BREAK>
You cannot learn or recall anything outside of a sequence .PERIOD <BREAK>
If you don't build it ,COMMA you don't understand it .PERIOD So ,COMMA one more slide here .PERIOD <BREAK>
The new brain is actually kind of easier than the old brain .PERIOD <BREAK>
But ultimately ,COMMA the world's the limit here .PERIOD <BREAK>
I don't know how this is going to turn out .PERIOD <BREAK>
They couldn't anticipate cell phones and the Internet and all this kind of stuff .PERIOD <BREAK>
I do not think about what I consider to be peace ,COMMA which is sustainable peace with justice and equality .PERIOD <BREAK>
But he's offering 84 billion dollars for the modernizing of nuclear weapons .PERIOD <BREAK>
In global terms ,COMMA it's a little bit of money .PERIOD <BREAK>
But it's going to modernize weapons we do not need and will not be gotten rid of in our lifetime ,COMMA unless we get up off our .PERIOD <BREAK>
I was in Hiroshima a couple of weeks ago ,COMMA and His Holiness -- we're sitting there in front of thousands of people in the city ,COMMA and there were about eight of us Nobel laureates .PERIOD <BREAK>
We're staring at everybody ,COMMA waiting our turn to speak ,COMMA and he leans over to me ,COMMA and he says ,COMMA Jody ,COMMA I'm a Buddhist monk .PERIOD <BREAK>
I spoke with Aung Sun Suu Kyi a couple of days ago .PERIOD <BREAK>
She said ,COMMA You know ,COMMA we have a long road to go to finally get democracy in my country .PERIOD <BREAK>
Here's another woman hero of mine .PERIOD <BREAK>
She says the airports of the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
They call her the Tree Lady ,COMMA but she's more than the Tree Lady .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is Rigoberta Menchu Tum .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's not a dirty word .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's hard work every single day .PERIOD <BREAK>
And then ,COMMA when she closed the door ,COMMA Grandma said ,COMMA No ,COMMA no ,COMMA no ,COMMA no .PERIOD <BREAK>
And they also ,COMMA when they want to travel ,COMMA they use flying machines that can take them to remote destinations .PERIOD <BREAK>
And they want the washing machine .PERIOD <BREAK>
So how come [this is] something that everyone uses and they think others will not stop it ?QUESTIONMARK What is special with this ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And over there they don't even use one each .PERIOD <BREAK>
What are the trends ?QUESTIONMARK If we just prolong the trends ,COMMA without any real advanced analysis ,COMMA to 2050 ,COMMA there are two things that can increase the energy use .PERIOD <BREAK>
And these 22 units -- still the richest people use most of it .PERIOD <BREAK>
They must change behavior in some way .PERIOD <BREAK>
They must also start to produce green energy ,COMMA much more green energy .PERIOD <BREAK>
I was like ,COMMA Okay ,COMMA that's social skill .PERIOD <BREAK>
You go to an elementary school at three in the afternoon and you watch the kids come out ,COMMA and they're wearing these 80 -pound backpacks .PERIOD <BREAK>
Another finding is that the unconscious ,COMMA far from being dumb and sexualized ,COMMA is actually quite smart .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the way you should do that is study the furniture ,COMMA let it marinate in your mind ,COMMA distract yourself ,COMMA and then a few days later ,COMMA go with your gut ,COMMA because unconsciously you've figured it out .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now I'm a middle-aged guy .PERIOD <BREAK>
They put them into a brain scan machine -- this is apocryphal by the way ,COMMA but I don't care -- and they had them watch a horror movie ,COMMA and then they had them describe their feelings toward their wives .PERIOD <BREAK>
They have trouble relating to other people .PERIOD <BREAK>
Ninety-five percent of our professors report that they are above-average teachers .PERIOD <BREAK>
They have epistemological modesty .PERIOD <BREAK>
They are open-minded in the face of ambiguity .PERIOD <BREAK>
The third trait is metis ,COMMA what we might call street smarts -- it's a Greek word .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that comes in tremendously handy ,COMMA because groups are smarter than individuals .PERIOD <BREAK>
What Picasso did ,COMMA for example ,COMMA was take the concept Western art and the concept African masks and blend them together -- not only the geometry ,COMMA but the moral systems entailed in them .PERIOD <BREAK>
And these are skills ,COMMA again ,COMMA we can't count and measure .PERIOD <BREAK>
Just to let you know ,COMMA I do not have a lexicographical whistle .PERIOD <BREAK>
But people think that my job is to let the good words make that difficult left-hand turn into the dictionary ,COMMA and keep the bad words out .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it's not very fun .PERIOD And when parts of your job are not easy or fun ,COMMA you kind of look for an excuse not to do them .PERIOD <BREAK>
But why do people want me to direct traffic ,COMMA when I would much rather go fishing ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Why do I blame the Queen ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
So he's really responsible for a lot of what we consider modern in dictionaries today .PERIOD <BREAK>
I mean ,COMMA I'm a huge geek ,COMMA I love computers .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's steampunk .PERIOD What we have is an electric velocipede .PERIOD <BREAK>
Online dictionaries must be different .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is flat .PERIOD Look how many links there are in the actual entry :COLON two !EXCLAMATIONMARK <BREAK>
So ,COMMA it's not that we have good words and bad words .PERIOD <BREAK>
Some of my best friends are books .PERIOD <BREAK>
How can you say that a sledgehammer is better than a ball-peen hammer ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
So if we're not worrying about directing traffic ,COMMA if we've transcended paper ,COMMA if we are worrying less about control and more about description ,COMMA then we can think of the English language as being this beautiful mobile .PERIOD <BREAK>
If only one out of every 10 of those books had a word that's not in the dictionary in it ,COMMA that would be equivalent to more than two unabridged dictionaries .PERIOD <BREAK>
You know ,COMMA it's pretty to look at for a while ,COMMA but then it dies .PERIOD <BREAK>
We can leave the aesthetic judgments to the writers and the speakers .PERIOD <BREAK>
I was 15 when I was gang-raped by eight men .PERIOD <BREAK>
But the rest ,COMMA who succumb into it ,COMMA go through everyday torture .PERIOD <BREAK>
These are men who buy you for an hour ,COMMA for a day ,COMMA and use you ,COMMA throw you .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we are silent about them .PERIOD <BREAK>
But the extra bonuses that she gets is various infections ,COMMA sexually transmitted infections ,COMMA HIV ,COMMA AIDS ,COMMA syphilis ,COMMA gonorrhea ,COMMA you name it ,COMMA substance abuse ,COMMA drugs ,COMMA everything under the sun .PERIOD <BREAK>
And therefore my challenge was to understand how can I get out the power from this pain .PERIOD <BREAK>
What has been my challenge ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
My biggest challenge is society .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's you and me .PERIOD <BREAK>
But it is not nice to bring them to our homes .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA I'm just going to grab a chair here .PERIOD <BREAK>
I had this company that I'd spent 15 years building .PERIOD It's called Future ;SEMICOLON it was a magazine publishing company .PERIOD <BREAK>
It had recently gone public and the market said that it was apparently worth two billion dollars ,COMMA a number I didn't really understand .PERIOD <BREAK>
The date was February 2000 .PERIOD <BREAK>
I mean ,COMMA it had to .PERIOD Right ?QUESTIONMARK I was in for quite a surprise .PERIOD <BREAK>
I watched my own net worth falling by about a million dollars a day ,COMMA every day ,COMMA for 18 months .PERIOD <BREAK>
Turns out that the research done on that is absolutely mind-blowing .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's the total brain experience ,COMMA we're going to .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA I will .PERIOD Here's the vision for TED .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is a video prototype .PERIOD <BREAK>
And they don't react to background sounds .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we were quite intrigued with playing with the notion of invisibility .PERIOD <BREAK>
Soren enters the room .PERIOD Pop !EXCLAMATIONMARK He goes invisible .PERIOD <BREAK>
So people would walking into the room and they'd almost ignore it ,COMMA thinking it was some crap laying around .PERIOD <BREAK>
So this work is a caricature of an upside-down man .PERIOD <BREAK>
Because if that circle weren't there ,COMMA and the floor was very even ,COMMA it would start to wander about in the space .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's my colleague .PERIOD He's let it go .PERIOD <BREAK>
And if it isn't easily gotten ,COMMA we'll go ahead and steal it .PERIOD <BREAK>
While the carbon dioxide ,COMMA vast quantities of it ,COMMA gigatons ,COMMA goes into the atmosphere where we can't get it back -- yet -- and where it is causing the problems that we're most concerned about .PERIOD <BREAK>
They've run out of good sites .PERIOD <BREAK>
Babcock &amp ;SEMICOLON Wilcox that make nuclear reactors ,COMMA here's an integral fast reactor .PERIOD <BREAK>
CO 2 e emissions are equivalent emissions of all the greenhouse gases and particles that cause warming and converted to CO 2 .PERIOD <BREAK>
We have facilities around there .PERIOD You also have a buffer zone that's 17 square kilometers .PERIOD <BREAK>
And you have the uranium mining that you have to deal with .PERIOD <BREAK>
There are two nations ,COMMA North Korea and Israel ,COMMA that have nuclear weapons and don't have nuclear power at all .PERIOD <BREAK>
There's plenty of solar and wind .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's from real data .PERIOD <BREAK>
Solving the world's problems can be done ,COMMA if you really put your mind to it and use clean ,COMMA renewable energy .PERIOD <BREAK>
And in the United States Senate ,COMMA we need bipartisan support -- only one or two votes are needed -- to move global warming through the Senate ,COMMA and this room can help .PERIOD <BREAK>
The first is :COLON be aware of the propaganda .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I'm ,COMMA you know ,COMMA very much pro that kind of stuff .PERIOD <BREAK>
I campaigned against nuclear weapons in the ' 80 s ,COMMA and I continue to do so now .PERIOD <BREAK>
Because five years from now ,COMMA it will blow you away what we'll actually have as alternatives to this horrible ,COMMA disastrous nuclear power .PERIOD <BREAK>
Your final pitch ,COMMA Stewart .PERIOD <BREAK>
Okay .PERIOD So ,COMMA thank you ,COMMA Mark .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's during our lifetime that we're going to take the Earth ,COMMA take the people of Earth and transition off ,COMMA permanently .PERIOD And that's exciting .PERIOD <BREAK>
In fact ,COMMA I think it is a moral imperative that we open the space frontier .PERIOD <BREAK>
You know ,COMMA it's the first time that we're going to have a chance to have planetary redundancy ,COMMA a chance to ,COMMA if you would ,COMMA back up the biosphere .PERIOD <BREAK>
And if you think about space ,COMMA everything we hold of value on this planet -- metals and minerals and real estate and energy -- is in infinite quantities in space .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we knew nothing about going to space .PERIOD <BREAK>
We went from having literally put Alan Shepard in suborbital flight to going to the moon in eight years ,COMMA and the average age of the people that got us there was 26 years old .PERIOD <BREAK>
The shuttle is costing a billion dollars a launch .PERIOD <BREAK>
As we are going out there and taking on a new frontier ,COMMA we should be allowed to risk .PERIOD <BREAK>
In fact ,COMMA anyone who says we shouldn't ,COMMA you know ,COMMA just needs to be put aside ,COMMA because ,COMMA as we go forward ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA the greatest discoveries we will ever know is ahead of us .PERIOD <BREAK>
And in fact ,COMMA the large corporations ,COMMA the governments ,COMMA can't take the risk .PERIOD <BREAK>
We've got an altitude call of 368000 feet .PERIOD <BREAK>
Today ,COMMA you can go and experience weightless flights .PERIOD <BREAK>
Orbital flights -- we can take you to the space station .PERIOD <BREAK>
That was filmed inside our airplane ,COMMA and so ,COMMA you can now do this .PERIOD <BREAK>
Let me talk about the other thing I'm excited about .PERIOD <BREAK>
It may or may not happen .PERIOD But if you put up a prize ,COMMA the beautiful thing is ,COMMA you know ,COMMA it's a very small maintenance fee ,COMMA and you pay on success .PERIOD <BREAK>
My work is -- it's a reflection of myself .PERIOD <BREAK>
We all seem to think that ,COMMA you know ,COMMA if we look down on the ground ,COMMA there's nothing there .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we use the word nothing .PERIOD <BREAK>
I told her I couldn't face it because the way the teacher was treating me ,COMMA ridiculing me ,COMMA and using me as an example of failure .PERIOD <BREAK>
So I told her .PERIOD <BREAK>
And walked off .PERIOD And I didn't expect that ,COMMA because I expected one of these .PERIOD <BREAK>
So I'm sitting there thinking .PERIOD <BREAK>
So I did .PERIOD <BREAK>
But I thought ,COMMA perhaps the ant won't know ,COMMA it'll probably move in .PERIOD <BREAK>
And then I sat down and all the ants came along .PERIOD <BREAK>
It became part of me .PERIOD <BREAK>
As you can see ,COMMA that's a pinhead .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now that is called the Huf Haus .PERIOD <BREAK>
So I'm thinking ,COMMA Mr .PERIOD Huf isn't going to be very happy when I told him his house has gone to another ,COMMA into the atmosphere somewhere .PERIOD <BREAK>
So to cut the story short ,COMMA I decided that I had to go back and do it .PERIOD <BREAK>
So I found some more .PERIOD And I decided to ,COMMA sort of ,COMMA construct it very ,COMMA very slowly ,COMMA holding my breath ,COMMA working between my heartbeat ,COMMA and making sure everything is leveled .PERIOD <BREAK>
I noticed that the house was occupied .PERIOD <BREAK>
So basically I'd completed the house .PERIOD <BREAK>
So I didn't think he was going to throw Bart off .PERIOD <BREAK>
And sometimes they turn into little catapults and things go up in the air .PERIOD <BREAK>
But I would never do it to a living fly .PERIOD <BREAK>
Even though they get on our nerves ,COMMA I would never kill an insect because ,COMMA All creatures great and small -- there is a hymn that says that .PERIOD <BREAK>
So I have to be very very careful .PERIOD <BREAK>
My work ,COMMA rough estimate ,COMMA sometimes five ,COMMA six to seven weeks ;SEMICOLON you can't always anticipate .PERIOD <BREAK>
As you can see ,COMMA there's an aphid fly there .PERIOD <BREAK>
I remember one time I was doing it ,COMMA and the window was open .PERIOD <BREAK>
And then she looked at me .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I cut off a little flake of gold .PERIOD <BREAK>
Because I had to put the torch on the top .PERIOD <BREAK>
The flag had to be made out of little strands of gold .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's almost like doing a surgical operation to get this thing right .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that was done with a particle from my shirt .PERIOD <BREAK>
My point is here ,COMMA people have a choice -- just like the Indian lady could wear her sari or the Japanese woman could wear her kimono .PERIOD <BREAK>
Which is why I prefer the Richard Wilk analogy of globalizing the local and localizing the global .PERIOD <BREAK>
And therefore tradition becomes more important ,COMMA not less important .PERIOD <BREAK>
We're here ,COMMA we're part of a community ,COMMA sharing out ideas and discussing them .PERIOD <BREAK>
Art becomes a very important part of our national identity .PERIOD <BREAK>
We have done extensive research to ensure that Arab and Muslim artists ,COMMA and Arabs who are not Muslims -- not all Arabs are Muslims ,COMMA by the way -- but we make sure that they are represented in this new institution .PERIOD <BREAK>
For me it was a new discovery .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now visual expression is just one form of culture integration .PERIOD <BREAK>
In a similar way ,COMMA we have created the Doha Film Institute .PERIOD <BREAK>
Who are you playing ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
The Doha Tribeca Film Festival was held at our new cultural hub ,COMMA Katara .PERIOD <BREAK>
I welcome you on board for us to engage and discuss new ideas of how to bring people together through cultural initiatives and discussions .PERIOD <BREAK>
And in a saying of the Koran ,COMMA which to Muslims is God speaking to humanity ,COMMA God says to his prophet Muhammad -- whom we believe to be the last of a series of prophets ,COMMA beginning with Adam ,COMMA including Noah ,COMMA including Moses ,COMMA including Abraham ,COMMA including Jesus Christ ,COMMA and ending with Muhammad -- that ,COMMA We have not sent you ,COMMA O Muhammad ,COMMA except as a 'rahmah' except as a source of compassion to humanity .PERIOD <BREAK>
The esoteric path of Islam is more popularly known as Sufism ,COMMA or tasawwuf in Arabic .PERIOD <BREAK>
The language differs ,COMMA but the objective is the same .PERIOD <BREAK>
And therefore ,COMMA for us to be human -- in the greatest sense of what it means to be human ,COMMA in the most joyful sense of what it means to be human -- means that we too have to be proper stewards of the breath of divinity within us ,COMMA and seek to perfect within ourselves the attribute of being ,COMMA of being alive ,COMMA of beingness ;SEMICOLON the attribute of wisdom ,COMMA of consciousness ,COMMA of awareness ;SEMICOLON and the attribute of being compassionate and loving beings .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I believe ,COMMA personally ,COMMA that we're on the verge and that ,COMMA with the presence and help of people like you here ,COMMA we can bring about the prophecy of Isaiah .PERIOD <BREAK>
My story actually began when I was four years old and my family moved to a new neighborhood in our hometown of Savannah ,COMMA Georgia .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's why they were called ape hangers .PERIOD <BREAK>
And one afternoon ,COMMA I got a call from my doctor .PERIOD <BREAK>
The next day I came to see him .PERIOD I was like ,COMMA Doctor ,COMMA that was a really good joke .PERIOD <BREAK>
I believe my girls will have plenty of opportunities in their lives ,COMMA I wrote these men .PERIOD <BREAK>
Linda ,COMMA my wife ,COMMA joked that it was like having six different marriage proposals .PERIOD <BREAK>
And on that first day we were in this youth hostel in a castle .PERIOD <BREAK>
Will you help be their dad ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And I got to the end -- he was crying and I was crying -- and then he looked at me ,COMMA and he said ,COMMA Yes .PERIOD <BREAK>
And as he talked he had that glint in his eye that I first saw back in Holland -- the glint that says ,COMMA Let's go cow tipping ,COMMA even though we never did tip the cow ,COMMA even though no one tips the cow ,COMMA even though cows don't sleep standing up .PERIOD <BREAK>
And then I had a 15 -hour surgery in which my surgeon ,COMMA Dr .PERIOD John Healey at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Hospital in New York ,COMMA took out my left femur and replaced it with titanium .PERIOD <BREAK>
And anybody who came to see me had to cover themselves in a mask and cover all of the extraneous parts of their body .PERIOD <BREAK>
When my wife and I had kids ,COMMA we thought it would be all-hands-on-deck .PERIOD <BREAK>
Instead ,COMMA it was everybody running the other way .PERIOD <BREAK>
And there was something incredibly profound about sitting down with my closest friends and telling them what they meant to me .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now David is my literary agent .PERIOD <BREAK>
So one day near the end of my journey ,COMMA I said ,COMMA Come on girls ,COMMA let's take a walk across the Brooklyn Bridge .PERIOD <BREAK>
We set out on crutches .PERIOD <BREAK>
And yet ,COMMA for the four million years humans have been walking upright ,COMMA the act is essentially unchanged .PERIOD <BREAK>
As my physical therapist likes to say ,COMMA Every step is a tragedy waiting to happen .PERIOD <BREAK>
You go slow ,COMMA you get where you're going ,COMMA but you get there with this community you built along the way .PERIOD <BREAK>
So I stand here today as you see now ,COMMA walking without crutches or a cane .PERIOD <BREAK>
And last week I had my 18 -month scans .PERIOD <BREAK>
And all the collective minds in this room ,COMMA I dare say ,COMMA can never find a solution for scan-xiety .PERIOD <BREAK>
I feel that I've fitted in ,COMMA in many ways ,COMMA to some of the things that I've heard .PERIOD <BREAK>
They're fighting to develop their own way of living within the forest in a world that's clean ,COMMA a world that isn't contaminated ,COMMA a world that isn't polluted .PERIOD <BREAK>
But ,COMMA of course ,COMMA my real field of expertise lies in an even different kind of civilization -- I can't really call it a civilization .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I propose to bring into this TED conference ,COMMA as I always do around the world ,COMMA the voice of the animal kingdom .PERIOD <BREAK>
The chimps -- there's no time to discuss their fascinating lives -- but they have this long childhood ,COMMA five years of suckling and sleeping with the mother ,COMMA and then another three ,COMMA four or five years of emotional dependence on her ,COMMA even when the next child is born .PERIOD <BREAK>
They can actually live longer than 60 in captivity ,COMMA so we've only done 40 years in the wild so far .PERIOD <BREAK>
We know that chimpanzees and some other creatures can recognize themselves in mirrors -- self as opposed to other .PERIOD <BREAK>
They're disappearing for the reasons that all of you in this room know only too well .PERIOD <BREAK>
And people will pay more for bush-meat ,COMMA as it's called ,COMMA than for domestic meat -- it's culturally preferred .PERIOD <BREAK>
We can talk about the distant past ,COMMA plan for the distant future ,COMMA discuss ideas with each other ,COMMA so that the ideas can grow from the accumulated wisdom of a group .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that's not just in the far-away developing world ;SEMICOLON that's everywhere .PERIOD <BREAK>
Somebody said that yesterday .PERIOD <BREAK>
And Roots and Shoots is a program for hope .PERIOD <BREAK>
See the brick walls as all the problems that we've inflicted on this planet .PERIOD <BREAK>
It isn't something that their parents tell them ,COMMA or their teachers tell them .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's effective ,COMMA but if they decide themselves ,COMMA We want to clean this river and put the fish back that used to be there .PERIOD <BREAK>
No violence ,COMMA no bombs ,COMMA no guns .PERIOD <BREAK>
How many more minutes ?QUESTIONMARK Two ,COMMA one ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And it's been so clear how much you all care about trying to make this world a better place .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's very encouraging .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we've talked a lot about that .PERIOD <BREAK>
And then as I went around the country after that and felt the fear -- the fear that was leading to people feeling they couldn't worry about the environment any more ,COMMA in case they seemed not to be patriotic -- and I was trying to encourage them ,COMMA somebody came up with a little quotation from Mahatma Gandhi ,COMMA If you look back through human history ,COMMA you see that every evil regime has been overcome by good .PERIOD <BREAK>
And just after that a woman brought me this little bell ,COMMA and I want to end on this note .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's in our hands .PERIOD <BREAK>
If we lead lives where we consciously leave the lightest possible ecological footprints ,COMMA if we buy the things that are ethical for us to buy and don't buy the things that are not ,COMMA we can change the world overnight .PERIOD <BREAK>
In the laboratory what we want to do is much the same ,COMMA but with on the order of tens of different types of molecules -- so a drastic reduction in complexity ,COMMA but still trying to produce something that looks lifelike .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is how we can start to make a protocell .PERIOD <BREAK>
As you know ,COMMA when you put oil and water together ,COMMA they don't mix ,COMMA but through self-assembly we can get a nice oil droplet to form ,COMMA and we can actually use this as a body for our artificial organism or for our protocell ,COMMA as you will see later .PERIOD <BREAK>
This structure ,COMMA then ,COMMA can organize the formation of a membrane boundary around itself ,COMMA so it can make a body of liquid molecules around itself ,COMMA and that's shown in green here on this micrograph .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's actually quite lifeless .PERIOD Once it forms ,COMMA it doesn't really do anything .PERIOD <BREAK>
So some things that are missing is ,COMMA for example ,COMMA if you had a flow of energy through a system ,COMMA what we'd want is a protocell that can harvest some of that energy in order to maintain itself ,COMMA much like living systems do .PERIOD <BREAK>
So I add some food source to the system .PERIOD <BREAK>
So then we put these protocells together in a single experiment to see what they would do ,COMMA and depending on the conditions ,COMMA we have some protocells on the left that are moving around and it likes to touch the other structures in its environment .PERIOD <BREAK>
So then I repeated this experiment a bunch of times ,COMMA and one time something very interesting happened .PERIOD <BREAK>
So since we can make some interesting protocells that we like ,COMMA interesting colors and interesting behaviors ,COMMA and they're very easy to make ,COMMA and they have interesting lifelike properties ,COMMA perhaps these protocells have something to tell us about the origin of life on the Earth .PERIOD Perhaps these represent an easily accessible step ,COMMA one of the first steps by which life got started on the early Earth .PERIOD <BREAK>
They look really good ,COMMA very nice movement ,COMMA and also they appear to have some kind of behavior where they kind of circle around each other and follow each other ,COMMA similar to what we've seen before -- but again ,COMMA working with just primordial conditions ,COMMA no pure chemicals .PERIOD <BREAK>
They're even better models of environmental health ,COMMA because not only the same mammalian biology ,COMMA but they share your diet ,COMMA largely .PERIOD <BREAK>
So they drank as much vodka as they did plain water ,COMMA which was interesting .PERIOD <BREAK>
I just want to say it was sort of a rule of thumb though ,COMMA there's about two or three fire hydrants on every city block .PERIOD <BREAK>
They flatten a few plants .PERIOD No big deal ,COMMA they'll regenerate .PERIOD <BREAK>
That 99 percent of the time when a firetruck is not parking there ,COMMA it's infiltrating pollutants .PERIOD <BREAK>
So these are small actions that can amount to a significant effect to improve local environmental health .PERIOD <BREAK>
Here's one of them that we have up now .PERIOD <BREAK>
When a fish swims underneath ,COMMA a light goes on .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is what it looks like .PERIOD <BREAK>
So there's another function on here .PERIOD <BREAK>
And they text back .PERIOD <BREAK>
In this case ,COMMA instead of throwing chewing gum ,COMMA or Doritos or whatever you have in your pocket at the fish -- There's a body of water in Iceland that I've been dealing with that's in the middle of the city ,COMMA and the largest pollution burden on it is not the roadborne pollution ,COMMA it's actually white bread from people feeding the fish and the birds .PERIOD <BREAK>
They're cross-species delicious that is ,COMMA delicious for humans and non-humans .PERIOD <BREAK>
And you say ,COMMA boy ,COMMA that's a lot .PERIOD <BREAK>
But you know what ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA if you parked those end to end and wrapped them around the Earth ,COMMA that would stretch around the Earth 125 times .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we wanted to take advantage of Moore's Law with electronic controls and software ,COMMA and we absolutely wanted our car to be connected .PERIOD <BREAK>
So let me talk about hydrogen first .PERIOD <BREAK>
The beauty of hydrogen is it can come from so many different sources :COLON it can come from fossil fuels ,COMMA it can come from any way that you can create electricity ,COMMA including renewables .PERIOD <BREAK>
And hydrogen and fuel cells give us that opportunity to actually use our cars and trucks when they're parked to generate electricity for the grid .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we talked about swarm networks earlier .PERIOD <BREAK>
Actually the theme of this conference ,COMMA I think ,COMMA has hit on really one of the major keys to pull that off -- and that's relationships and working together .PERIOD <BREAK>
I just want to ask one .PERIOD <BREAK>
We're into this over a billion dollars already ,COMMA so I would hope people would think we're serious when we're spending that kind of money .PERIOD <BREAK>
In Oxford ,COMMA perhaps we can use Lewis Carroll and look in the looking glass that is New York City to try and see our true selves ,COMMA or perhaps pass through to another world .PERIOD <BREAK>
My colleagues and I have been working for 10 years to rediscover this lost world in a project we call The Mannahatta Project .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I'd like to tell you the story in three acts ,COMMA and if I have time still ,COMMA an epilogue .PERIOD <BREAK>
It was once a beach .PERIOD And this painting has John James Audubon ,COMMA the painter ,COMMA sitting on the rock .PERIOD <BREAK>
Or this painting ,COMMA from the 1740 s ,COMMA from Greenwich Village .PERIOD <BREAK>
Here's Bowling Green .PERIOD And here's Broadway .PERIOD <BREAK>
And just beyond it you can see features that have vanished ,COMMA things that have disappeared .PERIOD <BREAK>
Or Murray Hill .PERIOD And this is the Murrays' house on Murray Hill ,COMMA 200 years ago .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I thought to myself ,COMMA You know ,COMMA if I could georeference this map ,COMMA if I could place this map in the grid of the city today ,COMMA I could find these lost features of the city ,COMMA in the block-by-block geography that people know ,COMMA the geography of where people go to work ,COMMA and where they go to live ,COMMA and where they like to eat .PERIOD <BREAK>
Then ,COMMA if we added maps like the geology ,COMMA the bedrock geology ,COMMA and the surface geology ,COMMA what the glaciers leave ,COMMA if we make the soil map ,COMMA with the 17 soil classes ,COMMA that are defined by the National Conservation Service ,COMMA if we make a digital elevation model of the topography that tells us how high the hills were ,COMMA then we can calculate the slopes .PERIOD <BREAK>
We can calculate the aspect .PERIOD <BREAK>
The white areas on this map are the places protected from the winter winds .PERIOD <BREAK>
We compiled all the information about where the Native Americans were ,COMMA the Lenape .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the old fields ,COMMA the successional fields that go .PERIOD <BREAK>
It was really an extraordinary landscape that was capable of supporting an extraordinary biodiversity .PERIOD <BREAK>
As if these were the maps that we would need to predict where you would find the beaver .PERIOD <BREAK>
An aspen needs fire and dry soils .PERIOD <BREAK>
But what are the conditions that make it possible ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And these would be the kind of trees that might have been there ,COMMA and the flowers and the lichens and the mosses ,COMMA the butterflies ,COMMA the fish in the stream ,COMMA the birds in the trees .PERIOD <BREAK>
And perhaps a black bear walked by .PERIOD And maybe Native Americans were there .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we used it to try and reveal a landscape here in Act III .PERIOD <BREAK>
We can see the fields that the Native Americans made .PERIOD <BREAK>
So when you're watching Law and Order ,COMMA and the lawyers walk up the steps they could have walked back down those steps of the New York Court House ,COMMA right into the Collect Pond ,COMMA 400 years ago .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I think this is what we're learning about building cities in the future .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is the particular additional habitat requirement of humanity .PERIOD <BREAK>
Fill in the blanks .PERIOD <BREAK>
Unfortunately ,COMMA while this society is ,COMMA without a doubt ,COMMA the most prosperous and dynamic the world has ever created ,COMMA it's got some major ,COMMA major flaws .PERIOD <BREAK>
Clearly we don't have 10 planets .PERIOD <BREAK>
And they may not want to live exactly like us .PERIOD <BREAK>
You know ,COMMA so on the one hand we have the unthinkable ;SEMICOLON on the other hand we have the unimaginable .PERIOD <BREAK>
You know ,COMMA what we're out there doing is looking for examples of tools ,COMMA models and ideas ,COMMA which ,COMMA if widely adopted ,COMMA would change the game .PERIOD <BREAK>
Here ,COMMA for example ,COMMA is Vancouver ,COMMA which if you haven't been there ,COMMA you ought to go for a visit .PERIOD It's a fabulous city .PERIOD <BREAK>
But once you also have people living in close proximity to each other ,COMMA one of the things you can do is -- as information technologies develop -- you can start to have smart places .PERIOD <BREAK>
They live in the emerging megacities of the developing world .PERIOD <BREAK>
All throughout the developing world ,COMMA people are going directly to cell phones ,COMMA skipping the whole landline stage .PERIOD <BREAK>
When you have free ability for people to freely work together and innovate ,COMMA you get different kinds of solutions .PERIOD <BREAK>
And those solutions are accessible in a different way to people who don't have capital .PERIOD Right ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
It's doing something new .PERIOD There's new things happening .PERIOD <BREAK>
You have other radical examples where the ability to use cultural tools is spreading out .PERIOD <BREAK>
Another world is possible .PERIOD <BREAK>
We tweak that a lot .PERIOD <BREAK>
We're looking a lot at this .PERIOD This is spreading everywhere .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is from A Force More Powerful .PERIOD It's a little screenshot .PERIOD <BREAK>
These are refrigerators that require no electricity ;SEMICOLON they're pot within a pot design .PERIOD <BREAK>
How do we help people like that ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Audience :COLON It detects landmines .PERIOD <BREAK>
If you are living in one of the places where the roughly half-billion unaccounted for mines are scattered ,COMMA you can fling these seeds out into the field .PERIOD <BREAK>
And policing copyright violations for children's birthday cakes was such a hassle that the College Bakery said ,COMMA You know what ,COMMA we're getting out of that business .PERIOD <BREAK>
If you're an amateur ,COMMA you don't have access to our machine anymore .PERIOD <BREAK>
So the policing layer around the problem becomes the real threat of the act .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the back story is this :COLON SOPA and PIPA ,COMMA as legislation ,COMMA were drafted largely by media companies that were founded in the 20 th century .PERIOD <BREAK>
And Congress did something .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that law was called the Audio Home Recording Act of 1992 .PERIOD <BREAK>
So when the Audio Home Recording Act of 1992 was passed ,COMMA the media businesses gave up on the idea of legal versus illegal distinctions for copying because it was clear that if Congress was acting in their framework ,COMMA they might actually increase the rights of citizens to participate in our own media environment .PERIOD <BREAK>
It was a complicated piece of legislation ,COMMA a lot of moving parts .PERIOD <BREAK>
That is a side effect of their ordinary operation .PERIOD <BREAK>
Every DVD player and game player and television and computer you brought home -- no matter what you thought you were getting when you bought it -- could be broken by the content industries ,COMMA if they wanted to set that as a condition of selling you the content .PERIOD <BREAK>
So this is the Internet they have in mind .PERIOD <BREAK>
Imagine it says TED ,COMMA because the comments can't be policed at any acceptable cost .PERIOD <BREAK>
And if you're not an American citizen ,COMMA you can contact American citizens that you know and encourage them to do the same .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the DMCA goes back to the Audio Home Recording Act ,COMMA which horrified those industries .PERIOD <BREAK>
They just want the sharing to go away .PERIOD <BREAK>
The whole world is laid out for you ,COMMA the best jobs are laid out for you ,COMMA and you want to go and work in a village ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
What the poor thought was important would be reflected in the college .PERIOD <BREAK>
You failed in your exam ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
The education system in India makes you look at Paris and New Delhi and Zurich ;SEMICOLON what are you doing in this village ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
You have to have a dignity of labor .PERIOD <BREAK>
A traditional midwife is a professional .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it's the only college where we don't give a certificate .PERIOD <BREAK>
So when I said that ,COMMA they said ,COMMA Well show us what is possible .PERIOD What are you doing ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
The men should clear out because we don't want to share this technology with the men .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's the only college which is fully solar-electrified .PERIOD <BREAK>
So long as the sun shines ,COMMA we'll have no problem with power .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we have 60 meals twice a day of solar cooking .PERIOD <BREAK>
She looks after 20 goats in the morning ,COMMA but she's prime minister in the evening .PERIOD <BREAK>
Wasn't dazzled at all by what was happening .PERIOD <BREAK>
Where the percentage of illiteracy is very high ,COMMA we use puppetry .PERIOD <BREAK>
Why ?QUESTIONMARK Because they want to leave the village and go to a city ,COMMA looking for a job .PERIOD <BREAK>
Comes back ,COMMA goes into the village ,COMMA says ,COMMA Well what's the story ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
They said ,COMMA These two grandmothers .PERIOD Grandmothers ?QUESTIONMARK The minister couldn't believe what was happening .PERIOD <BREAK>
Went straight to the president .PERIOD <BREAK>
So he summoned me and said ,COMMA Can you train me 150 grandmothers ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
I said ,COMMA Yeah ,COMMA she is very beautiful .PERIOD <BREAK>
And when I went back six months later ,COMMA I said ,COMMA Where's your husband ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Don't listen to the World Bank ,COMMA listen to the people on the ground .PERIOD <BREAK>
Our scientist colleagues are finding new patterns in the information .PERIOD <BREAK>
For artists ,COMMA we're making new worlds that we can uncover and explore .PERIOD <BREAK>
The white dots are the probability wave that will show you where the electron is in any given point of time and space in this particular three-orbital configuration .PERIOD <BREAK>
What kind of remarkable machinery does this guy have in his head ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
A system of cognitive processes ,COMMA largely non-conscious cognitive processes ,COMMA that help them change their views of the world ,COMMA so that they can feel better about the worlds in which they find themselves .PERIOD <BREAK>
Who are these characters who are so damn happy ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Some of you are old enough to remember :COLON he was the chairman of the House of Representatives and he resigned in disgrace when this young Republican named Newt Gingrich found out about a shady book deal he had done .PERIOD <BREAK>
So he went to find them .PERIOD They said ,COMMA We can give you a franchise on this for 3000 bucks .PERIOD <BREAK>
And finally :COLON never ever join the Beatles .PERIOD <BREAK>
In this case ,COMMA because the experiment I'm going to tell you about uses them ,COMMA these are Monet prints .PERIOD <BREAK>
We did this experiment with a group of patients who had anterograde amnesia .PERIOD These are hospitalized patients .PERIOD <BREAK>
We then gave them the choice between number three and number four .PERIOD <BREAK>
Really ,COMMA Jim ,COMMA you don't remember ?QUESTIONMARK I was just here with the Monet prints ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Free ?QUESTIONMARK Aren't you just giving me my own paper ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
What are you doing ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
They don't like their picture ,COMMA and in fact even after the opportunity to swap has expired ,COMMA they still don't like their picture .PERIOD Why ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
We could do it so that when you take the two pictures ,COMMA you'd have four days to change your mind ,COMMA or we're doing another course where you take the two pictures and you make up your mind right away and you can never change it .PERIOD Which course would you like to be in ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Let me parenthetically pause here and tell you -- Esther ,COMMA my mother ,COMMA had stopped driving several years ago ,COMMA to the collective relief of the entire city of Atlanta .PERIOD <BREAK>
There's a historical marker .PERIOD <BREAK>
I guess I must .PERIOD <BREAK>
Oh ,COMMA Jesus .PERIOD <BREAK>
Puts it in reverse .PERIOD Fifty-five out of the driveway ,COMMA in reverse .PERIOD <BREAK>
I've got a white-knuckle grip on the door .PERIOD You know what I'm talking about ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And there she goes ,COMMA right .PERIOD <BREAK>
OK ,COMMA so I stopped at a light and there's a guy ,COMMA you know ,COMMA in the back .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA you have all been at a mall during the holidays ,COMMA yes ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
It will upset you .PERIOD <BREAK>
Look ,COMMA the Chevy -- he's coming this way .PERIOD <BREAK>
How many of you once in your -- you were a kid ,COMMA you were an adult -- you stood in a parking space to hold it for someone ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Of course ,COMMA her comeback is ,COMMA When have I embarrassed you ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
A brevity ,COMMA brevity of everything with this child .PERIOD <BREAK>
But she pauses occasionally and says ,COMMA How do you spell that ?QUESTIONMARK What year ?QUESTIONMARK OK .PERIOD <BREAK>
When she writes the expose in about 20 years ,COMMA don't believe a word of it .PERIOD <BREAK>
But this is my daughter ,COMMA Lauren ,COMMA my remarkable daughter ,COMMA my borderline Asperger's kid .PERIOD <BREAK>
She says ,COMMA Ma ,COMMA you got to look !EXCLAMATIONMARK <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA when this kid says I got to look ,COMMA you know .PERIOD <BREAK>
Oh ,COMMA Jesus .PERIOD Oh ,COMMA Jesus .PERIOD <BREAK>
I finally come -- and now ,COMMA it's the South .PERIOD <BREAK>
We want to curl up and say ,COMMA Tell it to me ,COMMA tell it to me .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'm with the little lady .PERIOD Damn !EXCLAMATIONMARK <BREAK>
After I say -- let me refresh you -- have you no shame ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
With her is a young man -- husband ,COMMA brother ,COMMA lover ,COMMA it's not my job .PERIOD <BREAK>
They turn then ,COMMA shoulder to shoulder ,COMMA and walk away ,COMMA lost in their own reverie .PERIOD <BREAK>
And they use motors that literally are used on cruise missile boosters .PERIOD <BREAK>
Voices :COLON Woohoo !EXCLAMATIONMARK Yeah .PERIOD Nice .PERIOD <BREAK>
What are catastrophic effects ?QUESTIONMARK A three degree centigrade climate change rise that will result in 50 percent species extinction .PERIOD <BREAK>
But now I'll talk about some more pleasant things .PERIOD <BREAK>
How fabulous .PERIOD Why would you ever want to go by yourself in your own car ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Where can I go today and who can I do it with ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
It's when you charge a premium for people to drive on congested roads .PERIOD <BREAK>
In London ,COMMA the day they turned the congestion pricing on ,COMMA there was a 25 percent decrease in congestion overnight ,COMMA and that's persisted for the four years in which they've been doing congestion pricing .PERIOD <BREAK>
You weren't going to put tollbooths around the city of London and open and shut those gates .PERIOD <BREAK>
And road pricing is where we're all going to have to go ,COMMA because today we pay for our maintenance and wear and tear on our cars with gas taxes .PERIOD <BREAK>
And if we have it ,COMMA you'll decide how many miles to drive ,COMMA what mode of travel ,COMMA where to live and work .PERIOD <BREAK>
Again ,COMMA all mesh-enabled .PERIOD Monthly communication cost :COLON zero .PERIOD <BREAK>
They're resilient ;SEMICOLON their redundancy is built into this fabulous decentralized design .PERIOD <BREAK>
These things are going to happen .PERIOD <BREAK>
Maybe we shouldn't wait for the 10 or 15 years for this to happen .PERIOD <BREAK>
And if I had my druthers ,COMMA we would have an open-source version in addition to open standards .PERIOD <BREAK>
When I went this morning to Larry Brilliant's TEDTalk prize -- his fabulous networks -- imagine if there was an open-source mesh communications device that can be put into those networks ,COMMA to make all that happen .PERIOD <BREAK>
So the Awesome story :COLON It begins about 40 years ago ,COMMA when my mom and my dad came to Canada .PERIOD <BREAK>
My dad left a small village outside of Amritsar ,COMMA India .PERIOD <BREAK>
And they got here in the late 1960 s .PERIOD <BREAK>
We grew up taking for granted a lot of the things that my parents couldn't take for granted when they grew up -- things like power always on in our houses ,COMMA things like schools across the street and hospitals down the road and popsicles in the backyard .PERIOD <BREAK>
So you can't actually see them ,COMMA but it was breathtaking ,COMMA believe me .PERIOD <BREAK>
My marriage wasn't going well ,COMMA and we just were growing further and further apart .PERIOD <BREAK>
One day my wife came home from work and summoned the courage ,COMMA through a lot of tears ,COMMA to have a very honest conversation .PERIOD <BREAK>
And as these dark clouds were circling me ,COMMA and I was finding it really ,COMMA really difficult to think of anything good ,COMMA I said to myself that I really needed a way to focus on the positive somehow .PERIOD <BREAK>
And nobody read it except for my mom .PERIOD <BREAK>
Flash-forward to the next year and The Book of Awesome has now been number one on the bestseller list for 20 straight weeks .PERIOD <BREAK>
But look ,COMMA I said I wanted to do three things with you today .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's sad ,COMMA and it's not pleasant to talk about ,COMMA but your husband might leave you ,COMMA your girlfriend could cheat ,COMMA your headaches might be more serious than you thought ,COMMA or your dog could get hit by a car on the street .PERIOD <BREAK>
And there are times in life when you will be tossed in the well ,COMMA too ,COMMA with twists in your stomach and with holes in your heart ,COMMA and when that bad news washes over you ,COMMA and when that pain sponges and soaks in ,COMMA I just really hope you feel like you've always got two choices .PERIOD <BREAK>
Because you all used to be three years old .PERIOD <BREAK>
That three-year-old girl is still part of you .PERIOD <BREAK>
These were four guys on the LA .PERIOD Rams in the 1960 s you did not want to go up against .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'd like to pause my TEDTalk for about 10 seconds right now ,COMMA because you don't get many opportunities in life to do something like this ,COMMA and my parents are sitting in the front row .PERIOD <BREAK>
He would say ,COMMA Look ,COMMA can you believe they have a mango here from Mexico ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
You can sleep in clean sheets .PERIOD <BREAK>
The cashiers at your grocery store ,COMMA the foreman at your plant ,COMMA the guy tailgating you home on the highway ,COMMA the telemarketer calling you during dinner ,COMMA every teacher you've ever had ,COMMA everyone that's ever woken up beside you ,COMMA every politician in every country ,COMMA every actor in every movie ,COMMA every single person in your family ,COMMA everyone you love ,COMMA everyone in this room and you will be dead in a hundred years .PERIOD <BREAK>
Thank you .PERIOD <BREAK>
Dan Rather :COLON Since the September 11 th attack on the World Trade Center ,COMMA many people have flocked to downtown New York to see and pay respects at what amounts to the 16 -acre burial ground .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA as CBS's Jim Axelrod reports ,COMMA they're putting the finishing touches on a new way for people to visit and view the scene .PERIOD <BREAK>
There's a new place in New York where the crowds are thickest -- Ground Zero .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is ours .PERIOD <BREAK>
David Rockwell :COLON The first experience people will have here when they see this is not as a construction site but as this incredibly moving burial ground .PERIOD <BREAK>
The walls are bare by design ,COMMA so people can fill them with their own memorials the way they already have along the current perimeter .PERIOD <BREAK>
Your work is highly sensual ,COMMA even hedonistic .PERIOD <BREAK>
But I've got to tell you -- it became impossible to do that .PERIOD <BREAK>
We were really paralyzed .PERIOD <BREAK>
And in discussing this with other architects ,COMMA we had seen people saying in the press that they should rebuild the towers as they were -- they should rebuild them 50 stories taller .PERIOD <BREAK>
It was predominantly a white ,COMMA rich ,COMMA corporate group that was not representative of the city .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I think this was the 21 st ,COMMA and we knew this had to be built and up by the 28 th .PERIOD <BREAK>
In fact ,COMMA it was as if this was going to be window-washing scaffolding .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I've got to say that we spent a lot of time in putting this together ,COMMA watching the crowds that gathered at Saint Paul -- which is just to the right -- and moving around the site .PERIOD <BREAK>
No .PERIOD In fact I told the contractor to go ahead .PERIOD <BREAK>
I think this is ,COMMA obviously ,COMMA substantially different from anything we'd ever thought about doing before ,COMMA just by the nature of it .PERIOD <BREAK>
Well ,COMMA I think one thing that shouldn't be done is evaluate -- I think right now the discussion is a very closed discussion on the master plan .PERIOD <BREAK>
I don't think it has much to do with 50 or 60 or 70 or 80 thousand new office spaces ,COMMA regardless of what the number is .PERIOD <BREAK>
And in fact ,COMMA there's a proposal on the table now for building number seven .PERIOD <BREAK>
Right ,COMMA which the towers fell into .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the reason that's been held up is essentially by community outrage that they're not re-opening the street to connect that back to the rest of the city .PERIOD <BREAK>
This small foundation we put together is looking for other ways to help .PERIOD <BREAK>
So I thought that would be good to end with .PERIOD <BREAK>
One of the tricky issues we had with the Giuliani administration was I had forgotten how anti-graffiti he was .PERIOD <BREAK>
And essentially our structure was designed to be written on .PERIOD <BREAK>
As you say ,COMMA it's not a memorial .PERIOD <BREAK>
But the kind of virtually instantaneous nature of its erection ,COMMA and its being there ,COMMA almost before you could believe that a response of this magnitude could be accomplished ,COMMA is part of its extraordinary -- I don't know if beauty is the word -- but presence .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA a funny thing happened on my way to becoming a brilliant ,COMMA world-class neuropsychologist :COLON I had a baby .PERIOD <BREAK>
Sorry ,COMMA TED .PERIOD <BREAK>
Because this is what I do .PERIOD This is what I teach .PERIOD <BREAK>
So look to the right-hand side of the screen .PERIOD <BREAK>
Would it be crazy to know ,COMMA 103 Gs .PERIOD <BREAK>
How do we know that legislation that would require that they be pulled from play ,COMMA cleared for return to play ,COMMA applies to them ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
If ,COMMA God forbid ,COMMA any of us left here tonight and sustained a concussion ,COMMA most of us would go on to fully recover inside of a couple hours to a couple of weeks .PERIOD <BREAK>
Should your kid play football ?QUESTIONMARK I don't know .PERIOD <BREAK>
The first :COLON study up .PERIOD <BREAK>
We've just rolled this out in the last couple months -- CO Kids With Brain Injury .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now I thought that it was because I have this totally compelling helmet crusade ,COMMA right ,COMMA this epiphany of Tom's .PERIOD <BREAK>
Thank you .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is but one :COLON this is Frank Gehry the architect's precursor to the Guggenheim in Abu Dhabi .PERIOD <BREAK>
So my first topic with respect to this ,COMMA was not death ,COMMA but obesity .PERIOD <BREAK>
So this is a slide of some of our initial results .PERIOD <BREAK>
How big are the clusters ?QUESTIONMARK How far do they reach ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
This here shows ,COMMA on the Y-axis ,COMMA the increase in the probability that a person is obese given that a social contact of theirs is obese and ,COMMA on the X-axis ,COMMA the degrees of separation between the two people .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the next bar over ,COMMA the [red] line ,COMMA says if your friend's friends are obese ,COMMA your risk of obesity is 25 percent higher .PERIOD <BREAK>
There are at least three possibilities :COLON One possibility is that ,COMMA as I gain weight ,COMMA it causes you to gain weight .PERIOD <BREAK>
Another more subtle possibility is that they start gaining weight ,COMMA and it changes your ideas of what an acceptable body size is .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA I want to be very clear :COLON We do not think our work should or could justify prejudice against people of one or another body size at all .PERIOD <BREAK>
And ,COMMA by the end ,COMMA you're going to see clusters of obese and non-obese individuals within the network .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so this function of emotions suggests that ,COMMA in addition to any other purpose they serve ,COMMA they're a kind of primitive form of communication .PERIOD <BREAK>
And whether you become happy or not depends in part on whether you occupy a happy patch .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA this work with emotions ,COMMA which are so fundamental ,COMMA then got us to thinking about :COLON Maybe the fundamental causes of human social networks are somehow encoded in our genes .PERIOD <BREAK>
Well ,COMMA the striking patterns of human social networks ,COMMA their ubiquity and their apparent purpose beg questions about whether we evolved to have human social networks in the first place ,COMMA and whether we evolved to form networks with a particular structure .PERIOD <BREAK>
And ,COMMA finally ,COMMA compare nodes C and D :COLON C and D both have six friends .PERIOD <BREAK>
But now we ,COMMA with a bird's eye view looking at this network ,COMMA can see that they occupy very different social worlds .PERIOD <BREAK>
So different structural locations have different implications for your life .PERIOD <BREAK>
They are a kind of social capital .PERIOD <BREAK>
New properties emerge because of our embeddedness in social networks ,COMMA and these properties inhere in the structure of the networks ,COMMA not just in the individuals within them .PERIOD <BREAK>
They're both made of carbon ,COMMA and yet one of them has carbon atoms in it that are arranged in one particular way -- on the left -- and you get graphite ,COMMA which is soft and dark .PERIOD <BREAK>
If I was always violent towards you or gave you misinformation or made you sad or infected you with deadly germs ,COMMA you would cut the ties to me ,COMMA and the network would disintegrate .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'd never seen anything like that .PERIOD <BREAK>
But after seeing what I've seen ,COMMA the truth is ,COMMA they have not disappeared at all .PERIOD <BREAK>
And this is happening every day .PERIOD <BREAK>
And from these bedrooms and living rooms and garages ,COMMA with cheap webcams ,COMMA lies the world's great dancers of tomorrow .PERIOD <BREAK>
And you let it go ,COMMA and then right when you see the tail ,COMMA you grab it by the tail ,COMMA then you bring it back in .PERIOD <BREAK>
You know ,COMMA you create power ,COMMA then you tame it .PERIOD <BREAK>
According to the treaty ,COMMA those lands are a sovereign nation .PERIOD <BREAK>
1868 :COLON The second Fort Laramie Treaty clearly guarantees the sovereignty of the Great Sioux Nation and the Lakotas' ownership of the sacred Black Hills .PERIOD <BREAK>
A new agreement was presented to Sioux chiefs and their leading men under a campaign known as sell or starve :COLON Sign the paper ,COMMA or no food for your tribe .PERIOD <BREAK>
Reservations are cut up into 160 -acre sections and distributed to individual Indians with the surplus disposed of .PERIOD <BREAK>
Tribes lost millions of acres .PERIOD <BREAK>
To this day ,COMMA this is the most Medals of Honor ever awarded for a single battle .PERIOD <BREAK>
Unemployment on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation fluctuates between 85 and 90 percent .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is how we came to own these United States .PERIOD <BREAK>
And how much of this history do you need to own ,COMMA even ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Because the solution seems so far in the past ,COMMA I needed nothing short of a time machine to access them .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's why there's a glass of water up there .PERIOD <BREAK>
This solution has been called ,COMMA by some ,COMMA potentially the most important medical advance this century .PERIOD <BREAK>
And what it was was oral rehydration salts .PERIOD <BREAK>
Maybe there's a biological answer .PERIOD <BREAK>
See ,COMMA we spent a lot of energy ,COMMA in many domains -- technological ,COMMA scientific ,COMMA hard work ,COMMA creativity ,COMMA human ingenuity -- to crack important social problems with technology solutions .PERIOD <BREAK>
Here I have a bunch of other examples ,COMMA all suffer from the last mile problem .PERIOD <BREAK>
The last mile is ,COMMA everywhere ,COMMA problematic .PERIOD <BREAK>
The problem is this little three-pound machine that's behind your eyes and between your ears .PERIOD <BREAK>
They do lots of inconsistent things .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA diarrhea's interesting because it's been around for thousands of years ,COMMA ever since humankind really lived side by side enough to have really polluted water .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA think of the mental model that goes behind reducing the intake .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA here you all are ,COMMA ostensibly educated people .PERIOD <BREAK>
Most of you look smart .PERIOD <BREAK>
I think we've learned the answer to that here .PERIOD <BREAK>
Almost out of kindergarten .PERIOD <BREAK>
These models ,COMMA like the leaky bucket ,COMMA work well in most situations .PERIOD <BREAK>
They are situations where the mental model doesn't match the reality .PERIOD <BREAK>
So now ,COMMA while you're thinking about that let's move to a second task .PERIOD <BREAK>
Fifty versus 35 ,COMMA that's a big move .PERIOD Eleven versus nine ?QUESTIONMARK Come on .PERIOD <BREAK>
So far ,COMMA I've been pretty negative .PERIOD <BREAK>
You just gotta carry this thing around .PERIOD <BREAK>
Here's another example of this .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is from a company called Positive Energy .PERIOD <BREAK>
And what they find is just this letter ,COMMA nothing else ,COMMA has a two to three percent reduction in electricity use .PERIOD <BREAK>
We have testing ,COMMA we go to the lab ,COMMA we try it again ,COMMA we have refinement .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA this whole area is so fascinating .PERIOD <BREAK>
How you take your insights here and actually get them integrated into working business models on the ground ,COMMA in Indian villages ,COMMA for example ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
We work closely with companies that have operational capacity ,COMMA or nonprofits that have operational capacity .PERIOD <BREAK>
If you have biological problems we try and fix it ,COMMA see if it works ,COMMA and then work the scale .PERIOD <BREAK>
When the magazine -- actually ,COMMA when I got the subscription -- it was 12 following pages .PERIOD <BREAK>
If it's -- see it for a long enough time ,COMMA I actually do something about it .PERIOD <BREAK>
Thank you so much .PERIOD <BREAK>
Well now if I take that sugar dough ,COMMA the sugar dough doesn't want to conduct electricity .PERIOD <BREAK>
We call this our sushi circuit .PERIOD It's very popular with kids .PERIOD <BREAK>
I plug in again the power to it .PERIOD <BREAK>
I can start plugging in lots of lights .PERIOD <BREAK>
We've got some videos .PERIOD You can make them yourselves .PERIOD <BREAK>
We've had a mom in Utah who used them with her kids ,COMMA to a science researcher in the UK ,COMMA and curriculum developers in Hawaii .PERIOD <BREAK>
Up ,COMMA don't move the wrist .PERIOD Over the heart ,COMMA don't move the wrist .PERIOD <BREAK>
And then look at me .PERIOD <BREAK>
Good .PERIOD Nice .PERIOD And you can sit over there .PERIOD <BREAK>
Which one shall have a good poker hand ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
This guy beats them with four of a kind ,COMMA or deuce -- deuce .PERIOD <BREAK>
No reaction ?QUESTIONMARK That with even -- OK ,COMMA and this .PERIOD <BREAK>
These look in order ,COMMA I'm probably -- hopefully -- yeah .PERIOD Three ,COMMA four ,COMMA five ,COMMA six ,COMMA seven and .PERIOD <BREAK>
Such life .PERIOD Right ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA if you are interested ,COMMA I will demonstrate some underground techniques .PERIOD <BREAK>
Right ?QUESTIONMARK You agree .PERIOD <BREAK>
OK .PERIOD <BREAK>
So -- because if you look ,COMMA now ,COMMA I can still see it .PERIOD <BREAK>
Come to -- no ,COMMA no ,COMMA no ,COMMA no .PERIOD <BREAK>
When I'm sober ,COMMA I do this much quicker ,COMMA but we will check .PERIOD <BREAK>
Pardon ?QUESTIONMARK But then ,COMMA when we will have it back ,COMMA you do this .PERIOD <BREAK>
Perfect .PERIOD <BREAK>
Please name any card ,COMMA anyone .PERIOD <BREAK>
My fault .PERIOD Don't applaud ,COMMA this was clubs .PERIOD <BREAK>
But now I do it the regular speed ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Excellent .PERIOD <BREAK>
and queen of hearts .PERIOD Yes !EXCLAMATIONMARK <BREAK>
So ,COMMA now a false count .PERIOD <BREAK>
Right ,COMMA sorry ,COMMA my -- I should have mentioned that ,COMMA yeah .PERIOD <BREAK>
Yeah ,COMMA good .PERIOD <BREAK>
I liked it .PERIOD Now ,COMMA a little more difficult .PERIOD <BREAK>
You see ,COMMA I don't work with prestige ,COMMA so always do mistakes .PERIOD <BREAK>
One ,COMMA two ,COMMA three ,COMMA four -- yes ,COMMA the camera got it ?QUESTIONMARK Five ,COMMA six ,COMMA seven ,COMMA eight -- ah -- nine ,COMMA 10 ,COMMA the jack ,COMMA jack of spades ,COMMA queen of -- I like that laugh ,COMMA yeah !EXCLAMATIONMARK Good .PERIOD Queen .PERIOD <BREAK>
There was the place .PERIOD And here is king of spades ,COMMA correct ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Ah ,COMMA this is tough .PERIOD <BREAK>
Maybe it's important -- yeah -- nine of diamonds ,COMMA OK .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I give you a diamonds ,COMMA so they -- so you put them here ,COMMA in a nice row ,COMMA right .PERIOD And you can see ,COMMA yeah ?QUESTIONMARK Good .PERIOD <BREAK>
You're peeking .PERIOD You just got to -- this is a request from the lady in the back .PERIOD <BREAK>
We will try .PERIOD <BREAK>
And there are some of us who think you ain't seen nothing yet .PERIOD <BREAK>
I see some of you recognize this child .PERIOD <BREAK>
At that point ,COMMA they usually give up .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the 10 -year-old ,COMMA on every eight notes .PERIOD <BREAK>
It can be the other buttock .PERIOD <BREAK>
These are the people who never listen to classical music .PERIOD <BREAK>
You couldn't tell the difference between somebody from Texas and somebody from Rome .PERIOD <BREAK>
Of course ,COMMA I'm not sure they'll be up to it .PERIOD <BREAK>
Do you know what I think probably happened in this room ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And for the rest of your life ,COMMA every time you hear classical music ,COMMA you'll always be able to know if you hear those impulses .PERIOD <BREAK>
Do you remember Hamlet ?QUESTIONMARK Act one ,COMMA scene three ,COMMA he finds out that his uncle killed his father .PERIOD <BREAK>
No ,COMMA otherwise the play would be over ,COMMA stupid .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA he tries the E again .PERIOD That chord doesn't work .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I've one last request before I play this piece all the way through .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I did exactly what I did with you ,COMMA and I told them and explained them and the whole thing .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA how would you walk -- because you know ,COMMA my profession ,COMMA the music profession doesn't see it that way .PERIOD <BREAK>
People in my orchestra came up to me and said ,COMMA Ben ,COMMA what happened ?QUESTIONMARK That's what happened .PERIOD <BREAK>
Who am I being ,COMMA that my children's eyes are not shining ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
I learned this from a woman who survived Auschwitz ,COMMA one of the rare survivors .PERIOD <BREAK>
And she told me this ,COMMA she said ,COMMA We were in the train going to Auschwitz ,COMMA and I looked down and saw my brother's shoes were missing .PERIOD <BREAK>
Thank you .PERIOD <BREAK>
Here's what he did .PERIOD He gathered his participants .PERIOD <BREAK>
If you're the fastest of everyone we're testing here today ,COMMA you get 20 dollars .PERIOD <BREAK>
But for a lot of tasks ,COMMA they actually either don't work or ,COMMA often ,COMMA they do harm .PERIOD <BREAK>
If you look at the science ,COMMA there is a mismatch between what science knows and what business does .PERIOD <BREAK>
But for 21 st century tasks ,COMMA that mechanistic ,COMMA reward-and-punishment approach doesn't work ,COMMA often doesn't work ,COMMA and often does harm .PERIOD <BREAK>
Same deal .PERIOD You :COLON we're timing for norms .PERIOD <BREAK>
Low-cost providers around the world can do it cheaper .PERIOD <BREAK>
The rules are mystifying .PERIOD <BREAK>
Okay ?QUESTIONMARK But one the task called for even rudimentary cognitive skill ,COMMA a larger reward led to poorer performance .PERIOD <BREAK>
People offered the medium level of rewards did no better than people offered the small rewards .PERIOD <BREAK>
In eight of the nine tasks we examined across three experiments ,COMMA higher incentives led to worse performance .PERIOD <BREAK>
Last month ,COMMA just last month ,COMMA economists at LSE looked at 51 studies of pay-for-performance plans ,COMMA inside of companies .PERIOD <BREAK>
There is a mismatch between what science knows and what business does .PERIOD <BREAK>
Purpose :COLON the yearning to do what we do in the service of something larger than ourselves .PERIOD <BREAK>
Traditional notions of management are great if you want compliance .PERIOD <BREAK>
A few times a year they tell their engineers ,COMMA Go for the next 24 hours and work on anything you want ,COMMA as long as it's not part of your regular job .PERIOD <BREAK>
And then ,COMMA being Australians ,COMMA everybody has a beer .PERIOD <BREAK>
That one day of intense autonomy has produced a whole array of software fixes that might never have existed .PERIOD <BREAK>
They have autonomy over their time ,COMMA their task ,COMMA their team ,COMMA their technique .PERIOD <BREAK>
Autonomy ,COMMA mastery and purpose ,COMMA versus carrot and sticks .PERIOD And who wins ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Three :COLON The secret to high performance isn't rewards and punishments ,COMMA but that unseen intrinsic drive -- the drive to do things for their own sake .PERIOD <BREAK>
So this ,COMMA again ,COMMA is on the subject -- a slice from the equator of the Earth .PERIOD <BREAK>
It turns once per day in synchrony with the Earth .PERIOD <BREAK>
This would be grown ,COMMA I suppose ,COMMA with nanotechnology in the future sometime .PERIOD <BREAK>
So if we could roll the next film here .PERIOD <BREAK>
This has evolved over the years in a lot of different iterations .PERIOD <BREAK>
The idea of this air genie is ,COMMA it's something that can just transform and become anything .PERIOD <BREAK>
And then it would have a corresponding website that would show the itinerary of this .PERIOD <BREAK>
Um ,COMMA he was happy .PERIOD <BREAK>
Let's see somebody else ,COMMA a great conductor .PERIOD <BREAK>
He's a nice guy .PERIOD He's a really nice guy .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's not true .PERIOD When he was a young man of about 30 ,COMMA he wrote what he called The Ten Commandments for Conductors .PERIOD <BREAK>
The first one was :COLON If you sweat by the end of the concert it means that you must have done something wrong .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA either he is senile ,COMMA and doesn't remember his own music ,COMMA because he wrote the music .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA no ,COMMA he doesn't want that .PERIOD That's a different kind of control .PERIOD <BREAK>
Once like a Muti ,COMMA and you'll -- -- clap ,COMMA just once .PERIOD <BREAK>
And then like Karajan .PERIOD Let's see what happens .PERIOD Okay ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And when Karajan is asked about it he actually says ,COMMA Yes ,COMMA the worst damage I can do to my orchestra is to give them a clear instruction .PERIOD <BREAK>
Well ,COMMA it is different .PERIOD But isn't that controlling in the same way ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Look at the eyes .PERIOD <BREAK>
And you're playing a painful sound .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now it's a reversed thing .PERIOD You're telling the story .PERIOD And you're telling the story .PERIOD <BREAK>
But all my work for many years was focused around the idea that sustainability means basically looking at the globalized economic growth model ,COMMA and moderating what comes in at one end ,COMMA and moderating the outputs at the other end .PERIOD <BREAK>
If you could help me with that it would be fantastic .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's open source .PERIOD It's something which everybody who's involved with it develops and passes on as they work with it .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's self-organizing .PERIOD There is no great central organization that pushes this ;SEMICOLON people just pick up an idea and they run with it ,COMMA and they implement it where they are .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it's really about how systems ,COMMA settlements ,COMMA withstand shock from the outside .PERIOD <BREAK>
When our supermarkets have only two or three days' worth of food in them at any one time ,COMMA often sustainability tends to focus on the energy efficiency of the freezers and on the packaging that the lettuces are wrapped up in .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's a process which is playful and creative and informative .PERIOD <BREAK>
And there are thousands of others who are at what we call the mulling stage .PERIOD <BREAK>
A lot of places are working with their local schools .PERIOD <BREAK>
And also starting to play around with the idea of alternative currencies .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we see it all over the place as well now .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is probably the most boring topic of the whole morning .PERIOD <BREAK>
Many of the people involved have special interests or short-term interests that get them not thinking about what the implications of the trends are .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now how did we get here ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
They make you pay more in withholding just to help their cash flow out .PERIOD <BREAK>
And California's not unique .PERIOD <BREAK>
There's ways ,COMMA if it's temporary ,COMMA to minimize the impact ,COMMA but it's a problem .PERIOD <BREAK>
Well you have to allocate dollars for that system and for that incentive pay .PERIOD <BREAK>
Well there really is no brain trust .PERIOD <BREAK>
So what do we need to do ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Whenever they say there's these long-term problems ,COMMA we can't say ,COMMA Oh ,COMMA you're the messenger with bad news ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Now I think this is a solvable problem .PERIOD <BREAK>
What do I know that would cause me ,COMMA a reticent ,COMMA Midwestern scientist ,COMMA to get myself arrested in front of the White House protesting ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Did it mean that Venus had an ionosphere ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And it was kept hot by a thick carbon dioxide atmosphere .PERIOD <BREAK>
Its changes will affect all of humanity .PERIOD <BREAK>
British physicist John Tyndall ,COMMA in the 1850 's ,COMMA made laboratory measurements of the infrared radiation ,COMMA which is heat .PERIOD <BREAK>
Most of the things mentioned in our 1981 paper were facts .PERIOD <BREAK>
I had the privilege to speak twice to the president's climate task force .PERIOD <BREAK>
Let me describe the most important conclusion from the physics -- first ,COMMA from Earth's energy balance and ,COMMA second ,COMMA from Earth's climate history .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now finally ,COMMA we can measure Earth's energy imbalance precisely by measuring the heat content in Earth's heat reservoirs .PERIOD <BREAK>
The biggest reservoir ,COMMA the ocean ,COMMA was the least well measured ,COMMA until more than 3000 Argo floats were distributed around the world's ocean .PERIOD <BREAK>
Yet ,COMMA there was more energy coming in than going out .PERIOD <BREAK>
These curves for global temperature ,COMMA atmospheric CO 2 and sea level were derived from ocean cores and Antarctic ice cores ,COMMA from ocean sediments and snowflakes that piled up year after year over 800000 years forming a two-mile thick ice sheet .PERIOD <BREAK>
And more CO 2 causes more warming .PERIOD <BREAK>
So CO 2 ,COMMA methane ,COMMA and ice sheets were feedbacks that amplified global temperature change causing these ancient climate oscillations to be huge ,COMMA even though the climate change was initiated by a very weak forcing .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the rate has accelerated since the measurements began nine years ago .PERIOD <BREAK>
Ice sheets would continue to disintegrate for centuries .PERIOD <BREAK>
What may be more reprehensible ,COMMA if climate denial continues ,COMMA is extermination of species .PERIOD <BREAK>
An important impact ,COMMA if global warming continues ,COMMA will be on the breadbasket of our nation and the world ,COMMA the Midwest and Great Plains ,COMMA which are expected to become prone to extreme droughts ,COMMA worse than the Dust Bowl ,COMMA within just a few decades ,COMMA if we let global warming continue .PERIOD <BREAK>
I need your help to communicate the gravity and the urgency of this situation and its solutions more effectively .PERIOD <BREAK>
A parachute jump from the very edge of space .PERIOD <BREAK>
What I'd like to do first is take you through a very brief helicopter ride of stunts and the stunts industry in the movies and in television ,COMMA and show you how technology has started to interface with the physical skills of the stunt performer in a way that makes the stunts bigger and actually makes them safer than they've ever been before .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'm a stunt coordinator .PERIOD And as well as perform stunts I often design them .PERIOD <BREAK>
What safety they had was very scant .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is the first stunt woman ,COMMA Rosie Venger ,COMMA an amazing woman .PERIOD <BREAK>
Yakima Canutt really formed the stunt fight .PERIOD <BREAK>
Talking of dangerous stunts and bringing things slightly up to date ,COMMA some of the most dangerous stunts we do as stunt people are fire stunts .PERIOD <BREAK>
Well ,COMMA we used to use trampettes .PERIOD In the old days ,COMMA that's all they had .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that's a ramp .PERIOD Spring off the thing and fly through the air ,COMMA and hopefully you make it look good .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now we've got technology .PERIOD This thing is called an air ram .PERIOD <BREAK>
Rolling a car over is another area where we use technology .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's a long way to fall ,COMMA if you get it wrong .PERIOD That was just about right .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is a shot of Terminator ,COMMA the movie .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's 30 feet .PERIOD It's water .PERIOD It's very simple .PERIOD <BREAK>
This guy is not skydiving .PERIOD He's being flown like a kite ,COMMA or moved around like a kite .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's that shape because the helium has to expand .PERIOD <BREAK>
Certainly at 100000 feet no aircraft will fly .PERIOD <BREAK>
We will have two balloons for each of my test jumps ,COMMA and two balloons for the main jump ,COMMA because they notoriously tear on takeoff .PERIOD <BREAK>
A drogue chute is just a smaller chute which helps to keep your face down .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's hundreds of feet high .PERIOD It's enormous .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's a three sided box ,COMMA basically .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's the prototype of the parachute .PERIOD I've now had them custom make one ,COMMA the only one of its kind in the world .PERIOD And that's the only suit of its kind in the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
Then they're comfortable ,COMMA they have good vision ,COMMA like this great big visor .PERIOD <BREAK>
And then if the cabin depressurizes while the aircraft is coming back down ,COMMA in whatever emergency measures ,COMMA everyone is okay .PERIOD <BREAK>
But if you are ,COMMA and you say to somebody ,COMMA you know ,COMMA they say ,COMMA What do you do ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Like religion ,COMMA and money and other things .PERIOD <BREAK>
What you have there is a person of extraordinary dedication who found a talent .PERIOD And my contention is ,COMMA all kids have tremendous talents .PERIOD <BREAK>
Thank you very much .PERIOD So ,COMMA 15 minutes left .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the girl said ,COMMA I'm drawing a picture of God .PERIOD <BREAK>
He was in the Nativity play .PERIOD <BREAK>
You may have seen it :COLON Nativity II .PERIOD But James got the part of Joseph ,COMMA which we were thrilled about .PERIOD <BREAK>
We had the place crammed full of agents in T-shirts :COLON James Robinson IS Joseph !EXCLAMATIONMARK <BREAK>
Anyway ,COMMA the three boys came in -- four-year-olds with tea towels on their heads -- and they put these boxes down ,COMMA and the first boy said ,COMMA I bring you gold .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the third boy said ,COMMA Frank sent this .PERIOD <BREAK>
They have become frightened of being wrong .PERIOD <BREAK>
So why is this ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
You don't think of Shakespeare having a father ,COMMA do you ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Shakespeare being seven ?QUESTIONMARK I never thought of it .PERIOD I mean ,COMMA he was seven at some point .PERIOD He was in somebody's English class ,COMMA wasn't he ?QUESTIONMARK How annoying would that be ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And stop speaking like that .PERIOD It's confusing everybody .PERIOD <BREAK>

I grew up at a time when iconic actors from Kuwait ,COMMA Syria ,COMMA Egypt used laughter to unite the region ,COMMA just as football can .PERIOD <BREAK>
Also ,COMMA three guys working for years in Los Angeles ,COMMA an Iranian ,COMMA a Palestinian and an Egyptian ,COMMA created the aptly named Axis of Evil comedy act .PERIOD <BREAK>
who had started a successful new tribe .PERIOD <BREAK>
I invited our new CEO ,COMMA and as soon as he realized we had a room packed full of laughing infidels ,COMMA his reaction was very simple :COLON Let's make this happen .PERIOD <BREAK>
Stay away from bolitics in the Middle East .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA were the Axis successful ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Anywhere you go .PERIOD <BREAK>
We're not all angry fanatics who want to kill the infidel .PERIOD <BREAK>
For inspiration ,COMMA go to one of our festivals ,COMMA go online ,COMMA drop us a line .PERIOD <BREAK>
As my father likes to call him ,COMMA Asheikh Azubare ;SEMICOLON as my mother would say ,COMMA Shakespeare .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I'm not a trained academic .PERIOD <BREAK>
It was very difficult not to get scared ,COMMA not to get daunted .PERIOD <BREAK>
We want to take one child at a time and take the child right through school ,COMMA sent to college ,COMMA and get them prepared for better living ,COMMA a high value job .PERIOD <BREAK>
That was our first school .PERIOD One hundred sixty-five children .PERIOD <BREAK>
But they know there is this myth that children from the slums cannot speak English well .PERIOD <BREAK>
Even if it takes me four and a half hours ,COMMA or three and half hours to finish my book ,COMMA I do it .PERIOD <BREAK>
We have to send the fathers to de-addiction labs and when they come back ,COMMA most times sober ,COMMA we have to find a job for them so that they don't regress .PERIOD <BREAK>
Art ,COMMA music are considered therapy and mediums of expression .PERIOD <BREAK>
We didn't hire McKinsey to do a business plan .PERIOD <BREAK>
He comes for a tummy rub ,COMMA because he believes that will give me luck .PERIOD <BREAK>
I promise you ,COMMA Parusharam will speak in the TED conference a few years from now .PERIOD <BREAK>
I think I was supposed to talk about my new book ,COMMA which is called Blink ,COMMA and it's about snap judgments and first impressions .PERIOD <BREAK>
So I decided instead ,COMMA I would talk about someone who I think has done as much to make Americans happy as perhaps anyone over the last 20 years ,COMMA a man who is a great personal hero of mine :COLON someone by the name of Howard Moskowitz ,COMMA who is most famous for reinventing spaghetti sauce .PERIOD <BREAK>
And one of his first clients was -- this is many years ago ,COMMA back in the early ' 70 s -- one of his first clients was Pepsi .PERIOD <BREAK>
We'd like you to figure out how much aspartame we should put in each can of Diet Pepsi ,COMMA in order to have the perfect drink .PERIOD Right ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And he would think it through and say ,COMMA what was wrong ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Why could we not make sense of this experiment with Diet Pepsi ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
This was his horseradish .PERIOD He was obsessed with it !EXCLAMATIONMARK <BREAK>
You'd have a plate of spaghetti ,COMMA and you would pour it on ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And of those three facts ,COMMA the third one was the most significant ,COMMA because at the time ,COMMA in the early 1980 s ,COMMA if you went to a supermarket ,COMMA you would not find extra-chunky spaghetti sauce .PERIOD <BREAK>
And Prego turned to Howard ,COMMA and they said ,COMMA You telling me that one third of Americans crave extra-chunky spaghetti sauce and yet no one is servicing their needs ?QUESTIONMARK And he said yes !EXCLAMATIONMARK <BREAK>
It's a mystery !EXCLAMATIONMARK <BREAK>
What percentage of you actually like a dark ,COMMA rich ,COMMA hearty roast ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
A mustard of more sophistication and culture and meaning .PERIOD <BREAK>
There is no perfect mustard or imperfect mustard .PERIOD <BREAK>
And where did that come from ?QUESTIONMARK It came from Italy .PERIOD <BREAK>
When we talked about authentic tomato sauce in the 1970 s ,COMMA we talked about Italian tomato sauce .PERIOD We talked about the earliest ragus ,COMMA which had no visible solids ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Because we thought that what it took to make people happy was to provide them with the most culturally authentic tomato sauce ,COMMA A ;SEMICOLON and B ,COMMA we thought that if we gave them the culturally authentic tomato sauce ,COMMA then they would embrace it .PERIOD <BREAK>
I guess my cancer different from your cancer .PERIOD <BREAK>
And for that ,COMMA we owe him a great vote of thanks .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the example he used was coffee .PERIOD <BREAK>
But to us he was just Dad ,COMMA and our home life was pretty normal .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I think a lot of people in his day probably thought he was a bit of a kook .PERIOD <BREAK>
Or even the people who actually pulled it off ,COMMA the people at Bolt ,COMMA Beranek and Newman in Boston ,COMMA who just would sketch out these structures of what would eventually become a worldwide network ,COMMA and sketching things on the back of napkins and on note papers and arguing over dinner at Howard Johnson's -- on Route 128 in Lexington ,COMMA Massachusetts ,COMMA just two miles from where I was studying the Queen's Gambit Deferred and listening to Gladys Knight &amp ;SEMICOLON the Pips singing Midnight Train to Georgia ,COMMA while -- -- in my dad's big easy chair ,COMMA you know ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Another one which believes in the pure transparency of content .PERIOD <BREAK>
These are four very different ways of looking at the world .PERIOD I even gave them names .PERIOD <BREAK>
And there's also a balance between the visible and the invisible in comics .PERIOD <BREAK>
This was even before the Web .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so ,COMMA what they would do is ,COMMA they'd have these comic pages that resemble print comics pages ,COMMA and they would introduce all this sound and motion .PERIOD <BREAK>
The distance from Abraham Lincoln to a Lincoln penny ,COMMA the Penny Marshall to the Marshall Plan to Plan 9 to nine lives :COLON it's all the same .PERIOD <BREAK>
So I had all these notions .PERIOD This was back in the late ' 90 s ,COMMA and other people in my business thought I was pretty crazy ,COMMA but a lot of people then went on and actually did it .PERIOD <BREAK>
I just want to get to the last panel .PERIOD <BREAK>

And as great as these books were ,COMMA you could always tell that you were getting close to the full effect .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that's when I discovered comedy .PERIOD <BREAK>
It takes the base metal of our conventional wisdom and transforms it through ridicule into a different way of seeing and ultimately being in the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
Because that's what I take from the theme of this conference :COLON Gained in Translation .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now I'm big on speaking to people's self-interest because we're all wired for that .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now that's honesty and integrity ,COMMA and it's also why Fey's performances left such a lasting impression .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now whether this says more about the conflict between integrity and profitability of corporate journalism than it does about the attentiveness of Stewart's viewers ,COMMA the larger point remains that Stewart's material is always grounded in a commitment to the facts -- not because his intent is to inform .PERIOD It's not .PERIOD <BREAK>
His intent is to be funny .PERIOD <BREAK>
And just like that ,COMMA you've been seduced into a different way of looking at something because the endorphins have brought down your defenses .PERIOD <BREAK>
Because from what I can tell ,COMMA the three things gay Americans seem to want most are to join the military ,COMMA get married and start a family .PERIOD <BREAK>
Economy of language is another real strong suit of great comedy .PERIOD <BREAK>
How about that ?QUESTIONMARK How about we create a better world for nothing ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And not long after that ,COMMA he got another request for a copy from the head of the EPA in California who used it as part of her presentation at an international conference on climate change in Sacramento last year .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I think that if you're not ,COMMA there's probably something inherently wrong with the structure or the situation you're in ,COMMA if you're a designer .PERIOD <BREAK>
Being serious is hard .PERIOD <BREAK>
Serious design ,COMMA serious play ,COMMA is something else .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA I always saw design careers like surreal staircases .PERIOD <BREAK>
And as you get older and more decrepit ,COMMA you sort of inch along on this sort of depressing ,COMMA long staircase ,COMMA leading you into oblivion .PERIOD <BREAK>
There's a Paul Newman movie that I love called The Verdict .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is the case .PERIOD There are no other cases .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that is a wonderful position to be in to create some serious play .PERIOD <BREAK>
There was no format .PERIOD <BREAK>
I lived and breathed it in a way I haven't with a client since .PERIOD <BREAK>
It enabled me to really express myself and grow .PERIOD <BREAK>
But something happened to it ,COMMA and what happened to it was ,COMMA it became very popular .PERIOD <BREAK>
Here's an ad in the New York Times somebody did for a play called Mind Games .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'd never done this kind of work before .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is Symphony Space on 90 th Street and Broadway ,COMMA and the type is interwoven into the stainless steel and backlit with fiber optics .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it was serious play .PERIOD <BREAK>
They got into it -- they took the job incredibly seriously .PERIOD <BREAK>
But it became the end of the seriousness of the play ,COMMA and it started to ,COMMA once again ,COMMA become solemn .PERIOD <BREAK>
And then I spent a year going to long ,COMMA tedious ,COMMA boring meetings ,COMMA trying to sell this logo through to a huge corporation to the point of tears .PERIOD <BREAK>
Here's the United States .PERIOD <BREAK>
And there are some brilliant linguists ,COMMA mostly Russians ,COMMA who are working on that ,COMMA at Santa Fe Institute and in Moscow ,COMMA and I would love to see where that leads .PERIOD <BREAK>
You may just know more about everything than anyone .PERIOD <BREAK>
It was a big idea ,COMMA for sure ,COMMA and it was one that he felt could truly inform and deeply affect the decision making of this body through animations of global data ,COMMA trends and other information regarding the globe ,COMMA on this sphere .PERIOD <BREAK>
We can use LEDs .PERIOD <BREAK>
In addition to higher resolution versions of this display ,COMMA my father and I are working on a new patent-pending design for a fully volumetric display using the same phenomenon .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so you could see that as this disc rotates about this axis ,COMMA it will create a disc of light that we can control .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's nothing new :COLON that's a propeller clock ;SEMICOLON that's the rims that you can buy for your car .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA as we continue to tinker with the oceans ,COMMA more and more reports are predicting that the kinds of seas that we're creating will be conducive to low-energy type of animals ,COMMA like jellyfish and bacteria .PERIOD <BREAK>
And this is this voracious predator launching a sneak attack on this poor little unsuspecting jellyfish there ,COMMA a by-the-wind sailor .PERIOD <BREAK>
It reaches up to almost 5000 pounds -- on a diet of jellyfish ,COMMA primarily .PERIOD <BREAK>
They like to sunbathe ,COMMA can't blame them .PERIOD <BREAK>
You know ,COMMA you look at sharks ,COMMA and they're streamlined ,COMMA and they're sleek ,COMMA and you look at tuna ,COMMA and they're like torpedoes -- they just give away their agenda .PERIOD They're about migration and strength ,COMMA and then you look at the sunfish .PERIOD <BREAK>
And this is just so elegantly mysterious ,COMMA it's just -- it really kind of holds its cards a lot tighter than say ,COMMA a tuna .PERIOD <BREAK>
And from that little egg ,COMMA they pass through this spiky little porcupine fish stage ,COMMA reminiscent of their ancestry ,COMMA and develop -- this is their little adolescent stage .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's a little diver up there in the corner .PERIOD <BREAK>
How do you do that with an animal -- very few places in the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it's pictured right here ,COMMA that little tag up there .PERIOD <BREAK>
But they have 40 genera of parasites ,COMMA and so we figured just one more parasite won't be too much of a problem .PERIOD <BREAK>
So what are we trying to find out ?QUESTIONMARK We're focusing on the Pacific .PERIOD <BREAK>
We're tagging on the California coast ,COMMA and we're tagging over in Taiwan and Japan .PERIOD <BREAK>
Not this time of year -- it's more around October .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I'm not exaggerating ,COMMA it is just -- and sometimes they don't eat them ,COMMA it's just spiteful .PERIOD <BREAK>
And they'll put their fins out and their eyes go in the back of their head ,COMMA and the fish come up and they just clean ,COMMA clean ,COMMA clean -- because the Molas ,COMMA you know ,COMMA there's just a smorgasbord of parasites .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'm going to show you our latest dataset .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we found that they kind of are homebodies .PERIOD <BREAK>
So that's a very important piece of data .PERIOD <BREAK>
But also what's important is that they're not slacker ,COMMA lazy fish .PERIOD <BREAK>
I set up a website because I was getting so many questions about Molas and sunfish .PERIOD <BREAK>
I was getting reports from Catholic nuns ,COMMA Jewish Rabbis ,COMMA Muslims ,COMMA Christians -- everybody writing in ,COMMA united by their love of life .PERIOD <BREAK>
One day a one-eyed monkey came into the forest .PERIOD <BREAK>

The other sort of genesis of what Von Neumann did was the difficulty of how you would predict the weather .PERIOD <BREAK>
RCA started this whole thing off ,COMMA and said ,COMMA you know ,COMMA televisions are the future ,COMMA not computers .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's where I grew up as a kid .PERIOD <BREAK>
All these forces came together there ,COMMA in Princeton .PERIOD <BREAK>
They didn't fit in at the Institute .PERIOD <BREAK>
And what they did at the Institute was publish every step of the way .PERIOD <BREAK>
All the computers now are copies of that machine .PERIOD <BREAK>

Damn it ,COMMA I can be just as stubborn as this thing .PERIOD <BREAK>
Everything up to this point is wasted time .PERIOD What's the use ?QUESTIONMARK Good night .PERIOD <BREAK>

He's still ahead of some of the stuff that's being done now .PERIOD <BREAK>
And he found all these ,COMMA sort of -- it was like a naturalist coming in and looking at this tiny ,COMMA 5000 -byte universe ,COMMA and seeing all these things happening that we see in the outside world ,COMMA in biology .PERIOD <BREAK>

So you could say that school food is quite important ,COMMA really ,COMMA judging the circumstances .PERIOD <BREAK>
The system is highly run by accountants ;SEMICOLON there's not enough ,COMMA or any ,COMMA food-knowledgeable people in the business .PERIOD <BREAK>
We don't teach kids about food .PERIOD Right ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And this is a little clip from an elementary school ,COMMA which is very common in England .PERIOD <BREAK>
I want to tell you about something ,COMMA I want to tell you about something that kind of epitomizes the trouble that we're in ,COMMA guys .PERIOD OK ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
I want to talk about something so basic as milk .PERIOD <BREAK>
Because someone at the milk board ,COMMA right -- and don't get me wrong ,COMMA I support milk -- but someone at the milk board probably paid a lot of money for some geezer to work out that if you put loads of flavorings and colorings and sugar in milk ,COMMA right ,COMMA more kids will drink it .PERIOD Yeah .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's in everything .PERIOD Even the milk hasn't escaped the kind of modern-day problems .PERIOD <BREAK>
There's our milk .PERIOD There's our carton .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I've taken the liberty of putting in just the five years of elementary school sugar ,COMMA just from milk .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA if I came up here ,COMMA and I wish I could come up here today and hang a cure for AIDS or cancer ,COMMA you'd be fighting and scrambling to get to me .PERIOD <BREAK>

Now ,COMMA also ,COMMA back to the sort of big brands :COLON Labeling ,COMMA I said earlier ,COMMA is an absolute farce and has got to be sorted .PERIOD <BREAK>

There's a strong whiff of half-baked anarchism about them .PERIOD <BREAK>
But one thing is true :COLON we are at the beginning of a mighty struggle for control of the Internet .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now this is a very complicated struggle .PERIOD <BREAK>
Instead ,COMMA we prefer these really dazzling technological solutions ,COMMA which cost a huge amount of money .PERIOD <BREAK>
But because they're a UN .PERIOD operation ,COMMA maybe that's why governments and corporations are not that interested in them .PERIOD <BREAK>
Because it's a UN .PERIOD operation ,COMMA of course ,COMMA it lacks funding .PERIOD <BREAK>
Cybercriminals would go there to buy and sell stolen credit card details ,COMMA to exchange information about new malware that was out there .PERIOD <BREAK>
The purchaser would send the administrative officer some dollars digitally ,COMMA and the vendor would sell the stolen credit card details .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now I spoke to one of these Carders who we'll call RedBrigade -- although that wasn't even his proper nickname -- but I promised I wouldn't reveal who he was .PERIOD <BREAK>

How would someone get over that kind of fear that the hacker they hire might preserve that little teensy wormhole ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
I think to an extent ,COMMA you have to understand that it's axiomatic among hackers that they do that .PERIOD <BREAK>
has about one-third the carbon footprint of the average suburban dweller ,COMMA mostly because suburbanites drive a lot more ,COMMA and living in detached buildings ,COMMA you have that much more exterior surface to leak energy out of .PERIOD <BREAK>
Whether you love suburbia's leafy privacy or you hate its soulless commercial strips ,COMMA there are reasons why it's important to retrofit .PERIOD <BREAK>
But is it practical ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
June Williamson and I have been researching this topic for over a decade ,COMMA and we've found over 80 varied projects .PERIOD <BREAK>
That basically ,COMMA the Boomers want to be able to age in place ,COMMA and Gen Y would like to live an urban lifestyle ,COMMA but most of their jobs will continue to be out in suburbia .PERIOD <BREAK>
Other malls have been re-inhabited as nursing homes ,COMMA as universities ,COMMA and as all variety of office space .PERIOD <BREAK>
We also found a lot of examples of dead big-box stores that have been converted into all sorts of community-serving uses as well -- lots of schools ,COMMA lots of churches and lots of libraries like this one .PERIOD <BREAK>
This one is a little L-shaped strip shopping center in Phoenix ,COMMA Arizona .PERIOD <BREAK>
Really all they did was they gave it a fresh coat of bright paint ,COMMA a gourmet grocery ,COMMA and they put up a restaurant in the old post office .PERIOD <BREAK>
Sometimes ,COMMA it's all at once .PERIOD <BREAK>
When Metrorail expanded transit into the suburbs and opened a station nearby to this site ,COMMA the owners decided to build a new parking deck and then insert on top of their surface lots a new Main Street ,COMMA several apartments and condo buildings ,COMMA while keeping the existing office buildings .PERIOD <BREAK>
So here's what it looks like .PERIOD <BREAK>
You can sort of see the funky new condo buildings in between the office buildings and the public space and the new Main Street .PERIOD <BREAK>
I think they really built an attractive place here and have just employed all-green construction .PERIOD <BREAK>
But it's also not really enough to just create pockets of walkability .PERIOD <BREAK>
So this is one that has been retrofitted in California .PERIOD <BREAK>
So there's a lot of great things ,COMMA but I'd love to see more corridors getting retrofitting .PERIOD <BREAK>
Sometimes re-greening is really the better answer .PERIOD <BREAK>
There's also a burgeoning suburban farming movement -- sort of victory gardens meets the Internet .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA retrofits are often accused of being examples of faux downtowns and instant urbanism ,COMMA and not without reason ;SEMICOLON you don't get much more phony than an Astroturf town green .PERIOD <BREAK>
I have to say ,COMMA these are very hybrid places .PERIOD <BREAK>
Or maybe it's because when I was a teenager back in the ' 50 s ,COMMA my uncle Henry -- having denounced the Ku Klux Klan and been bombed for his trouble and had crosses burned in his yard ,COMMA living under death threat -- took his wife and children to Massachusetts for safety and went back to South Carolina to face down the Klan alone .PERIOD <BREAK>
Never mind the fact that they were slow to acknowledge they needed saving .PERIOD <BREAK>

One woman took that energy and she said ,COMMA I want to bring this wave ,COMMA this energy ,COMMA to college campuses ,COMMA and so she took the play and she said ,COMMA Let's use the play and have performances of the play once a year ,COMMA where we can raise money to stop violence against women in local communities all around the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
And this is a very heady place .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's a body world ,COMMA and the species really exists in the body ,COMMA and I think there's a real significance in us attaching our bodies to our heads -- that that separation has created a divide that is often separating purpose from intent .PERIOD <BREAK>
When we met her three years ago ,COMMA we said ,COMMA What could V-Day do for you ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA Mr .PERIOD Alligator never did come ,COMMA but the idea of Mr .PERIOD Alligator coming actually saved my sanity and made it OK for me to keep going because I believed ,COMMA in the distance ,COMMA there would be someone coming to rescue me .PERIOD <BREAK>
They're like the Mercedes-Benz of the Rift Valley .PERIOD <BREAK>
And he'd show up obviously in a form that it took me a long time to understand ,COMMA which is that when we give in the world what we want the most ,COMMA we heal the broken part inside each of us .PERIOD <BREAK>
We can reconcile .PERIOD <BREAK>
We can do everything .PERIOD <BREAK>

But if you were to put it on an equal area projection ,COMMA you'd see that the mid-ocean ridge covers 23 percent of the Earth's total surface area .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is what a real one looks like ,COMMA on the Juan de Fuca Ridge .PERIOD <BREAK>
But more importantly ,COMMA they discovered edifices down there that they did not understand .PERIOD <BREAK>
We found the Bismarck in 16000 feet .PERIOD We then found the Yorktown .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we stole recently a ship from the United States Navy .PERIOD <BREAK>
It comes online this summer ,COMMA and it begins its journey of exploration .PERIOD <BREAK>
We have no idea what we're going to discover .PERIOD <BREAK>
And when you get a jaw drop ,COMMA you can inform .PERIOD <BREAK>
This ,COMMA I hope ,COMMA will be a future engineer or a future scientist in the battle for truth .PERIOD <BREAK>
You must get them custom made -- special ,COMMA humongous guitars .PERIOD <BREAK>
I thought narcissism meant you loved yourself .PERIOD <BREAK>
But I want to ,COMMA though ,COMMA explain how I came to design my own particular brand of comedy because I've been through so many different forms of it .PERIOD <BREAK>
I started with improvisation ,COMMA in a particular form of improvisation called theater games ,COMMA which had one rule ,COMMA which I always thought was a great rule for an ethic for a society .PERIOD <BREAK>
But only two percent don't know the effect that the debacle in Argentina will have on the IMF's monetary policy -- seems a contradiction .PERIOD <BREAK>
So this subject-object thing ,COMMA is part of something I'm very interested in because this is why ,COMMA frankly ,COMMA I believe in political correctness .PERIOD <BREAK>
Maybe too far .PERIOD But you know -- I don't think that a person of color making fun of white people is the same thing as a white person making fun of people of color .PERIOD <BREAK>
There always had to be the butt of a joke .PERIOD <BREAK>
And then coming to this conference ,COMMA I realized that most everybody here shared those same qualities because really what trickster is is an agent of change .PERIOD <BREAK>
I hope that's my agent ,COMMA because you aren't paying me anything .PERIOD <BREAK>
And he said that I had to show more respect because it took up to 18 years to learn how to do mime properly .PERIOD <BREAK>
Huh ?QUESTIONMARK Huh ?QUESTIONMARK What ?QUESTIONMARK Can't hear you .PERIOD <BREAK>
But here's how I think I like to make change ,COMMA and that is in making connections .PERIOD <BREAK>
And didn't that feel good ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And now we're being penetrated .PERIOD <BREAK>
I still have a way to go .PERIOD <BREAK>
And what I hope to do ,COMMA when I make these connections ,COMMA is short circuit people's thinking .PERIOD <BREAK>
I like to think of what I do as a probability wave .PERIOD <BREAK>
And thank you for inviting me into it .PERIOD <BREAK>
Can we run that ,COMMA Andrew ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
I would propose ,COMMA therefore ,COMMA that if we took 10 billion dollars from that 213 trillion dollar budget -- which is two one hundredths of that budget -- and we doled out a billion dollars to each one of these problems I'm going to talk to you about ,COMMA the vast majority could be solved ,COMMA and the rest we could deal with .PERIOD So ,COMMA I hope you find this both fascinating -- I'm fascinated by this kind of stuff ,COMMA I gotta admit -- to me these are Richard's cockroaches .PERIOD <BREAK>
We live in an incredible age of modern medicine .PERIOD <BREAK>
We are all much healthier than we were 20 years ago .PERIOD <BREAK>
Soon ,COMMA genetic breakthroughs and even better medicine are going to allow us to think of 100 as a normal lifespan .PERIOD <BREAK>
We don't really have mental health insurance in this country ,COMMA and it's -- -- it's really a crime .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA what are the solutions to this ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Thank God you can all read !EXCLAMATIONMARK <BREAK>
Many other ecosystems on Earth are in real ,COMMA real danger .PERIOD <BREAK>
They expect them to evaporate .PERIOD <BREAK>
This stuff was supposed to only be feed for animals in the United States ,COMMA and it got into the human food supply ,COMMA and somebody should've figured out that it would get in the human food supply very easily .PERIOD <BREAK>
This brings back a skepticism that has gone away recently ,COMMA that superweeds and superpests could spread around the world ,COMMA from biotechnology ,COMMA that literally could destroy the world's food supply in very short order .PERIOD <BREAK>
Believe it or not ,COMMA this happens every few hundred thousand years ,COMMA and has happened many times in our history .PERIOD <BREAK>
But what happens ,COMMA as this occurs ,COMMA is that we lose our magnetic field around the Earth over the period of about 100 years ,COMMA and that means that all these cosmic rays and particles that are to come streaming at us from the sun ,COMMA that this field protects us from ,COMMA are -- well ,COMMA basically ,COMMA we're gonna fry .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA maybe we're in the throes of it .PERIOD <BREAK>
There's a flip side to it .PERIOD In studying stars like our Sun ,COMMA we've found that they go through periods of diminishment ,COMMA when their total amount of energy that's expelled from them goes down by maybe one percent .PERIOD <BREAK>
We've all learned what -- the kind of panic that can occur when an old disease rears its head ,COMMA like anthrax .PERIOD <BREAK>
Again ,COMMA we gotta think about being a colonizing race .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's a mistake that could literally cost us our future .PERIOD <BREAK>
And he scans across the ocean ,COMMA and he looks at the sky .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now I don't expect all of you to see all the details here ,COMMA but what I want you to see is this is about 10 percent of the processes that operate within the oceans almost continuously ,COMMA and have for the last 4 billion years .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is very ,COMMA very important because this is the system ,COMMA this is the crucible ,COMMA out of which life on the planet came ,COMMA and it's now time for us to understand it .PERIOD <BREAK>
All right ,COMMA let's talk about another perspective on the importance of the oceans .PERIOD <BREAK>
Seconds after this video was taken ,COMMA people in Beijing ,COMMA people in Sydney ,COMMA people in Amsterdam ,COMMA people in Washington DC .PERIOD were watching this .PERIOD <BREAK>
I won't talk a lot about most of them right here ,COMMA but the one on the west coast ,COMMA that's in the box ,COMMA is called the regional scale nodes .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is going to be much more powerful than having a single ship in a single location ,COMMA then move to a new location .PERIOD <BREAK>
Robotics systems are just incredible these days ,COMMA absolutely incredible .PERIOD <BREAK>
What are the troops ?QUESTIONMARK The troops are the autonomous vehicles ,COMMA of course .PERIOD <BREAK>
They eject it to the surface where it floats ,COMMA and it is picked up by an autonomous airplane ,COMMA and it's brought back to the laboratory within 24 hours of the eruption .PERIOD <BREAK>
A laboratory :COLON many of you heard what happened on 9 / 7 .PERIOD <BREAK>
We could do work on the sea floor that would be stunning ,COMMA and it would be on live TV ,COMMA if we have interesting things to show .PERIOD <BREAK>
So we can bring an entirely new telepresence to the world ,COMMA throughout the ocean .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's going to be amazing .PERIOD <BREAK>
He won the Nobel Prize for literature in 1948 .PERIOD <BREAK>
But it is a story of effort and struggle against improbabilities .PERIOD <BREAK>
These are the dimensions that I like to work with .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's something very personal .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's not ,COMMA perhaps ,COMMA the dimensions appreciated by art critics or architecture critics or city planners .PERIOD <BREAK>
And today we have a kind of evangelical pessimism all around us .PERIOD <BREAK>
I have never been a fan of the neutral .PERIOD <BREAK>
Expressive spaces are not spaces that simply confirm what we already know .PERIOD <BREAK>
Life is not just an anesthetic to make us smile ,COMMA but to reach out across the abyss of history ,COMMA to places we have never been ,COMMA and would have perhaps been ,COMMA had we not been so lucky .PERIOD <BREAK>
Radical ,COMMA what does it mean ?QUESTIONMARK It's something which is rooted ,COMMA and something which is rooted deep in a tradition .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's not something that has a good ending or a bad ending .PERIOD <BREAK>
Therefore I believe it should not be cool .PERIOD <BREAK>
Listening to all of you ,COMMA the complexity of thought ,COMMA the complexity of layers of meaning is overwhelming .PERIOD <BREAK>
The political is not an enemy of architecture .PERIOD <BREAK>
So the unexpected is always unexpected .PERIOD <BREAK>
So not the habitual architecture that instills in us the false sort of stability ,COMMA but an architecture that is full of tension ,COMMA an architecture that goes beyond itself to reach a human soul and a human heart ,COMMA and that breaks out of the shackles of habits .PERIOD <BREAK>
What is raw ?QUESTIONMARK The raw ,COMMA I would say is the naked experience ,COMMA untouched by luxury ,COMMA untouched by expensive materials ,COMMA untouched by the kind of refinement that we associate with high culture .PERIOD <BREAK>
So that is indeed what is memory .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it's not only our memory ,COMMA but those who remember us ,COMMA which means that architecture is not mute .PERIOD <BREAK>
You know it costs a lot of money and so on ,COMMA but yes ,COMMA it should not play it safe .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's about carving out a space for trees .PERIOD <BREAK>
And yet ,COMMA in all its messiness ,COMMA in all its difficulties ,COMMA I would not have liked somebody to say ,COMMA This is the tabula rasa ,COMMA mister architect -- do whatever you want .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it is about the dirty word compromise .PERIOD Compromise is not bad .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's difficult .PERIOD 2011 ,COMMA 2013 .PERIOD Freedom Tower ,COMMA the memorial .PERIOD <BREAK>
Daniel Libeskind :COLON Look .PERIOD We have to cure ourselves of the notion that we are authoritarian ,COMMA that we can determine everything that happens .PERIOD <BREAK>
Namibia has got 21 million people ,COMMA but it is only twice the size of California .PERIOD <BREAK>
Most people that are following the story of Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt will know where Namibia is .PERIOD <BREAK>
You might wonder ,COMMA why are you wearing these Western clothes ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Boy ,COMMA if you are looking after our livestock and you see a cheetah eating our goat -- cheetah is very nervous -- just walk up to it .PERIOD <BREAK>
But then he said ,COMMA Boy ,COMMA if you run into a lion ,COMMA don't move .PERIOD <BREAK>
We lived under apartheid regime .PERIOD <BREAK>
And then ,COMMA in the same year ,COMMA we almost lost everything .PERIOD <BREAK>
With independence ,COMMA the whole approach of community getting involved was embraced by our new government .PERIOD <BREAK>
Three things that actually help to build on this foundation :COLON The very first one is honoring of tradition and being open to new ideas .PERIOD <BREAK>
And at this sacred fire ,COMMA the spirit of our ancestors speak through the headman and advise us where to get water ,COMMA where to get grazings ,COMMA and where to go and hunt .PERIOD <BREAK>
Transporting rhinos using helicopters I think is much easier than talking through a spirit that you can't see ,COMMA isn't it ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
The other partners that we have got is business communities .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so far ,COMMA with the support of World Wildlife Fund ,COMMA we've been able to scale up the very small programs to national programs today .PERIOD <BREAK>
Namibia .PERIOD or Sesfontein was no more an isolated village somewhere ,COMMA hidden away in Namibia .PERIOD <BREAK>
What started as very small ,COMMA community rangers getting community involved ,COMMA has now grown into something that we call conservancies .PERIOD <BREAK>
In 2008 ,COMMA conservancy generated 57 million dollars .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is our new economy -- an economy based on the respect of our natural resources .PERIOD <BREAK>
You know that Africa is being affected by these viruses .PERIOD <BREAK>
There is great confusion when the two look at each other .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'm fascinated by the beauty of it ,COMMA the mutability of it ,COMMA the malleability of it ,COMMA and the fabulous shapes in which it can carve itself .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's outside Antarctica .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's a big undertaking .PERIOD I stand here before you tonight as an ambassador for my whole team .PERIOD <BREAK>
There's a lot of people working on this right now .PERIOD <BREAK>
If everybody in the developed world understood this graph ,COMMA and emblazoned it on the inside of their foreheads ,COMMA there would be no further societal argument about climate change because this is the story that counts .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is what one of our cameras saw over the course of a few months .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's the retreat of this glacier .PERIOD <BREAK>
Geologic process in action here .PERIOD <BREAK>
Greenland took a little while to start reacting to the warming climate of the past century ,COMMA but it really started galloping along about 20 years ago .PERIOD <BREAK>
Helicopter in front of the calving face for scale ,COMMA quickly dwarfed .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's flowing out to the Atlantic Ocean on the left .PERIOD <BREAK>
We just downloaded these pictures a couple weeks ago ,COMMA as you can see .PERIOD June 25 th ,COMMA monster calving events happened .PERIOD <BREAK>
Huge icebergs rolling over .PERIOD <BREAK>
So an illustration again ,COMMA gives you a feeling for scale .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is a terrific ,COMMA terrific call to arms to do the right thing for ourselves and for the future .PERIOD <BREAK>
Understanding all of this enables us to shift our perception of seafood away from a commodity to an opportunity to restore our ecosystem .PERIOD <BREAK>
Great for fishermen .PERIOD Lots of money .PERIOD Supporting local economies .PERIOD <BREAK>
So the first thing about this idea of restorative seafood is that it really takes into account our needs .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the best part is all of those ingredients are available to every family at the neighborhood Walmart .PERIOD <BREAK>
Forget nuclear holocaust ;SEMICOLON it's the fork that we have to worry about .PERIOD <BREAK>
People started buying appetizers and salads ,COMMA because they knew they weren't going to fill up on the entrees alone .PERIOD <BREAK>
People spent more time engaging in their meals ,COMMA engaging with each other over their meals .PERIOD <BREAK>
They got healthier .PERIOD I made more money .PERIOD <BREAK>
I get sick when I go to steakhouses .PERIOD <BREAK>
The punch line ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And this is a song medley I put together -- Did you ever notice that four in the morning has become some sort of meme or shorthand ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
A time for plotting to whack the chief of police ,COMMA like in this classic scene from The Godfather .PERIOD <BREAK>
It works a little something like -- this is a recent Google search for four in the morning .PERIOD <BREAK>
Coincidence to me has a much simpler metric .PERIOD <BREAK>
Herbert Powell :COLON Sure ,COMMA that's what he's paid for .PERIOD <BREAK>
And folks ,COMMA you can buy a copy of Bill Clinton's My Life from the bookstore here at TED .PERIOD <BREAK>
By his own writing ,COMMA this man was either asleep ,COMMA at a prayer meeting with Al and Tipper or learning how to launch a nuclear missile out of a suitcase .PERIOD <BREAK>
And once we get involved in the therapeutic decisions ,COMMA again either personally or with our loved ones and family members ,COMMA we also very quickly learn the benefits ,COMMA the trade-offs and the limitations of these tools .PERIOD <BREAK>
We can all picture astronauts in space .PERIOD <BREAK>
And in that space station we have the genetic material ,COMMA the chromosomes ,COMMA within a nucleus .PERIOD <BREAK>
And when that cellular space station is within the electric field ,COMMA it acts on those highly charged proteins and aligns them .PERIOD <BREAK>
What we saw in that trial is that that the life expectancies of both groups -- so the chemotherapy treated group and the Tumor Treating Field group -- was the same .PERIOD <BREAK>
Importantly ,COMMA it was the first time ever that the FDA included in their approval of an oncology treatment a quality of life claim .PERIOD <BREAK>
You can see that the black regions in the upper right quadrant are the areas where he had surgery .PERIOD <BREAK>
At this point ,COMMA he was told by his doctors that he had about 3 months to live .PERIOD <BREAK>
First of all ,COMMA these electrodes are noninvasive .PERIOD <BREAK>
There's none of what is called the chemo head .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's a medical device ;SEMICOLON it works when it's on .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's now five years since Robert's diagnosis ,COMMA and he's alive ,COMMA but importantly ,COMMA he's healthy and he's at work .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'm going to let him ,COMMA in this very short clip ,COMMA describe his impressions of the therapy in his own words .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'm going to show you another clip of a woman named Lydia .PERIOD <BREAK>
She underwent four different regimes of chemotherapy over two years ,COMMA none of which had an effect .PERIOD <BREAK>
Her cancer continued to grow .PERIOD <BREAK>
She's interacting with her kids and her grand kids .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's only the beginning .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I firmly believe that in the next 10 years Tumor Treating Fields will be a weapon available to doctors and patients for all of these most-difficult-to-treat solid tumors .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the water will go where it should go .PERIOD <BREAK>
And people made their house ,COMMA and the water storage tanks .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is near Jaipur .PERIOD This is called the Jaigarh Fort .PERIOD <BREAK>
It can break sometimes .PERIOD <BREAK>
It can envy many municipalities ,COMMA the color ,COMMA the taste ,COMMA the purity of this water .PERIOD <BREAK>
And people started renovating their own structures .PERIOD <BREAK>
Such a limited rainfall ,COMMA and highest colorful life flourished in these areas .PERIOD <BREAK>
But it is invisible .PERIOD <BREAK>
And then they will come and worship this pond ,COMMA pay respect ,COMMA their gratitude .PERIOD <BREAK>
And perhaps they knew the future also .PERIOD <BREAK>
How they maintain them ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Don't spit ,COMMA don't do anything wrong ,COMMA so that the clean water can be collected .PERIOD <BREAK>
If you climb these three ,COMMA six steps you will find something very nice .PERIOD <BREAK>
They say that a picture is worth a thousand words ,COMMA so we can say a thousand words right now ,COMMA an another thousand words .PERIOD <BREAK>
There were no English medium schools at that time ,COMMA even no Hindi schools ,COMMA [unclear] schools .PERIOD <BREAK>
but not to create the engineering colleges .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA you can find through your Jeep ,COMMA a camel ,COMMA and a cart .PERIOD <BREAK>
Thank you very much .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA the ponds ,COMMA the open bodies ,COMMA are everywhere ,COMMA right from Sri Lanka to Kashmir ,COMMA and in other parts also .PERIOD <BREAK>
And these [unclear] ,COMMA which stored water ,COMMA there are two type of things .PERIOD <BREAK>
It was never popular with many political leaders ,COMMA especially those in the United States who somehow thought that new media would be able to do what missiles couldn't .PERIOD <BREAK>
And they are building what I call the Spinternet .PERIOD <BREAK>
And police said that it happened because he was playing hide and seek ,COMMA which is elude the cat in Chinese slang ,COMMA with other inmates and hit his head against the wall ,COMMA which was not an explanation which sat well with many Chinese bloggers .PERIOD <BREAK>
So they immediately began posting a lot of critical comments .PERIOD <BREAK>
And this actually fits with another interesting theory about what's happening in authoritarian states and in their cyberspace .PERIOD <BREAK>
And first it's quite simple .PERIOD <BREAK>
So from this perspective ,COMMA having blogs and wikis produce knowledge has been great .PERIOD <BREAK>
So inviting people to all sorts of public forums ,COMMA having them participate in decision making ,COMMA it's actually great .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it's great simply because they can gather open source intelligence .PERIOD <BREAK>
I mean KGB ,COMMA and not just KGB ,COMMA used to torture in order to actually get this data .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now it's all available online .PERIOD <BREAK>
So what should we do about it ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Why are you crying ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
No ,COMMA the boy said to me -- the boy said to me ,COMMA It would destroy me .PERIOD <BREAK>
And he did spend a lot of time up to no good .PERIOD <BREAK>
His father wasn't on the set .PERIOD <BREAK>
We all looked up to him .PERIOD <BREAK>
She's what I know today to be mentally ill ,COMMA higher-functioning at times than others .PERIOD <BREAK>
So when I go in the room ,COMMA I close the door .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now I say this all with remorse ,COMMA and I was feeling a tremendous amount of remorse at that time ,COMMA but I was conflicted ,COMMA because ,COMMA while I was feeling remorse ,COMMA I was excited ,COMMA because I didn't get caught .PERIOD <BREAK>
I need you working with me and me working with you on how we raise our sons and teach them to be men -- that it's okay to not be dominating ,COMMA that it's okay to have feelings and emotions ,COMMA that it's okay to promote equality ,COMMA that it's okay to have women who are just friends and that's it ,COMMA that it's okay to be whole ,COMMA that my liberation as a man is tied to your liberation as a woman .PERIOD <BREAK>
Indeed ,COMMA what worries me is the entire notion of world leadership seems to me terribly archaic .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's redolent of James Bond movies and Kipling ballads .PERIOD <BREAK>
And in the information era we all live in today ,COMMA what we might call the TED age ,COMMA I'd say that countries are increasingly being judged by a global public that's been fed on an incessant diet of Internet news ,COMMA of televised images ,COMMA of cellphone videos ,COMMA of email gossip .PERIOD <BREAK>
We've been selling 15 million cellphones a month .PERIOD <BREAK>
They had to suspend functions at 830 .PERIOD <BREAK>
And they scrawled on the windshield in a reference to the show's heroine ,COMMA Tulsi Zindabad :COLON Long live Tulsi .PERIOD <BREAK>
In fact ,COMMA legend has is that when Doubting Thomas ,COMMA the Apostle ,COMMA Saint Thomas ,COMMA landed on the shores of Kerala ,COMMA my home state ,COMMA somewhere around 52 AD ,COMMA he was welcomed on shore by a flute-playing Jewish girl .PERIOD <BREAK>
But ,COMMA the fact is that the last elections ,COMMA five years ago ,COMMA gave the world extraordinary phenomenon of an election being won by a woman political leader of Italian origin and Roman Catholic faith ,COMMA Sonia Gandhi ,COMMA who then made way for a Sikh ,COMMA Mohan Singh ,COMMA to be sworn in as Prime Minister by a Muslim ,COMMA President Abdul Kalam ,COMMA in a country 81 percent Hindu .PERIOD <BREAK>
All the others have been all those three .PERIOD <BREAK>
In fact ,COMMA you can't even take the name of the country for granted ,COMMA because the name India comes from the river Indus ,COMMA which flows in Pakistan .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's the idea of an ever-ever-land ,COMMA emerging from an ancient civilization ,COMMA united by a shared history ,COMMA but sustained ,COMMA above all ,COMMA by pluralist democracy .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA that is the India that is emerging into the 21 st century .PERIOD <BREAK>
And ,COMMA I mean ,COMMA the world apparently is running out too .PERIOD <BREAK>
And trying to attach this to things that were themselves attached to certain specific target zones ,COMMA bacteria that we don't like .PERIOD <BREAK>
So you can find a little feature on a bacterium that you don't like ,COMMA like Staphylococcus -- I don't like it in particular ,COMMA because it killed a professor friend of mine last year .PERIOD <BREAK>
So this was pretty shocking to me ,COMMA that we could do this .PERIOD <BREAK>
And there's the very important thing there :COLON If you want to survive the cold ,COMMA you ought to be suspended .PERIOD Right ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
The highest concentration is in our brains .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so ,COMMA we wanted to find out might we be able to use hydrogen sulfide in the presence of cold ,COMMA and we wanted to see whether we could reproduce this skier in a mammal .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA we wondered :COLON Can we do anything useful with this capacity to control metabolic flexibility ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
We ought to be able to lower supply to unprecedented low levels without killing the animal .PERIOD <BREAK>
And this company ,COMMA the first thing it did was make a liquid formulation of hydrogen sulfide an injectable form that we could put in and send it out to physician scientists all over the world who work on models of critical care medicine ,COMMA and the results are incredibly positive .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I should say that the concentrations of hydrogen sulfide required to get this benefit are low ,COMMA incredibly low .PERIOD <BREAK>
You don't want to be gorking people out just to save them ,COMMA it's really confusing .PERIOD <BREAK>
I’m going around the world giving talks about Darwin ,COMMA and usually what I’m talking about is Darwin’s strange inversion of reasoning .PERIOD <BREAK>
Exactly .PERIOD Exactly .PERIOD And it is a strange inversion .PERIOD <BREAK>
If you looked at glucose molecules till you were blind ,COMMA you wouldn’t see why they tasted sweet .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it’s a good thing that there isn’t ,COMMA because if there were ,COMMA then Mother Nature would have a problem :COLON How on earth do you get chimps to mate ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
What we see with ,COMMA say ,COMMA chocolate cake is it’s a supernormal stimulus to tweak our design wiring .PERIOD <BREAK>
You’ve got 30 seconds ,COMMA you’d better be fast .PERIOD <BREAK>
Yes ,COMMA lot’s of laughter .PERIOD Yeah ,COMMA exactly .PERIOD <BREAK>
So we might have a wild idea ,COMMA but we’re afraid to share it with anybody else .PERIOD <BREAK>
They just quite happily show their masterpiece to whoever wants to look at it .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA that wasn’t just self-indulgence .PERIOD <BREAK>
It takes more than decor ,COMMA but I think we’ve all seen that creative companies do often have symbols in the workplace that remind people to be playful ,COMMA and that it’s a permissive environment .PERIOD <BREAK>
But why is it important ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
We use it in a pretty pragmatic way ,COMMA to be honest .PERIOD <BREAK>
And you know ,COMMA the more creative of them might get to a really interesting example .PERIOD <BREAK>
So another one of Bob McKim’s favorite exercises is called the 30 Circles Test .PERIOD <BREAK>
Okay .PERIOD Put down your pencils ,COMMA as they say .PERIOD <BREAK>
15 ?QUESTIONMARK 20 ?QUESTIONMARK Anybody get all 30 ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
I just wanted you to fill in as many circles as possible .PERIOD <BREAK>
We stop ourselves from doing things .PERIOD <BREAK>
I think the Eameses are wonderful examples of experimentation .PERIOD <BREAK>
They went from designing splints for wounded soldiers coming out of World War II and the Korean War ,COMMA I think ,COMMA and from this experiment they moved on to chairs .PERIOD <BREAK>
When play is about building a tower out of blocks ,COMMA the kid begins to learn a lot about towers .PERIOD <BREAK>
And as they repeatedly knock it down and start again ,COMMA learning is happening as a sort of by-product of play .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA they learned their way to that by building prototypes .PERIOD <BREAK>
And all of a sudden a productive conversation was happening about design around a tangible object .PERIOD <BREAK>
The prototyping carts ,COMMA filled with colored paper and Play-Doh and glue sticks and stuff -- I mean ,COMMA they do have a bit of a kindergarten feel to them .PERIOD <BREAK>
But by giving project teams and the clients who they’re working with permission to think with their hands ,COMMA quite complex ideas can spring into life and go right through to execution much more easily .PERIOD <BREAK>
We’re doing the same thing as designers .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA remember the sketching task we did at the beginning ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
As designers ,COMMA we need to be able to transition in and out of play also .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it doesn't take long to go downhill .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I got distracted by it .PERIOD <BREAK>
And suddenly I was on the phone to my stockbroker and my real estate agent ,COMMA when I should have been talking to my clients .PERIOD <BREAK>
My partner and I ,COMMA Thom ,COMMA we had to let all our employees go .PERIOD <BREAK>
Because with no employees ,COMMA there was nobody for me to manage .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I grew up in this little farming town in northern Nevada .PERIOD <BREAK>
Britlin was so innocent and so sweet ,COMMA and her voice was so pure .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I had this idea :COLON if I could get 50 people to all do this same thing ,COMMA sing their parts -- soprano ,COMMA alto ,COMMA tenor and bass -- wherever they were in the world ,COMMA post their videos to YouTube ,COMMA we could cut it all together and create a virtual choir .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I sent out this call to singers .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I made free the download of the music to a piece that I had written in the year 2000 called Lux Aurumque ,COMMA which means light and gold .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is Evangelina Etienne from Massachusetts .PERIOD <BREAK>
I was told later ,COMMA and also by lots of singers who were involved in this ,COMMA that they sometimes recorded 50 or 60 different takes until they got just the right take -- they uploaded it .PERIOD <BREAK>
He scrubbed the audio .PERIOD <BREAK>
And then we posted this video to YouTube about a year and a half ago .PERIOD <BREAK>
We had a million hits in the first month and got a lot of attention for it .PERIOD <BREAK>
And there were 900 people involved in that .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we also put a page on Facebook for the singers to upload their testimonials ,COMMA what it was like for them ,COMMA their experience singing it .PERIOD <BREAK>
My sister and I used to sing in choirs together constantly .PERIOD <BREAK>
Me too .PERIOD <BREAK>
It is a dream come true to be part of this choir ,COMMA as I've never been part of one .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the second is that people seem to be experiencing an actual connection .PERIOD <BREAK>
It wasn't a virtual choir .PERIOD <BREAK>
But ,COMMA I know myself too ,COMMA I feel this virtual esprit de corps ,COMMA if you will ,COMMA with all of them .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is a recording I made of a mantis shrimp that's found off the coast of California .PERIOD <BREAK>
And mantis shrimp are called mantis shrimp after the praying mantises ,COMMA which also have a fast feeding appendage .PERIOD And I started to think ,COMMA well ,COMMA maybe it will be interesting ,COMMA while listening to their sounds ,COMMA to figure out how these animals generate very fast feeding strikes .PERIOD <BREAK>
So we got this incredible video system .PERIOD It's very new technology -- it just came out about a year ago -- that allows you to film at extremely high speeds in low light .PERIOD <BREAK>
And as you'll notice ,COMMA it's still pretty gosh darn fast slowed down 333 times .PERIOD It's an incredibly powerful movement .PERIOD <BREAK>
So what we calculated was that the limbs were moving at the peak speed ranging from 10 meters per second all the way up to 23 meters per second .PERIOD <BREAK>
It takes a long time for the muscle to contract ,COMMA and a very short time for the limb to fly out .PERIOD <BREAK>
There needs to be some kind of spring-loaded mechanism in order to generate the amount of force that we observe ,COMMA and the speed that we observe ,COMMA and the output of the system .PERIOD <BREAK>
The saddle-shaped structure is also known as a hyperbolic paraboloid surface ,COMMA or an anticlastic surface .PERIOD <BREAK>
In biological systems it's important not to have a whole lot of extra material requirements for building it .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so this is just a regular video of the animal just smashing the heck out of this load cell .PERIOD <BREAK>
And again ,COMMA I think this will be a world record .PERIOD <BREAK>
And what I'd like you to do in this shot is keep your eye on this ,COMMA on the surface of the load cell ,COMMA as the limb comes flying through .PERIOD <BREAK>
People have been struggling for years to try and design a very fast rotating boat propeller that doesn't cavitate and literally wear away the metal and put holes in it ,COMMA just like these pictures show .PERIOD <BREAK>
In fact ,COMMA you might have even seen some cavitation going up the edge of the limb .PERIOD <BREAK>
Very ,COMMA very convenient solution to that particular problem .PERIOD <BREAK>
And there's actually a spectacular colored dot in the center of the saddles of many species of stomatopods .PERIOD <BREAK>
And this is quite interesting ,COMMA to find evolutionary origins of visual signals on what's really ,COMMA in all species ,COMMA their spring .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so I'm very curious about whether those colored dots in the center of the saddles are conveying some kind of information about their ability to strike ,COMMA or their strike force ,COMMA and something about the time period in the molting cycle .PERIOD <BREAK>
We still have one foot in the dark ages .PERIOD <BREAK>
TS .PERIOD Eliot really said it for me -- and this should give you goose bumps :COLON we shall not cease from exploration and the end of our exploring shall be to return where we started and know the place for the first time .PERIOD <BREAK>
It’s a thin film ,COMMA two-dimensional existence .PERIOD <BREAK>
And if you hefted those two things you might find that the relative scale of those is 20 to 1 .PERIOD <BREAK>
It actually is a very good working sub -- that’s what it was designed for .PERIOD <BREAK>
A seat works in a two-dimensional world ,COMMA where gravity blasts down on that seat ,COMMA OK ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Most of life on earth is in that inner atmosphere .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is a three-dimensional machine .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is man’s first attempt at flying underwater .PERIOD <BREAK>
Chris asked us to show stuff that hasn’t been shown before .PERIOD <BREAK>
I’m trying to do everything very gently .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is the first flying machine .PERIOD This was the first prototype .PERIOD <BREAK>
There’re no silly buoyancy tanks -- it’s permanently ,COMMA positively buoyant .PERIOD <BREAK>
She’s just a few inches off the top of my head .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so ,COMMA how I see my work contributing is sort of trying to literally re-imagine these connections and physically rebuild them .PERIOD <BREAK>
So the era of big infrastructure is over .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA albeit a very small creature and very modest ,COMMA this creature is incredible ,COMMA because it can agglomerate into these mega-reef structures .PERIOD <BREAK>
But you can see ,COMMA even just intuit ,COMMA from this map ,COMMA that the harbor has dredged and flattened ,COMMA and went from a rich ,COMMA three-dimensional mosaic to flat muck in really a matter of years .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now the Gowanus is particularly smelly -- I will admit it .PERIOD <BREAK>
When we started this project ,COMMA one of the core ideas was to look back in history and try to understand what was there .PERIOD <BREAK>
We also learned at this time that you could eat an oyster about the size of a dinner plate in the Gowanus Canal itself .PERIOD <BREAK>
It accepts algae and detritus in one end ,COMMA and through this beautiful ,COMMA glamorous set of stomach organs ,COMMA out the other end comes cleaner water .PERIOD <BREAK>
Basically ,COMMA New York was built on the backs of oystermen ,COMMA and our streets were literally built over oyster shells .PERIOD <BREAK>
What is fuzzy rope ,COMMA you ask ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
So we imagine that we would actually potentially even host a bake sale to start our new project .PERIOD <BREAK>
So get your Tevas on .PERIOD <BREAK>
And then those spat are then seeded .PERIOD <BREAK>
And also showing oyster gardening for the community along its edges .PERIOD <BREAK>
And finally ,COMMA how much fun it would be to watch the flupsy parade and cheer on the oyster spats as they go down to the reef .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA sorry -- it just feels like I should be doing stand-up up here because of the setting .PERIOD <BREAK>
Because if we get it out of the streets ,COMMA it'll smell much better ,COMMA and -- oh right ,COMMA we drink from the river .PERIOD <BREAK>
And he'd made the case in a number of papers and done a number of studies ,COMMA but nothing had really stuck .PERIOD <BREAK>
You can't really see it in this map ,COMMA but this is the map that becomes the central focus in the second half of my book .PERIOD <BREAK>
So it was this incredibly terrifying event .PERIOD <BREAK>
Just an extraordinary ,COMMA terrifying scene .PERIOD <BREAK>
And eventually Snow made a map of the outbreak .PERIOD <BREAK>
And he thought about representing that as a kind of a table of statistics of people living in different neighborhoods ,COMMA people who hadn't ,COMMA you know ,COMMA percentages of people who hadn't ,COMMA but eventually he hit upon the idea that what he needed was something that you could see .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so ,COMMA with the help of this map ,COMMA and with the help of more evangelizing that he did over the next few years and that Whitehead did ,COMMA eventually ,COMMA actually ,COMMA the authorities slowly started to come around .PERIOD <BREAK>
We don't worry that New York City is going to collapse in on itself quite the way that ,COMMA you know ,COMMA Rome did ,COMMA and be 10 percent of its size in 100 years or 200 years .PERIOD <BREAK>
His whole monastery was thrown into prison at the time of the uprising ,COMMA when the Dalai Lama had to leave Tibet .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it just so happened ,COMMA on the fifth week ,COMMA there was a public teaching by the Dalai Lama .PERIOD <BREAK>
I interview and do portraits .PERIOD <BREAK>
So this is our icon to non-violence in our world -- one of our living icons .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is Mengatoue .PERIOD <BREAK>
He's the shaman of the Huaorani ,COMMA and he said to us ,COMMA you know ,COMMA I'm an older man now ;SEMICOLON I'm getting tired ,COMMA you know ;SEMICOLON I'm tired of spearing these oil workers .PERIOD <BREAK>
And this kid lived in the village -- he wasn't there at the time -- and this is the little movie he put together about that .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's a question of what's the continuity ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
We draw this set of nested spheres cut away so you see it .PERIOD <BREAK>
So if you take a picture of what's going on ,COMMA it's 10 years ago .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we go through a period of accelerating expansion ,COMMA and the universe expands and cools until it gets to the point where it becomes transparent ,COMMA then to the Dark Ages ,COMMA and then the first stars turn on ,COMMA and they evolve into galaxies ,COMMA and then later they get to the more expansive galaxies .PERIOD <BREAK>
I always think of space-time as being the real substance of space ,COMMA and the galaxies and the stars just like the foam on the ocean .PERIOD <BREAK>
And just put radially they're going out that way .PERIOD <BREAK>
What happens is ,COMMA you take pictures as the Earth rotates ,COMMA you get a fan across the sky .PERIOD <BREAK>
Do you see the fan-like scans made across the sky ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
So again ,COMMA you can see the extension of this Great Wall of galaxies showing up here .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we had to add one more thing to make the universe come out right .PERIOD <BREAK>
So I'll show you the next movie .PERIOD <BREAK>
We're going to keep zooming in .PERIOD OK .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so I forgot to tell you the scale .PERIOD <BREAK>
So it takes light three billion years to travel over that distance .PERIOD <BREAK>
There's a very simple fluid to begin with .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so you know when you first saw this picture ,COMMA it didn't mean quite so much to you .PERIOD <BREAK>
Here you're looking across one percent of the volume of the visible universe and you're seeing billions of galaxies ,COMMA right ,COMMA and nodes ,COMMA but you realize they're not even the main structure .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we're going to fly around ,COMMA and we'll fly around ,COMMA and you'll see occasionally a couple of filaments intersect ,COMMA and you get a large cluster of galaxies .PERIOD <BREAK>
So the question is ,COMMA how hard would it be to assemble this ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And so here we are .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is how ,COMMA if you took billions of years to go around ,COMMA it might look to you ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And if you could see invisible matter ,COMMA too .PERIOD <BREAK>
We're going to start and realize that the entire visible universe ,COMMA everything we can see in every direction with the Hubble Space Telescope plus our other instruments ,COMMA was once in a region that was smaller than an atom .PERIOD <BREAK>
So I'm going to show you one that can be run on a desktop in two days in the next picture .PERIOD <BREAK>
And at that point ,COMMA the universe mysteriously starts accelerating its expansion and cuts off the formation of larger-scale structure .PERIOD <BREAK>
The fact is that we're living longer .PERIOD <BREAK>
It really involves many different areas .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that's where the field is today .PERIOD <BREAK>
We then grow the cells outside the body ,COMMA take the scaffold ,COMMA coat the scaffold with the cells -- the patient's own cells ,COMMA two different cell types .PERIOD <BREAK>
So the strategy here is -- this is actually a CT scan ,COMMA an X-ray -- and we go layer by layer ,COMMA using computerized morphometric imaging analysis and 3 D reconstruction to get right down to those patient's own kidneys .PERIOD <BREAK>
And this is actually a new technology we're working on now .PERIOD <BREAK>
I was able to do more things .PERIOD <BREAK>
Most of my professors were all for it ,COMMA and they said ,COMMA Bring pictures and show me the clips online ,COMMA and I'm happy for you .PERIOD <BREAK>
'I failed' He cried .PERIOD <BREAK>
One was -- never be late .PERIOD Never be late .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's what he tried to teach me and my brothers at one time .PERIOD <BREAK>
He spelled Moriarty with only one 'i' .PERIOD <BREAK>
You and I know deeper down ,COMMA there's always a chance to win the crown .PERIOD <BREAK>
Giving all ,COMMA it seems to me ,COMMA is not so far from victory .PERIOD <BREAK>
Don't whine .PERIOD Don't complain .PERIOD Don't make excuses .PERIOD <BREAK>
Not necessary to what you would want them to be ,COMMA but they will be about what they should ,COMMA and only you will know whether you can do that .PERIOD <BREAK>
I mention in my book ,COMMA They Call Me Coach .PERIOD <BREAK>
So they had qualities that -- they came close to -- as close to reaching possibly their full potential as any players I ever had .PERIOD <BREAK>
So in other words ,COMMA what's happening here is that Swaptree solves my carrying company's sugar rush problem ,COMMA a problem the economists call the coincidence of wants ,COMMA in approximately 60 seconds .PERIOD <BREAK>
So what's happening here ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
We're bartering ,COMMA trading ,COMMA swapping ,COMMA sharing ,COMMA but they're being reinvented into dynamic and appealing forms .PERIOD <BREAK>
Over the next minute ,COMMA you're going to see a bit like a conceptual fireworks display of all the dots that went on in my head .PERIOD <BREAK>
I mean ,COMMA we're monkeys ,COMMA and we're born and bred to share and cooperate .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we were doing so for thousands of years ,COMMA whether it's when we hunted in packs ,COMMA or farmed in cooperatives ,COMMA before this big system called hyper-consumption came along and we built these fences and created out own little fiefdoms .PERIOD <BREAK>
They're growing up sharing -- files ,COMMA video games ,COMMA knowledge .PERIOD <BREAK>
Thomas Friedman is one of my favorite New York Times columnists ,COMMA and he poignantly commented that 2008 is when we hit a wall ,COMMA when Mother Nature and the market both said ,COMMA No more .PERIOD <BREAK>
The second is collaborative lifestyles .PERIOD <BREAK>
Just think of libraries and laundrettes .PERIOD <BREAK>
They are what I consider to be the cities of tomorrow ,COMMA the new urban world .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA why do I say that ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
After we finished ,COMMA Armstrong straightened his tie ,COMMA put on a wool sports jacket ,COMMA and we headed out into the glare .PERIOD <BREAK>
I thought they might be playing King of the Hill ,COMMA but I was wrong .PERIOD <BREAK>
'It's a simple life ,COMMA but nobody is restricting you .PERIOD <BREAK>
Beer is a very important thing in Brazil .PERIOD <BREAK>
This here ,COMMA on the right-hand side ,COMMA is what's called a -- if you look at the fine print under the awning -- it's a hotel .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the second aspect is that once you have 2000 people in the community ,COMMA you can petition the government to be recognized as a legal sub-municipality .PERIOD <BREAK>
My family moved ;SEMICOLON we're nomads .PERIOD <BREAK>
But these two people worked something out .PERIOD <BREAK>
Right now ,COMMA those and other neurologic diseases -- for which we have no cure or prevention -- cost about a third of a trillion dollars a year .PERIOD <BREAK>
It will be well over a trillion dollars by 2050 .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the Avian Flu is also not a good idea .PERIOD <BREAK>
You should also keep your blood pressure down ,COMMA because chronic high blood pressure is the biggest single risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease .PERIOD <BREAK>
And of course ,COMMA when it comes to cognitive effects ,COMMA use it or lose it applies ,COMMA so you want to stay mentally stimulated .PERIOD <BREAK>
And one of the first things that I started to investigate was the history of the name of technology .PERIOD <BREAK>
And obviously ,COMMA technology had existed before then ,COMMA but we weren't aware of it ,COMMA and so it was sort of an awakening of this force in our life .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that's the very first use of the word .PERIOD <BREAK>
Even the hunter-gatherers used some elementary tools .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA climate change is not a new thing .PERIOD <BREAK>
And flowers and plants are the same thing ,COMMA extended ,COMMA and technology is basically an extension of life .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the energy density that we see in the greatest of anywhere in the universe is actually in a PC chip .PERIOD <BREAK>
And there are things moving towards greater complexity ,COMMA moving towards greater diversity ,COMMA moving towards greater specialization ,COMMA sentience ,COMMA ubiquity and most important ,COMMA evolvability :COLON Those very same things are also present in technology .PERIOD <BREAK>
He could buy things that King Henry ,COMMA in all his wealth ,COMMA could never buy .PERIOD <BREAK>
And what I mean by that is that we find a new job for it .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA better ideas is really -- always the response to technology that we don't like is basically ,COMMA better technology .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so ,COMMA every technology is sort of a creative force looking for the right job .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we are aware of the price .PERIOD <BREAK>
Great movement that is starting billions of years ago is moving through us and it continues to go ,COMMA and our choice ,COMMA so to speak ,COMMA in technology ,COMMA is really to align ourselves with this force much greater than ourselves .PERIOD <BREAK>
I really appreciate your attention today .PERIOD Thank you .PERIOD <BREAK>
Neil and I were sitting there comparing how little we've slept in anticipation for this .PERIOD I've never been so nervous -- and I do this when I'm nervous ,COMMA I just realized .PERIOD <BREAK>
In the Brooklyn neighborhood that I lived in ,COMMA Park Slope ,COMMA there are a lot of writers -- it's like a very high per capita ratio of writers to normal people .PERIOD <BREAK>
So when I moved back to San Francisco ,COMMA we rented this building .PERIOD <BREAK>
So we thought ,COMMA We'll have all these writers and editors and everybody -- sort of a writing community -- coming into the office every day anyway ,COMMA why don't we just open up the front of the building for students to come in there after school ,COMMA get extra help on their written homework ,COMMA so you have basically no border between these two communities ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And we looked around and somebody else said ,COMMA Well ,COMMA you should sell supplies to the working buccaneer .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is replacement eyes in case you lose one .PERIOD <BREAK>
While you're reading the sign ,COMMA we pull a rope behind the counter and eight mop heads drop on your head .PERIOD <BREAK>
It became mop heads .PERIOD And this is the fish theater ,COMMA which is just a saltwater tank with three seats ,COMMA and then right behind it we set up this space ,COMMA which was the tutoring center .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we thought ,COMMA Oh ,COMMA they're going to storm the gates ,COMMA they're gonna love it .PERIOD And they didn't .PERIOD <BREAK>
You know ,COMMA it's been proven that 35 to 40 hours a year with one-on-one attention ,COMMA a student can get one grade level higher .PERIOD <BREAK>
But there was something psychological happening there that was just a little bit different .PERIOD <BREAK>
They're allowed to go home at 530 pm ,COMMA enjoy their family ,COMMA enjoy other hobbies ,COMMA get outside ,COMMA play .PERIOD <BREAK>
Then we said ,COMMA Well ,COMMA what are we going to do with the space during the day ,COMMA because it has to be used before 230 pm ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
So this is one of the books that they do .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA meanwhile ,COMMA there's an adult in the back typing this up ,COMMA taking it completely seriously ,COMMA which blows their mind .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's right off the library .PERIOD And there we serve all 529 kids in this middle school .PERIOD <BREAK>
You can see Amy Tan sponsored the next one ,COMMA I Might Get Somewhere .PERIOD <BREAK>
We sell all the student books .PERIOD <BREAK>
They would say ,COMMA What is this ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
So the store actually did really well .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is Sam Potts' great design that did this .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is a little vault -- you have to put your product in there ,COMMA it goes up an electric lift and then the guy behind the counter tells you that you have to recite the vow of heroism ,COMMA which you do ,COMMA if you want to buy anything .PERIOD And it limits ,COMMA really ,COMMA their sales .PERIOD <BREAK>
So then ,COMMA the secret door -- this is one of the shelves you don't see when you walk in ,COMMA but it slowly opens .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is one of the students ,COMMA Khaled Hamdan .PERIOD <BREAK>
Came in .PERIOD Got this concentrated attention .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'm going to switch to we ,COMMA and not I ,COMMA hope :COLON We hope that the attendees of this conference will usher in a new era of participation in our public schools .PERIOD <BREAK>
We hope that you will take the lead in partnering your innovative spirit and expertise with that of innovative educators in your community .PERIOD <BREAK>
Hot Studio did a great job in a very tight deadline .PERIOD So ,COMMA visit the site .PERIOD <BREAK>
I've been a priest in the Church for 20 years .PERIOD <BREAK>
Do we really believe that God is the kind of male boss that we've been presenting in our worship and in our liturgies over all these years ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Suggesting that God expresses Himself or Herself through powerlessness ,COMMA rather than power .PERIOD <BREAK>
Acknowledging that God is unknown and unknowable by definition .PERIOD <BREAK>
And this is what I said .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we want an explanation from God .PERIOD <BREAK>
For hundreds of years ,COMMA the prevailing orthodoxy ,COMMA the accepted truth ,COMMA was that God the Father ,COMMA the Creator ,COMMA is unchanging and therefore by definition cannot feel pain or sadness .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the devastating events of the 20 th century have forced people to question the cold ,COMMA unfeeling God .PERIOD <BREAK>
Who is God in all this ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Do we have a local God who can do little things like parking spaces ,COMMA but not big things like 500 mile-per-hour waves ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
That's just not acceptable to intelligent Christians ,COMMA and we must acknowledge it .PERIOD <BREAK>
You probably heard some of them :COLON the man who surfed the wave ,COMMA the teenage girl who recognized the danger because she had just been learning about tsunamis at school .PERIOD <BREAK>
If we believe something like this ,COMMA we must let go of the puppet-master completely ,COMMA take our leave of the almighty controller ,COMMA abandon traditional models .PERIOD <BREAK>
Maybe God isn't an agent like all of us are agents .PERIOD <BREAK>
The people knew their God by His mighty acts .PERIOD <BREAK>
In the incredible intricacy and magnificence of the natural world .PERIOD <BREAK>
In the end ,COMMA we have to say ,COMMA I don't know .PERIOD <BREAK>
To have faith in this God would be more like trusting an essential benevolence in the universe ,COMMA and less like believing a system of doctrinal statements .PERIOD <BREAK>
And how would one deepen such a faith ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
But in the end ,COMMA the only thing I could say for sure was ,COMMA I don't know ,COMMA and that just might be the most profoundly religious statement of all .PERIOD <BREAK>
It was deep at night .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I kept on staring at it until it disappeared .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is not a story of a nameless survivor of war ,COMMA and nameless refugees ,COMMA whose stereotypical images we see in our newspapers and our TV with tattered clothes ,COMMA dirty face ,COMMA scared eyes .PERIOD <BREAK>
War ,COMMA a friend of mine said ,COMMA is not about sound at all .PERIOD <BREAK>
It is actually about silence ,COMMA the silence of humanity .PERIOD <BREAK>
I have since left Iraq and founded a group called Women for Women International that ends up working with women survivors of wars .PERIOD <BREAK>
She said ,COMMA But it's not fair ,COMMA because there is only one life ,COMMA and there should only be one death .PERIOD <BREAK>
Ninety percent of modern war casualties are civilians .PERIOD <BREAK>
How interesting .PERIOD <BREAK>
There is a side that is led by men ,COMMA and there is a side that is led by women .PERIOD <BREAK>
There is no way we can talk about the building of stability if we don't start investing in women and girls .PERIOD <BREAK>
She got into Women for Women International's program .PERIOD <BREAK>
To start with ,COMMA these women that I told you about are dancing and singing every single day ,COMMA and if they can ,COMMA who are we not to dance ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
By accepting this dichotomy ,COMMA whether it's tongue-in-cheek ,COMMA when we attempt to accommodate it in our world ,COMMA and we try to build our foundation for the world ,COMMA we're messing up the future ,COMMA because ,COMMA who wants to be uncreative ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Now I grew up in the ' 60 s and I'll admit it ,COMMA actually ,COMMA my childhood spanned the ' 60 s ,COMMA and I was a wannabe hippie and I always resented the fact that I wasn't really old enough to be a hippie .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I know there are people here ,COMMA the younger generation who want to be hippies ,COMMA but people talk about the ' 60 s all the time ,COMMA and they talk about the anarchy that was there ,COMMA but when I think about the ' 60 s ,COMMA what I took away from it was that there was hope for the future .PERIOD <BREAK>
You see ,COMMA I always assumed I would go into space ,COMMA because I followed all of this ,COMMA but I also loved the arts and sciences .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA my mother helped me figure that one out .PERIOD <BREAK>
But when I went into space ,COMMA when I went into space I carried a number of things up with me .PERIOD I carried a poster by Alvin Ailey ,COMMA which you can figure out now ,COMMA I love the dance company .PERIOD <BREAK>
And yeah ,COMMA sub-atomic physics is deconstructive .PERIOD You literally try to tear atoms apart to understand what's inside of them .PERIOD But sculpture ,COMMA from what I understand from great sculptors ,COMMA is deconstructive ,COMMA because you see a piece and you remove what doesn't need to be there .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's the universe ,COMMA as experienced by everyone ,COMMA and the arts manifest our desire ,COMMA our attempt to share or influence others through experiences that are peculiar to us as individuals .PERIOD <BREAK>
Do you know these books ,COMMA these such and such For Dummies ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
But I was looking online at Amazoncom for other books like this .PERIOD <BREAK>
There's a sort of business model around being stupid in some sense .PERIOD <BREAK>
I was in Milan last week ,COMMA for the Italian launch .PERIOD <BREAK>
So it was traumatizing ,COMMA actually .PERIOD <BREAK>
Modernism means white box ,COMMA and it's a perfect white box .PERIOD <BREAK>
I have a default title as a father of a bunch of daughters .PERIOD <BREAK>
As a child ,COMMA we used to wake up at 1 am .PERIOD and work till 6 pm ,COMMA six days a week .PERIOD <BREAK>
Thank you .PERIOD <BREAK>
But the Media Lab is an interesting place ,COMMA and it's important to me because as a student ,COMMA I was a computer science undergrad ,COMMA and I discovered design later on in my life .PERIOD <BREAK>
And there was this person ,COMMA Muriel Cooper .PERIOD <BREAK>
It was the best advice I ever got .PERIOD So I went to art school ,COMMA because of her .PERIOD <BREAK>
I think that the mentors that we all meet sort of humanize us .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA if you sort of compare that ,COMMA like this ,COMMA you'll see that computer versus human -- I've been tracking this for the last year -- computer versus human over the last year has changed .PERIOD <BREAK>
I spent my entire early career making complex stuff .PERIOD <BREAK>
Lots of complex stuff .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is a floral theme calendar in 1997 ,COMMA and this is a firework calendar .PERIOD So ,COMMA you launch the number into space ,COMMA because the Japanese believe that when you see fireworks ,COMMA you're cooler for some reason .PERIOD <BREAK>
I've been lucky to have been there before people made these kind of things ,COMMA and so I made all this kind of stuff that messes with your eyes .PERIOD <BREAK>
And eye meat is something different ,COMMA something more fibrous ,COMMA something more powerful ,COMMA perhaps .PERIOD But what could that be ,COMMA eye meat ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
So ,COMMA I went back to the computer ,COMMA and I bought five large fries ,COMMA and scanned them all .PERIOD And I was looking for some kind of food theme ,COMMA and I wrote some software to automatically lay out french-fry images .PERIOD <BREAK>
And also ,COMMA as a child ,COMMA I was the fattest kid in class ,COMMA so I used to love Cheetos .PERIOD Oh ,COMMA I love Cheetos ,COMMA yummy .PERIOD <BREAK>
I discovered that Cheetos are good ,COMMA expressive material .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's a strange business model .PERIOD I can come into work everyday and staple five pieces of paper and just stare at it with my latte .PERIOD <BREAK>
In Japan ,COMMA they say that sushi is challenging .PERIOD <BREAK>
This book I wrote because I want to figure out life .PERIOD <BREAK>
He's an expert in aging .PERIOD This horizontal axis is how old you are -- twelve years old ,COMMA twenty-four years old ,COMMA seventy-four ,COMMA ninety-six years old -- and this is some medical data .PERIOD So ,COMMA brain strength increases up to 60 ,COMMA and then after 60 ,COMMA it sort of goes down .PERIOD Kind of depressing in a way .PERIOD <BREAK>
Your social responsibility is very interesting .PERIOD <BREAK>
How dare we be optimistic ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
But ,COMMA as important as it is to change the lightbulbs ,COMMA it is more important to change the laws .PERIOD <BREAK>
And there are lots of those .PERIOD But the climate crisis is the rare but all-important global ,COMMA or strategic ,COMMA conflict .PERIOD <BREAK>
Greenland remains .PERIOD Twenty-eight years ago ,COMMA this is what the polar ice cap -- the North Polar ice cap -- looked like at the end of the summer ,COMMA at the fall equinox .PERIOD <BREAK>
This last fall ,COMMA I went to the Snow and Ice Data Center in Boulder ,COMMA Colorado ,COMMA and talked to the researchers here in Monterey at the Naval Postgraduate Laboratory .PERIOD <BREAK>
The North Polar ice cap is the same size geographically -- doesn't look quite the same size -- but it is exactly the same size as the United States ,COMMA minus an area roughly equal to the state of Arizona .PERIOD <BREAK>
They have exactly the same amount of carbon .PERIOD <BREAK>
What is missing is a sense of urgency .PERIOD <BREAK>
NBC -- I'll show all of the networks here -- the top journalists for NBC asked 956 questions in 2007 of the presidential candidates :COLON two of them were about the climate crisis .PERIOD ABC :COLON 844 questions ,COMMA two about the climate crisis .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is gasoline consumption in all of these countries .PERIOD And us .PERIOD <BREAK>
We have the technologies .PERIOD <BREAK>
We have to have a unified view of how to go about this :COLON the struggle against poverty in the world and the challenge of cutting wealthy country emissions ,COMMA all has a single ,COMMA very simple solution .PERIOD <BREAK>
But responses can actually make a huge difference in the poor countries .PERIOD This is a proposal that has been talked about a lot in Europe .PERIOD <BREAK>
Lot of other things contributed to it ,COMMA but the new Prime Minister announced that his very first priority would be to change Australia's position on Kyoto ,COMMA and he has .PERIOD Now ,COMMA they came to an awareness partly because of the horrible drought that they have had .PERIOD <BREAK>
But we have a planetary emergency .PERIOD <BREAK>
If we had just one week's worth of what we spend on the Iraq War ,COMMA we could be well on the way to solving this challenge .PERIOD <BREAK>
This challenge is part of the fabric of our whole civilization .PERIOD <BREAK>
Demand -- change the light bulbs ,COMMA but change the laws .PERIOD Change the global treaties .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA nobody is talking on that scale .PERIOD But I do believe that between now and November ,COMMA it is possible .PERIOD <BREAK>
In terms of your own personal role going forward ,COMMA Al ,COMMA is there something more than that you would like to be doing ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Al Gore ,COMMA thank you so much for coming to TED .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that's certainly how it seemed to me when I started this project .PERIOD <BREAK>
All this noise around us actually has information .PERIOD <BREAK>
So what I started thinking was ,COMMA perhaps there is something like open source intelligence here .PERIOD <BREAK>
So we started doing this .PERIOD And you can see here on the horizontal axis you've got the number of people killed in an attack or the size of the attack .PERIOD <BREAK>
You take all of the conflict ,COMMA all of the chaos ,COMMA all of the noise ,COMMA and out of that comes this precise mathematical distribution of the way attacks are ordered in this conflict .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we found that not only were the distributions these straight lines ,COMMA but the slope of these lines ,COMMA they clustered around this value of alpha equals 25 .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we could generate an equation that could predict the likelihood of an attack .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is data ,COMMA statistics .PERIOD What does it tell us about these conflicts ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Turns out we kind of do a reasonable job .PERIOD <BREAK>
So what's going on ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Why should these different -- seemingly different conflicts have the same patterns ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
What does it look like ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
We can push it up :COLON the forces become more fragmented ;SEMICOLON there is more of them ,COMMA but they are weaker .PERIOD <BREAK>
The opposite happened .PERIOD <BREAK>
The groups became stronger .PERIOD <BREAK>
But designers are great at taking big revolutions that happen and transforming them so that we can use them .PERIOD <BREAK>
You work over different time zones ,COMMA you talk to very different people ,COMMA you multitask .PERIOD We all know it ,COMMA and we do it kind of automatically .PERIOD <BREAK>
And all of a sudden scientists are seeking designers ,COMMA just like designers are seeking scientists .PERIOD <BREAK>
And Keith has come ,COMMA and also Jonathan has come and many others .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it was great ,COMMA because at the beginning was this apology fest -- you know ,COMMA scientists would tell designers ,COMMA you know ,COMMA I don't know what style is ,COMMA I'm not really elegant .PERIOD <BREAK>
Paul Steinhardt ,COMMA a physicist from New York ,COMMA and Aranda/Lasch ,COMMA architects ,COMMA collaborated in an installation in London at the Serpentine .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'm showing to you different sections of the show right now ,COMMA just to give you a taste of it .PERIOD <BREAK>
In this case I'm showing more the designers' work ,COMMA because they're the ones that have really been stimulated .PERIOD <BREAK>
But the problem is that it's a really ugly patty .PERIOD <BREAK>
When you don't have to kill cows and it can have any shape ,COMMA what should it be like ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
One of the most important topics of the show -- you know ,COMMA as anything in our life today ,COMMA we can look at it from many ,COMMA many different viewpoints ,COMMA and at different levels .PERIOD <BREAK>
One of the most interesting and most important concepts is the idea of scale .PERIOD We change scale very often :COLON we change resolution of screens ,COMMA and we're not really fazed by it ,COMMA we do it very comfortably .PERIOD <BREAK>
You can be in the subway and you can be completely isolated and have your own room in your iPod .PERIOD <BREAK>
Again ,COMMA this communal sense of experience that seems to be so important today .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so this student at the RCA designed this beautiful blown-glass object where the bees move from one chamber to the other if they detect that particular smell that signifies ,COMMA in this case ,COMMA pregnancy .PERIOD <BREAK>
Design for Debate is a very interesting new endeavor that designers have really shaped for themselves .PERIOD <BREAK>
And usually they are accompanied by videos .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's quite amazing how these things can make you smile ,COMMA can make you laugh ,COMMA can make you cry sometimes .PERIOD <BREAK>
Thank you very much .PERIOD <BREAK>
The only trouble is the people next door ;SEMICOLON I can't stand them .PERIOD <BREAK>
And yet ,COMMA if I just allowed myself to be overwhelmed by these feelings ,COMMA I wouldn't be doing my job -- because I have to actually be there for them and make sure that rituals happen ,COMMA that practicalities are seen to .PERIOD <BREAK>
Who cannot be touched by compassion when we see the terrible horrors of the results of war ,COMMA or famine ,COMMA or earthquakes ,COMMA or tsunamis ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And ,COMMA of course ,COMMA you can't do that unless you understand yourself a bit more .PERIOD <BREAK>
Therefore ,COMMA there should be justice throughout the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA like Snoopy ,COMMA we can't just lie there and think great thoughts about our neighbors .PERIOD <BREAK>
There has to be a willingness to do good deeds ,COMMA but not ,COMMA of course ,COMMA at the expense of our own sanity .PERIOD <BREAK>
What does this compassion entail ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And ,COMMA as many people do ,COMMA he was dozing off during the sermon .PERIOD <BREAK>
And he rushed home .PERIOD And after the Sabbath ,COMMA he made 12 loaves of bread ,COMMA took them to the synagogue ,COMMA went into the synagogue ,COMMA opened the ark and said ,COMMA God ,COMMA I don't know why you want this bread ,COMMA but here you are .PERIOD <BREAK>
And he called the two of them to his office .PERIOD <BREAK>
You mean God didn't want my bread ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And the rabbi said ,COMMA You've misunderstood me .PERIOD <BREAK>
You've misunderstood totally ,COMMA he said .PERIOD <BREAK>
Please keep your seat .PERIOD <BREAK>
Wrap it in an ACE bandage ,COMMA take some ibuprofen for a week or two ,COMMA and that's the end of the story .PERIOD <BREAK>
How can the nervous system get this so wrong ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
In your house ,COMMA wires run in the wall ,COMMA from the light switch to a junction box in the ceiling and from the junction box to the light bulb .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's almost as if somebody came into your home and rewired your walls so that the next time you turned on the light switch ,COMMA the toilet flushed three doors down ,COMMA or your dishwasher went on ,COMMA or your computer monitor turned off .PERIOD <BREAK>
If you look out your window and you can see Long's Peak ,COMMA you're probably familiar with it .PERIOD <BREAK>
Take Meeker ,COMMA Mt .PERIOD Meeker .PERIOD Lump that in there ,COMMA and put that in space as well ,COMMA and Mt .PERIOD Everest ,COMMA and K 2 ,COMMA and the Indian peaks .PERIOD <BREAK>
Because back then ,COMMA video cameras were just starting to become popular ,COMMA and people would bring them ,COMMA parents would bring them ,COMMA to their kids' football games to film their kids play football .PERIOD And since this came in on a Friday ,COMMA they were able to get this great footage of this thing breaking up as it came in over West Virgina ,COMMA Maryland ,COMMA Pennsylvania and New Jersey until it did that to a car in New York .PERIOD <BREAK>
This did a huge amount of damage .PERIOD <BREAK>
The one over Tunguska was probably made of rock ,COMMA and that's much more crumbly ,COMMA so it blew up in the air .PERIOD Either way ,COMMA these are tremendous explosions ,COMMA 20 megatons .PERIOD <BREAK>
I don't think Apophis is a problem .PERIOD <BREAK>
In fact ,COMMA Apophis is a blessing in disguise ,COMMA because it woke us up to the dangers of these things .PERIOD <BREAK>
Well ,COMMA let me ask you ,COMMA what happens if you're standing in the middle of the road and a car's headed for you ?QUESTIONMARK What do you do ?QUESTIONMARK You do this .PERIOD <BREAK>
I think even NASA can do that ,COMMA and they proved that they can .PERIOD <BREAK>
After the big macho Rrrrrrr BAM !EXCLAMATIONMARK We're gonna hit this thing in the face ,COMMA then we bring in the velvet gloves .PERIOD <BREAK>
There's a group of scientists and engineers and astronauts and they call themselves The B 612 Foundation .PERIOD For those of you who've read The Little Prince ,COMMA you understand that reference ,COMMA I hope .PERIOD The little prince who lived on an asteroid ,COMMA it was called B 612 .PERIOD <BREAK>
So think about this ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Now those of you who are lucky enough to live in those societies that represent 17 percent ,COMMA I think should enjoy it until it lasts .PERIOD <BREAK>
My story starts -- the story I want to share -- starts in 1991 .PERIOD <BREAK>
The problem was that we had to re-tape that history a week later ;SEMICOLON because if we did not ,COMMA we could not afford enough tapes to keep archives of that history .PERIOD <BREAK>
So here we are having our first client ,COMMA brilliant .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's a kind of very nice ,COMMA sophisticated way how to economically strangle a daily newspaper .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we said ,COMMA that's fine ;SEMICOLON let's meet ;SEMICOLON you'll bring us your business plan ,COMMA which eventually they did .PERIOD <BREAK>
We start the meeting .PERIOD <BREAK>
But however you put it ,COMMA you know ,COMMA the numbers do not make any sense .PERIOD <BREAK>
We were the best that they could do .PERIOD <BREAK>
We do it in 17 countries of the developing world .PERIOD <BREAK>
So what the governor got was an empty shell .PERIOD <BREAK>
So from that perspective ,COMMA what we did is just really one drop in the sea of that need that we can identify .PERIOD <BREAK>
Imagine two thirds over here running excellent organizations ,COMMA doing very important work .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now imagine that every second person over here is deaf ,COMMA does not hear ,COMMA and switch the lights off .PERIOD <BREAK>
So we thought that some kind of a big idea is needed to reform ,COMMA to totally rethink fundraising .PERIOD <BREAK>
And then two weeks later ,COMMA Iqbal Quadir can issue his electricity in Bangladesh bonds .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA indeed ,COMMA I have spent my life looking into the lives of presidents who are no longer alive .PERIOD <BREAK>
So since I tell stories ,COMMA let me look back on the lives of two of the presidents I've studied to illustrate this point -- Abraham Lincoln and Lyndon Johnson .PERIOD <BREAK>
But he read books in every spare moment he could find .PERIOD <BREAK>
Three things had combined to lay him low .PERIOD <BREAK>
He was so depressed that friends worried he was suicidal .PERIOD <BREAK>
And his great friend Speed went to his side and said ,COMMA Lincoln ,COMMA you must rally or you will die .PERIOD <BREAK>
And with a beauty of language -- almost as if the Shakespeare and the poetry he had so loved as a child had worked their way into his very soul .PERIOD <BREAK>
Knowing that Tolstoy was in their midst ,COMMA they asked him to tell stories of the great men of history .PERIOD <BREAK>
But instead ,COMMA surprisingly ,COMMA he said ,COMMA Oh ,COMMA bring her down here for a year ,COMMA and if I can't win her over ,COMMA no one can .PERIOD <BREAK>
But they were great ,COMMA nonetheless .PERIOD <BREAK>
But I also worried that part of it was that I was then a young woman .PERIOD <BREAK>
And there was wine and cheese and a red-checked tablecloth -- all the romantic trappings .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the British people were still upset about losing the Revolution ,COMMA so they decided to embarrass him a little bit by putting a huge picture of General Washington in the only outhouse ,COMMA where he'd have to encounter it .PERIOD <BREAK>
Which allows me ,COMMA from the beginning of spring training to the end of the fall ,COMMA to have something to occupy my mind and heart other than my work .PERIOD <BREAK>
But it so happened he was speaking in a Protestant Church .PERIOD <BREAK>
So I went to my father in tears ,COMMA What are we going to do ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
I tried to sandwich it in between talking too much in church ,COMMA wishing harm to others ,COMMA being mean to my sisters .PERIOD <BREAK>
Well ,COMMA here's an example from my own experience .PERIOD <BREAK>
There are lots of people who believe that ,COMMA and I think it is utter baloney .PERIOD <BREAK>
I think that's the main point to be made .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I won't go into a lot of stuff about quantum mechanics and what it's like ,COMMA and so on .PERIOD <BREAK>
There are even movies about it with a lot of wrong stuff .PERIOD <BREAK>
And in a lot of familiar cases ,COMMA they of course are .PERIOD <BREAK>
So it's not a theory of everything .PERIOD And in fact ,COMMA a huge amount of the information in the universe around us comes from those accidents ,COMMA and not just from the fundamental laws .PERIOD <BREAK>
You know what it means .PERIOD A circle ,COMMA for example ,COMMA is symmetric under rotations about the center of the circle .PERIOD <BREAK>
Maxwell's equations are of course symmetrical under rotations of all of space .PERIOD <BREAK>
The next -- second -- equation says that there is no magnetism other than that .PERIOD <BREAK>
So here we say ,COMMA again ,COMMA what we said before :COLON that each skin of the onion shows a similarity to the adjoining skins .PERIOD <BREAK>
And therefore it looks beautiful because we already know how to write it in a lovely ,COMMA concise way .PERIOD <BREAK>
Steps toward unification exhibit the simplicity .PERIOD <BREAK>
Symmetry exhibits the simplicity .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA who today would claim that as a mere conceit of the human mind ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
They are what we call emergent properties .PERIOD <BREAK>
You don't need -- you don't need something more to get something more .PERIOD <BREAK>
Life can emerge from physics and chemistry ,COMMA plus a lot of accidents .PERIOD <BREAK>
The things we make have one supreme quality -- they live longer than us .PERIOD <BREAK>
We perish ,COMMA they survive ;SEMICOLON we have one life ,COMMA they have many lives ,COMMA and in each life they can mean different things .PERIOD <BREAK>
The central element ,COMMA still ,COMMA of the notion of return ,COMMA a central part of the life of Judaism .PERIOD <BREAK>
All of those are respected by Cyrus .PERIOD <BREAK>
It left a dream of the Middle East as a unit ,COMMA and a unit where people of different faiths could live together .PERIOD <BREAK>
For them ,COMMA of course ,COMMA it can't possibly by Marduk that made all this happen .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it's quite clear the cylinder is older than the text of Isaiah ,COMMA and yet ,COMMA Jehovah is speaking in words very similar to those used by Marduk .PERIOD <BREAK>
The state of Israel is setup ,COMMA and 50 years later ,COMMA in the late 60 s ,COMMA it's clear that Britain's role as the imperial power is over .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's shown being presented here ,COMMA put into its case by the director of the National Museum of Tehran ,COMMA one of the many women in Iran in very senior positions ,COMMA Mrs .PERIOD Ardakani .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it's the subject of a huge debate about what this cylinder means ,COMMA what Cyrus means ,COMMA but above all ,COMMA Cyrus as articulated through this cylinder -- Cyrus as the defender of the homeland ,COMMA the champion ,COMMA of course ,COMMA of Iranian identity and of the Iranian peoples ,COMMA tolerant of all faiths .PERIOD <BREAK>
Will Iran set free the people that the tyrants have enslaved and expropriated ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
A replica of this is at the United Nations .PERIOD <BREAK>
But I think it's possible that the most powerful and the wisest voice of all of them may well be the voice of this mute thing ,COMMA the Cyrus cylinder .PERIOD <BREAK>
Making sense of those things is a very difficult thing to do .PERIOD <BREAK>
In fact ,COMMA I have got qualifications .PERIOD <BREAK>
So I started thinking about peace ,COMMA and I was obviously ,COMMA as I said to you ,COMMA very much moved by these images ,COMMA trying to make sense of that .PERIOD <BREAK>
Could I go and speak to older and wiser people who would tell me how they made sense of the things that are going on ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And that was when I had the idea .PERIOD <BREAK>
There was no day of global unity .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that's why we wanted it to be the 21 st of September as the date of peace .PERIOD <BREAK>
Could you give me a flight ?QUESTIONMARK Because we're going to go see him .PERIOD <BREAK>
And of course ,COMMA we went and saw him and it was amazing .PERIOD <BREAK>
And just staying in the moment with it was a beautiful thing and really empowering actually .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we were listening to everybody .PERIOD <BREAK>
and working with NGOs and building this case .PERIOD <BREAK>
I felt that I was presenting a case on behalf of the global community to try and create this day .PERIOD <BREAK>
And this young child who'd taken about an inch and a half out of her leg with no antiseptic ,COMMA and that young boy who was a child soldier ,COMMA who told me he'd killed people -- he was about 12 -- these things made me realize that this was not a film that I could just stop .PERIOD <BREAK>
If this is the only film that I ever make ,COMMA I'm going to document until this becomes a reality .PERIOD <BREAK>
The Costa Rican government and the British government had put forward to the United Nations General Assembly ,COMMA with 54 co-sponsors ,COMMA the idea of the first ever Ceasefire Nonviolence Day ,COMMA the 21 st of September ,COMMA as a fixed calendar date ,COMMA and it was unanimously adopted by every head of state in the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
And as I mentioned ,COMMA when it started ,COMMA we were at the Globe ,COMMA and there was no press .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's been created ;SEMICOLON nobody knows .PERIOD <BREAK>
But we have to continue this journey ,COMMA and we have to tell people ,COMMA and we have to prove it can work .PERIOD <BREAK>
And after lots and lots of meetings obviously ,COMMA I'm delighted that this man ,COMMA Ahmad Fawzi ,COMMA one of my heroes and mentors really ,COMMA he managed to get UNICEF involved .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I saw him because he was an actor ,COMMA I was an actor ,COMMA I had a connection to him ,COMMA because we needed to get to the press ,COMMA we needed this attraction ,COMMA we needed the media to be involved .PERIOD <BREAK>
Because if we start pumping it up a bit maybe more people would listen and there'd be more -- when we got into certain areas ,COMMA maybe there would be more people interested .PERIOD <BREAK>
I won't go into that .PERIOD <BREAK>
So Jude said ,COMMA Okay ,COMMA I'll do some statements for you .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I could sort of see a little look in his eye of interest .PERIOD <BREAK>
So these guys were absolutely crucial .PERIOD <BREAK>
This amazing woman ,COMMA Fatima Gailani ,COMMA was absolutely instrumental in what went on as she was the spokesperson for the resistance against the Russians .PERIOD <BREAK>
And her Afghan network was just absolutely everywhere .PERIOD <BREAK>
We will observe this day .PERIOD <BREAK>
We see it as a window of opportunity .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so then we wrapped the film up and we put it together because we had to go back .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we wanted to go back and show them the film and say ,COMMA Look ,COMMA you guys made this possible .PERIOD And thank you very much .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I kept thinking about this 70 percent .PERIOD <BREAK>
70 percent reduction in violence -- in what everyone said was completely impossible and you couldn't do .PERIOD <BREAK>
He's an amazing man .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's all about the individuals .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it then made me think about a glass of water ,COMMA which is clear .PERIOD <BREAK>
Thank you very much .PERIOD Thank you .PERIOD <BREAK>
There was not a flashlight ,COMMA not a lantern ,COMMA not a candle -- pitch black .PERIOD <BREAK>
Anesthetic wears off .PERIOD The patient feels pain .PERIOD <BREAK>
And her recommendation is take this opportunity to fire everyone ,COMMA start all over again .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now what does this have to do with leadership ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
They are the elite .PERIOD They are our leaders .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we need to train them right .PERIOD <BREAK>
And one day I go to the airport to meet my father ,COMMA and as I walk up this grassy slope from the car park to the terminal building ,COMMA I'm stopped by two soldiers wielding AK- 47 assault weapons .PERIOD <BREAK>
So a few years after this event ,COMMA I leave Ghana on a scholarship to go to Swarthmore College for my education .PERIOD <BREAK>
They wanted us to be analytical .PERIOD <BREAK>
They wanted us to be concerned about social issues .PERIOD <BREAK>
It was brilliant .PERIOD <BREAK>
Somebody trained them to do the work that they do .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA we cannot achieve perfection ,COMMA but if we reach for it ,COMMA then we can achieve excellence .PERIOD <BREAK>
I don't know ultimately what they will do .PERIOD <BREAK>
But the conversation they're having now -- about what their good society should look like ,COMMA what their excellent society should look like ,COMMA is a really good thing .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA I just wanted to leave that slide up because it's important that we think about it .PERIOD <BREAK>
I am even more thrilled by the fact that least year our student body elected a woman to be the head of Student Government .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's the first time in the history of Ghana that a woman has been elected head of Student Government at any university .PERIOD <BREAK>
It says a lot about her peers who elected her .PERIOD <BREAK>
My job is to make arms and legs -- well it's not completely true .PERIOD <BREAK>
And then ,COMMA not only for war victims ,COMMA but it was for any kind of patient .PERIOD <BREAK>
I was also working in the orthopedic center ,COMMA we call it .PERIOD <BREAK>
But it was a terrific job .PERIOD <BREAK>
So the orthopedic center was closed because physical rehabilitation was not considered a priority .PERIOD <BREAK>
Anyway ,COMMA you know every time I make this speech -- it's not the first time -- but it's an emotion .PERIOD <BREAK>
I wanted to go home .PERIOD I was driving .PERIOD <BREAK>
And everybody disappeared from the street .PERIOD <BREAK>
The man was without legs and only with one arm .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I ask ,COMMA What are you doing out in the street in this situation ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And then I said ,COMMA Oh ,COMMA my God .PERIOD What did I say ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
He was coming every day ,COMMA crossing the front line .PERIOD <BREAK>
Two groups of Mujahideen started fighting .PERIOD <BREAK>
So we dashed ,COMMA all of us ,COMMA towards the shelter .PERIOD <BREAK>
Everybody was grabbing something .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I will never forget Mahmoud and his son walking together pushing the empty wheelchair .PERIOD <BREAK>
I don't want them to be teased at school by the other students .PERIOD <BREAK>
I said ,COMMA Okay .PERIOD <BREAK>
And then he sat down .PERIOD <BREAK>
So the only things I could manage to obtain was a kind of a compromise .PERIOD <BREAK>
I understood that I was wrong again .PERIOD <BREAK>
And then we started a new policy -- a new policy completely different .PERIOD <BREAK>
We decided to employ as many disabled as possible to train them in any possible job .PERIOD <BREAK>
I said ,COMMA No ,COMMA no ,COMMA no ,COMMA no ,COMMA we can't .PERIOD <BREAK>
And you should see me during the match .PERIOD <BREAK>
I shout like a true Italian .PERIOD <BREAK>
In this image of the Tokyo skyline ,COMMA I've hidden data from the newest planet-hunting space telescope on the block ,COMMA the Kepler Mission .PERIOD <BREAK>
There we go .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we can measure this very ,COMMA very precisely with Kepler and trace their effects .PERIOD <BREAK>
Wrong .PERIOD I'm not looking at you .PERIOD I can't see you .PERIOD <BREAK>
I have to do something now ,COMMA which seems a little bit strange for a magician .PERIOD <BREAK>
Oh ,COMMA they gladly sell you that ,COMMA yes .PERIOD <BREAK>
But the one thing that has made a big comeback just recently is this business of speaking with the dead .PERIOD <BREAK>
I don't think so ,COMMA because this subculture of people use exactly the same gimmicks that we magicians do ,COMMA exactly the same -- the same physical methods ,COMMA the same psychological methods -- and they effectively and profoundly deceive millions of people around the earth ,COMMA to their detriment .PERIOD <BREAK>
Good bye .PERIOD <BREAK>
The second question that I'd like to ask ,COMMA rather simple :COLON Suppose I ask them to contact the spirit of my deceased father-in-law ,COMMA as an example .PERIOD <BREAK>
Is this a hunting game ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
But it is a cruel ,COMMA vicious ,COMMA absolutely conscienceless -- I'll be all right ,COMMA keep your seats -- game that these people play .PERIOD <BREAK>
Folks ,COMMA that's what dying is all about !EXCLAMATIONMARK <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA it may bring a certain amount of comfort ,COMMA but that comfort lasts only about 20 minutes or so .PERIOD <BREAK>
We all know who he is on television .PERIOD <BREAK>
He's well educated ,COMMA he's smart ,COMMA he knows what Sylvia Browne is doing but he doesn't give a damn .PERIOD <BREAK>
Because ,COMMA the bottom line is ,COMMA the sponsors love it ,COMMA and he will expose her to television publicity all the time .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA without that ,COMMA how could we possibly function ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
She gives you the names of previous lives ,COMMA who you were in previous lives .PERIOD <BREAK>
Duh .PERIOD <BREAK>
Nothing is ever said about a 14 year-old bootblack in the streets of London who died of consumption .PERIOD <BREAK>
All the more reason to take the million dollars ,COMMA wouldn't you think ,COMMA Sylvia ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Why don't they affect me ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Now folks ,COMMA this is not just a metaphor I'm going to give you now ,COMMA it's true .PERIOD <BREAK>
And another claim that they make -- you'll love this one -- the more dilute the medicine is ,COMMA they say ,COMMA the more powerful it is .PERIOD <BREAK>
Largely ,COMMA it's the media who are to blame for this sort of thing .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's the bottom line ,COMMA the dollar line .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA we've offered this carrot ,COMMA as I say ,COMMA we've dangled the carrot .PERIOD <BREAK>
Ladies and gentlemen ,COMMA I'm James Randi ,COMMA and I'm waiting .PERIOD <BREAK>
And one of the major gaps in care ,COMMA almost across the board ,COMMA is access to safe surgery .PERIOD <BREAK>
In the background there is a very sophisticated anesthesia machine .PERIOD <BREAK>
In order to operate ,COMMA this machine needs a number of things that this hospital has to offer .PERIOD <BREAK>
And finally ,COMMA I think you can see that infrastructure is not very strong .PERIOD <BREAK>
Similarly compressed oxygen and other medical supplies are really a luxury and can often be out of stock for months or even a year .PERIOD <BREAK>
One of our partners at Johns Hopkins was observing surgeries in Sierra Leone about a year ago .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the first surgery of the day happened to be an obstetrical case .PERIOD <BREAK>
And everything began pretty auspiciously .PERIOD <BREAK>
My colleague ,COMMA Dr .PERIOD Paul Fenton ,COMMA was living this reality .PERIOD <BREAK>
He went to work every day in an operating theater like this one ,COMMA trying to deliver anesthesia and teach others how to do so using that same equipment that became so unreliable ,COMMA and frankly unsafe ,COMMA in his hospital .PERIOD <BREAK>
But this gives control to the provider ,COMMA whether there's power or not ,COMMA because they can adjust the flow based on the percentage of oxygen they see that they're giving their patient .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is in 13 hospitals in four countries ,COMMA and since 2010 ,COMMA we've done well over 2000 surgeries with no clinically adverse events .PERIOD <BREAK>
So we're thrilled .PERIOD <BREAK>
Because only once before has the fate of individual people and the fate of all of humanity been so intertwined .PERIOD <BREAK>
Maybe a few lung diseases here and there ,COMMA but ,COMMA you know ,COMMA that's not such a big deal .PERIOD <BREAK>
But back to animals and junk food .PERIOD <BREAK>
Two :COLON both have been marketed heavily ,COMMA creating unnatural demand .PERIOD <BREAK>
And they do this here .PERIOD It's the same deal .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's just the United States .PERIOD <BREAK>
There were no restaurant chains .PERIOD <BREAK>
Fats ,COMMA carbs ,COMMA proteins -- they weren't bad or good ,COMMA they were food .PERIOD <BREAK>
The South and West became agricultural hubs ,COMMA and in other parts of the country ,COMMA suburbs took over farmland .PERIOD <BREAK>
If we had a slide of Salisbury steak ,COMMA even more so ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Thanks to farm subsidies ,COMMA the fine collaboration between agribusiness and Congress ,COMMA soy ,COMMA corn and cattle became king .PERIOD <BREAK>
Not that they were any good ,COMMA but they were there .PERIOD <BREAK>
For dessert ,COMMA store-bought ice cream or cookies .PERIOD <BREAK>
So now ,COMMA you've got your pizza nights ,COMMA you've got your microwave nights ,COMMA you've got your grazing nights ,COMMA you've got your fend-for-yourself nights and so on .PERIOD <BREAK>
Meat ,COMMA junk food ,COMMA cheese :COLON the very stuff that will kill you .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA now we clamor for organic food .PERIOD <BREAK>
I don't know .PERIOD <BREAK>
Ann Cooper's right .PERIOD <BREAK>
The USDA is not our ally here .PERIOD <BREAK>
Cruelty :COLON I knew that the 10 billion animals we raise each year for meat are raised in factory farm conditions that we ,COMMA hypocritically ,COMMA wouldn't even consider for our own cats ,COMMA dogs and other pets .PERIOD <BREAK>
So why was I stalling ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Best of all ,COMMA I'm healthier ,COMMA I know that I'm going to live longer ,COMMA and I've even lost a little weight .PERIOD <BREAK>
Thank you .PERIOD <BREAK>
Some of these have already been touched upon by other speakers ,COMMA which is encouraging .PERIOD <BREAK>
The first is -- death is a big problem .PERIOD <BREAK>
Sometimes ,COMMA we don't see a problem because either it's too familiar or it's too big .PERIOD <BREAK>
People like -- it's roughly the population in this room has just died .PERIOD <BREAK>
Suppose we approximated one person with one book ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
So that's the first big problem .PERIOD <BREAK>
Well ,COMMA let's first look at the probability -- and this is very ,COMMA very difficult to estimate -- but there have been only four studies on this in recent years ,COMMA which is surprising .PERIOD <BREAK>
He estimated a probability that we will fail to survive the current century :COLON 50 percent .PERIOD <BREAK>
Another author doesn't give any numerical estimate ,COMMA but says the probability is significant that it will fail .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA if we think about what just reducing the probability of human extinction by just one percentage point -- not very much -- so that's equivalent to 60 million lives saved ,COMMA if we just count the currently living people ,COMMA the current generation .PERIOD <BREAK>
The only thing you should focus on would be to reduce existential risk because even the tiniest decrease in existential risk would just overwhelm any other benefit you could hope to achieve .PERIOD <BREAK>
And even if you just look at the current people ,COMMA and ignore the potential that would be lost if we went extinct ,COMMA it should still have a high priority .PERIOD <BREAK>
We were very successful .PERIOD <BREAK>
We might end up with something like this ,COMMA which is -- I mean ,COMMA it's a heck of a lot better than that .PERIOD <BREAK>
And they also all seem a little bit -- most people have this instinct that ,COMMA well ,COMMA sure ,COMMA there needs to be anti-depressants for the really depressed people .PERIOD <BREAK>
Intellectual capacity -- let's take that box ,COMMA which falls into a lot of different sub-categories :COLON memory ,COMMA concentration ,COMMA mental energy ,COMMA intelligence ,COMMA empathy .PERIOD <BREAK>
Able to switch back and forth more easily would be a neat thing to be able to do -- easier to achieve the flow state ,COMMA when you're totally immersed in something you are doing .PERIOD <BREAK>
If you could actually choose to preserve your romantic attachments to one person ,COMMA undiminished through time ,COMMA so that wouldn't have to -- love would never have to fade if you didn't want it to .PERIOD <BREAK>
Might be more complicated in humans ,COMMA but perhaps not that much .PERIOD <BREAK>
Well ,COMMA we know already that in this little human circle there ,COMMA there are these enormously wonderful and worthwhile modes of being -- human life at its best is wonderful .PERIOD <BREAK>
We have no reason to believe that within this much ,COMMA much larger space there would not also be extremely worthwhile modes of being ,COMMA perhaps ones that would be way beyond our wildest ability even to imagine or dream about .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so ,COMMA to fix this third problem ,COMMA I think we need -- slowly ,COMMA carefully ,COMMA with ethical wisdom and constraint -- develop the means that enable us to go out in this larger space and explore it and find the great values that might hide there .PERIOD <BREAK>
The sun end was about four inches in diameter ,COMMA and then it tapered over about 35 feet to about a millimeter at the Earth end .PERIOD <BREAK>
So I got it down to just one tether to be able to support that .PERIOD <BREAK>
So many forces there .PERIOD <BREAK>
If I throw a very concentric circle ,COMMA or concentric ellipse ,COMMA it just dutifully makes these evenly spaced lines ,COMMA which get closer and closer together ,COMMA which describes how gravity works .PERIOD <BREAK>
Because since it has the ability to make forms that look like forms that we're familiar with in biology ,COMMA it's also making other forms that we're not familiar with .PERIOD <BREAK>
Oh ,COMMA let's hope so .PERIOD Oh ,COMMA my God ,COMMA let's .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I think nature wants to express itself in the sense that we are nature ,COMMA humans are of the universe .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we are expressions of the universe ,COMMA basically .PERIOD <BREAK>
As humans ,COMMA ultimately being part of the universe ,COMMA we're kind of the spokespeople or the observer part of the constituency of the universe .PERIOD <BREAK>
And to interface with it ,COMMA with a device that lets these forces that are everywhere act and show what they can do ,COMMA giving them pigment and paint just like an artist ,COMMA it's a good ally .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's become an art form ,COMMA a form of sculpture .PERIOD <BREAK>
But even more importantly ,COMMA he created a language ,COMMA a way we could communicate ,COMMA a code of dots ,COMMA dashes and arrows .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is an origami figure -- one sheet ,COMMA no cuts ,COMMA folding only ,COMMA hundreds of folds .PERIOD <BREAK>
This ,COMMA too ,COMMA is origami ,COMMA and this shows where we've gone in the modern world .PERIOD <BREAK>
You can get horns ,COMMA antlers -- even ,COMMA if you look close ,COMMA cloven hooves .PERIOD <BREAK>
And what changed is something you might not have expected in an art ,COMMA which is math .PERIOD <BREAK>
I mean ,COMMA a stag beetle -- it's got two points for jaws ,COMMA it's got antennae .PERIOD Can you be that specific in the detail ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
If I make the flaps skinnier ,COMMA I can use a bit less paper .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I can use those patterns now to create origami shapes .PERIOD <BREAK>
Do a little more complicated instrument .PERIOD <BREAK>
And he used it to design this solar array .PERIOD <BREAK>
The telescope ,COMMA going up in space ,COMMA it unfolds in two places .PERIOD <BREAK>
The design called for geosynchronous orbit 25000 miles up ,COMMA 100 -meter diameter lens .PERIOD <BREAK>
And rockets are small .PERIOD So you have to make it smaller .PERIOD <BREAK>
But this pattern's not going to work to get something 100 meters down to a few meters .PERIOD <BREAK>
And they want to do their design by simulation .PERIOD <BREAK>
And as weird and surprising as it may sound ,COMMA origami may someday even save a life .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA ecstasy in Greek meant simply to stand to the side of something .PERIOD <BREAK>
You can't understand more than two people talking to you .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it has become a kind of a truism in the study of creativity that you can't be creating anything with less than 10 years of technical-knowledge immersion in a particular field .PERIOD <BREAK>
Whether it's mathematics or music ,COMMA it takes that long to be able to begin to change something in a way that it's better than what was there before .PERIOD <BREAK>
You see that these people define success as something that helps others and at the same time makes you feel happy as you are working at it .PERIOD <BREAK>
The other combinations of challenge and skill become progressively less optimal .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that is the kind of challenge that we're trying to understand .PERIOD <BREAK>
Not a lot of women did .PERIOD <BREAK>
The ' 20 s and the ' 60 s also come to mind .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is really just about the facts of this economic moment that we live in .PERIOD <BREAK>
This second set of headlines -- you can see that families and marriages are starting to shift .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so they decided ,COMMA because they were intrigued by this finding ,COMMA to do a nationwide survey .PERIOD <BREAK>
So they spread out all the census data ,COMMA and what they found ,COMMA the guy described to me as a shocker ,COMMA which is that in 1997 out of 2000 communities ,COMMA women ,COMMA young women ,COMMA were making more money than young men .PERIOD <BREAK>
Watch what happens to the women .PERIOD Watch what happens to the men .PERIOD <BREAK>
It looks like women got some power boost on a video game ,COMMA or like they snuck in some secret serum into their birth-control pills that lets them shoot up high .PERIOD <BREAK>
What it's about is that the economy has changed a lot .PERIOD <BREAK>
So that's childcare ,COMMA elder care and food preparation .PERIOD <BREAK>
And some people say it's because ,COMMA in 9 th grade ,COMMA boys start dropping out of school .PERIOD <BREAK>
Basically ,COMMA the way they said it to me is that they would be working 18 hours a day ,COMMA that their husband would maybe have a job ,COMMA but that mostly he would be at home taking care of the kiddies .PERIOD <BREAK>
And this was kind of a shocker to me .PERIOD <BREAK>
They basically enshrined the second-class status of women in the civil code .PERIOD <BREAK>
For one thing ,COMMA it puts men and women in a really antagonistic relationship with one another ,COMMA because the men are these devious tricksters up there who've put up this glass ceiling .PERIOD <BREAK>
So the image that I like to think of ,COMMA instead of glass ceiling ,COMMA is the high bridge .PERIOD <BREAK>
There's no man or woman standing in the middle about to cut the cables .PERIOD <BREAK>
To the dismay of my mother ,COMMA this is dangerous teenage fashion right there .PERIOD <BREAK>
Really make a fully integrated product ,COMMA something beautiful .PERIOD <BREAK>
This baby is fully electric .PERIOD <BREAK>
All the projections [say that] this one [billion] will [only] grow with one to two or three percent .PERIOD <BREAK>
[But this second] grows with seven ,COMMA eight percent ,COMMA and then they will end up here .PERIOD <BREAK>
They will start flying .PERIOD <BREAK>
Because we already have this [growth] in process .PERIOD <BREAK>
The year is 1960 .PERIOD <BREAK>
Can you see ,COMMA as the years pass by ,COMMA child survival is increasing ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
It's only by child survival that we will stop population growth .PERIOD <BREAK>
In the front ,COMMA you see ,COMMA actually ,COMMA Joe Murray getting the patient ready for the transplant ,COMMA while in the back room you see Hartwell Harrison ,COMMA the Chief of Urology at Harvard ,COMMA actually harvesting the kidney .PERIOD <BREAK>
That really has to do with our aging population .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's not really that foreign of a concept ,COMMA actually ;SEMICOLON it happens on the Earth every day .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA your body is constantly regenerating .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA how can we harness that power ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
That's exactly what you see here .PERIOD <BREAK>
To the naked eye they look like a piece of your blouse ,COMMA or your shirt ,COMMA but actually these materials are fairly complex and they are designed to degrade once inside the body .PERIOD <BREAK>
It disintegrates a few months later .PERIOD <BREAK>
What about other structures ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
This is actually an engineered blood vessel .PERIOD <BREAK>
You now have your fully seeded scaffold .PERIOD <BREAK>
We then take a scaffold that we shape like a bladder .PERIOD <BREAK>
We place it back into this oven-like device .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA bladders are definitely a little bit more complex than the other structures .PERIOD <BREAK>
But there are other hollow organs that have added complexity to it .PERIOD <BREAK>
We exercise these prior to implantation .PERIOD <BREAK>
All we are left with is the skeleton ,COMMA if you will ,COMMA of the liver ,COMMA all made up of collagen ,COMMA a material that's in our bodies ,COMMA that will not reject .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is still experimental .PERIOD But we are able to actually reproduce the functionality of the liver structure ,COMMA experimentally .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA another strategy we're following is actually to create wafers that we stack together ,COMMA like an accordion ,COMMA if you will .PERIOD <BREAK>
If at all possible ,COMMA we really would like to use smart biomaterials that we can just take off the shelf and regenerate your organs .PERIOD <BREAK>
Why ?QUESTIONMARK Because we'd rather take those cells which already know that those are the cell types you want .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we prefer cells that will not reject and will not form tumors .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we're working a lot with the stem cells that we published on two years ago ,COMMA stem cells from the amniotic fluid ,COMMA and the placenta ,COMMA which have those properties .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA I always like to show this cartoon .PERIOD <BREAK>
And there you see the stagecoach driver ,COMMA and he goes ,COMMA on the top panel ,COMMA He goes A ,COMMA B ,COMMA C ,COMMA D ,COMMA E ,COMMA F .PERIOD <BREAK>
Entrepreneurs are people -- because we have a lot of them in this room -- who have these ideas and these passions or see these needs in the world and we decide to stand up and do it .PERIOD <BREAK>
And as a young kid ,COMMA nobody can say it can't happen because you're too dumb to realize that you couldn't figure it out .PERIOD <BREAK>
If we can teach our kids to become entrepreneurial -- the ones that show those traits to be -- like we teach the ones who have science gifts to go on in science ,COMMA what if we saw the ones who had entrepreneurial traits and taught them to be entrepreneurs ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
We could actually have all these kids spreading businesses instead of waiting for government handouts .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the media says that it's really cool if we could go out and be a model or a singer or a sports hero like Luongo ,COMMA Crosby .PERIOD <BREAK>
Our MBA programs do not teach kids to be entrepreneurs .PERIOD <BREAK>
We didn't fit in the normal work .PERIOD We couldn't work for somebody else because we're too stubborn and we have all these other traits .PERIOD <BREAK>
I could go on and on .PERIOD <BREAK>
Fit into this other system and try to become a student .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'm also quoted -- and I told the person who wrote the textbook -- I'm now quoted in that exact same university textbook in every Canadian university and college studies .PERIOD <BREAK>
I open up chapter eight talking about budgeting .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I told the author ,COMMA after they did my interview ,COMMA that I cheated in that same course .PERIOD <BREAK>
And my mom came into the room and she said ,COMMA Where are you going to get the coat hangers to sell to the dry cleaners ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
I'm like ,COMMA But you have two cars and they don't have license plate protectors .PERIOD <BREAK>
So I knew there were two cars with two license plates on each .PERIOD <BREAK>
But it was obvious to me ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK Buy low ,COMMA sell high .PERIOD <BREAK>
Don't try to sell to the poor kids ;SEMICOLON they don't have cash .PERIOD The rich people do .PERIOD Go get some .PERIOD <BREAK>
So that's obvious ,COMMA right .PERIOD <BREAK>
and making money off that too .PERIOD <BREAK>
I built these little pincushions when I was 11 years old in Cubs ,COMMA and we made these pin cushions for our moms for Mother's Day .PERIOD <BREAK>
And you'd make these chairs .PERIOD <BREAK>
You get the golf balls ,COMMA and you just throw them in your bathing suit trunks and when you're done you've got a couple hundred of them .PERIOD <BREAK>
And they could use those for practice balls .PERIOD <BREAK>
But it paid the bills .PERIOD <BREAK>
I remember being told to walk out in the middle of a street in Banff ,COMMA Alberta because I'd thrown a penny out in the street ,COMMA and my dad said ,COMMA Go pick it up .PERIOD <BREAK>
But then we negotiate on what they're going to get paid .PERIOD <BREAK>
You breed that kind of stuff .PERIOD Each of my kids has two piggy banks .PERIOD <BREAK>
The 50 percent that goes in their house account ,COMMA every six months ,COMMA goes to the bank .PERIOD <BREAK>
Just do that kind of stuff and have fun with it .PERIOD <BREAK>
We have all these lessons in front of us ,COMMA but we don't take those opportunities ;SEMICOLON we teach kids to go get a tutor .PERIOD <BREAK>
My kids love this stuff .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's a video that was done by one of the companies that I mentor .PERIOD <BREAK>
They were trying to figure out how to rebuild their universities .PERIOD <BREAK>
Since education under the Soviet Union was essentially propaganda serving the purposes of a state ideology ,COMMA they appreciated that it would take wholesale transformations if they were to provide an education worthy of free men and women .PERIOD <BREAK>
You may think you know what is going on in that Jane Austen novel -- that is ,COMMA until your first encounter with postmodern deconstructionism .PERIOD <BREAK>
When the astronomical distance between the realities of the academy and the visionary intensity of this challenge were more than enough ,COMMA I can assure you ,COMMA to give one pause ,COMMA what was happening outside higher education made backing off unthinkable .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that was only the beginning .PERIOD <BREAK>
Incredibly ,COMMA this nation ,COMMA with all its material ,COMMA intellectual and spiritual resources ,COMMA seems utterly helpless to reverse the freefall in any of these areas .PERIOD <BREAK>
We are playing with fire .PERIOD <BREAK>
On a more personal note ,COMMA this betrayal of our principles ,COMMA our decency ,COMMA our hope ,COMMA made it impossible for me to avoid the question ,COMMA What will I say ,COMMA years from now ,COMMA when people ask ,COMMA 'Where were you' As president of a leading liberal arts college ,COMMA famous for its innovative history ,COMMA there were no excuses .PERIOD <BREAK>
The challenge :COLON to figure out what it will take to actually do something that makes a significant and sustainable difference .PERIOD <BREAK>
Even more valuable ,COMMA history provides a laboratory in which we see played out the actual ,COMMA as well as the intended consequences of ideas .PERIOD <BREAK>
Students ,COMMA in turn ,COMMA continuously move outside the classroom to engage the world directly .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is a political education ,COMMA to be sure .PERIOD <BREAK>
The center will embody and sustain this new educational commitment .PERIOD <BREAK>
What is certain is that the individual talent exhibited in such abundance here ,COMMA needs to turn its attention to that collaborative ,COMMA messy ,COMMA frustrating ,COMMA contentious and impossible world of politics and public policy .PERIOD <BREAK>
All right .PERIOD Okay ,COMMA so .PERIOD perfect .PERIOD <BREAK>
They go to church ,COMMA by which I mean ,COMMA they do lots of things for free for each other .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA I know you don't believe me ,COMMA really ,COMMA here .PERIOD <BREAK>
He's a terrible producer of videos ,COMMA but it's great content ,COMMA so I'm going to give you a little bit of it .PERIOD <BREAK>
So here he is beginning .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is this fantastic Brat Pack remix set to Lisztomania .PERIOD <BREAK>
They decided they wanted to do the same .PERIOD <BREAK>
So that's importantly different from the earlier videos we looked at because here ,COMMA remix isn't just about an individual doing something alone in his basement ;SEMICOLON it becomes an act of social creativity .PERIOD <BREAK>
Indeed ,COMMA Mickey Mouse himself ,COMMA of course ,COMMA as Steamboat Willie ,COMMA is a remix of the then ,COMMA very dominant ,COMMA very popular Steamboat Bill by Buster Keaton .PERIOD <BREAK>
He is the celebration and ideal of exactly this kind of creativity .PERIOD <BREAK>
But then the company passes through this dark stage to this Democrat .PERIOD <BREAK>
Okay ,COMMA for a second example ,COMMA think about this cultural hero ,COMMA icon on the Left ,COMMA creator of this character .PERIOD <BREAK>
Look at the site that he built :COLON Star Wars MashUps ,COMMA inviting people to come and use their creative energy to produce a new generation of attention towards this extraordinarily important cultural icon .PERIOD <BREAK>
So the point is the Republicans here recognize that there's a certain need of ownership ,COMMA a respect for ownership ,COMMA the respect we should give the creator ,COMMA the remixer ,COMMA the owner ,COMMA the property owner ,COMMA the copyright owner of this extraordinarily powerful stuff ,COMMA and not a generation of sharecroppers .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA I think there are lessons we should learn here ,COMMA lessons about openness .PERIOD <BREAK>
Our lives are sharing activities ,COMMA at least in part .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's number one .PERIOD Number two :COLON This ecology of sharing needs freedom within which to create .PERIOD <BREAK>
And number three :COLON We need to respect the creator ,COMMA the creator of these remixes through rights that are directly tied to them .PERIOD <BREAK>
These tools that we built enable this sharing in parts through licenses that make it clear and a freedom to create without requiring permission first because the permission has already been granted and a respect for the creator because it builds upon a copyright the creator has licensed freely .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it explains the vast right-wing conspiracy that's obviously developed around these licenses ,COMMA as now more than 350 million digital objects are out there ,COMMA licensed freely in this way .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA if we can learn those values from at least some influences on the Right ,COMMA if we can take them and incorporate them ,COMMA maybe we could do a little trade .PERIOD <BREAK>
In fact ,COMMA someone on Reddit thought ,COMMA Oh ,COMMA what a great thing ,COMMA we should all vote this up .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that was that the Internet loves Mister Splashy Pants .PERIOD <BREAK>
They even created an e-card so you could send your friend a dancing Splashy .PERIOD <BREAK>
There are so many great publishing tools that are available ,COMMA it only takes a few minutes of your time now to actually produce something .PERIOD <BREAK>
If you want to succeed you've got to be okay to just lose control .PERIOD <BREAK>
Well we all know the World Wide Web has absolutely transformed publishing ,COMMA broadcasting ,COMMA commerce and social connectivity ,COMMA but where did it all come from ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Vannevar Bush was the US .PERIOD government's chief scientific adviser during the war .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the memex would link information ,COMMA one piece of information to a related piece of information and so forth .PERIOD <BREAK>
He built a system .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we delivered the world's first hypertext system .PERIOD <BREAK>
They had a 12 -page supplement in the Wall Street Journal the day it launched .PERIOD <BREAK>
I thought ,COMMA well ,COMMA you know ,COMMA interesting ,COMMA but a guy from CERN ,COMMA he's not going to do this .PERIOD <BREAK>
In 1992 ,COMMA his paper was rejected for the Hypertext Conference .PERIOD <BREAK>
Secondly ,COMMA for the first time in the modern era ,COMMA the dominant country in the world -- which I think is what China will become -- will be not from the West and from very ,COMMA very different civilizational roots .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA I know it's a widespread assumption in the West that as countries modernize ,COMMA they also westernize .PERIOD <BREAK>
It will remain in very fundamental respects very different .PERIOD <BREAK>
In other words ,COMMA China ,COMMA unlike the Western states and most countries in the world ,COMMA is shaped by its sense of civilization ,COMMA its existence as a civilization-state ,COMMA rather than as a nation-state .PERIOD <BREAK>
Well ,COMMA basically the East was swallowed by the West .PERIOD <BREAK>
Hence their attitude ,COMMA for example ,COMMA to the Uyghurs and to the Tibetans .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is the Chinese view of the state -- very ,COMMA very different to ours .PERIOD <BREAK>
Know that China believes in the market and the state .PERIOD <BREAK>
Moreover ,COMMA this is a very old state tradition ,COMMA a very old tradition of statecraft .PERIOD <BREAK>
And yet we still insist ,COMMA by and large ,COMMA in thinking that we can understand China by simply drawing on Western experience ,COMMA looking at it through Western eyes ,COMMA using Western concepts .PERIOD <BREAK>
But it's not .PERIOD <BREAK>
Whereas those cultures -- virtually the rest of the world ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA which have been in a far weaker position ,COMMA vis-a-vis the West -- have been thereby forced to understand the West ,COMMA because of the West's presence in those societies .PERIOD <BREAK>
Because what's happening ?QUESTIONMARK Back to that chart at the beginning ,COMMA the Goldman Sachs chart .PERIOD <BREAK>
Europe was not at the final negotiating table .PERIOD <BREAK>
Well ,COMMA maybe that's true ,COMMA maybe that's an exaggeration .PERIOD <BREAK>
But there's another problem which goes along with this -- that Europe is increasingly out of touch with the world -- and that is a sort of loss of a sense of the future .PERIOD <BREAK>
Or take this :COLON now this is an idea ,COMMA but it's an idea to be tried out shortly in a suburb of Beijing .PERIOD <BREAK>
Accelerometers on each hand read hand position .PERIOD <BREAK>
And he was very impressed .PERIOD He was all tearing up .PERIOD Ready to hug me .PERIOD <BREAK>
I must have done about 30000 caricatures .PERIOD <BREAK>
That evening ,COMMA I came home to hundreds of hate mails ,COMMA hundreds of people telling me how they could have lived another day without seeing this .PERIOD <BREAK>
I was also asked to leave the organization ,COMMA a cartoonists' organization in America ,COMMA that for me was my lifeline .PERIOD <BREAK>
And ,COMMA all of a sudden ,COMMA my paintings came alive .PERIOD <BREAK>
The collaborative effort was fabulous .PERIOD <BREAK>
Since I mentioned my wife ,COMMA the most important collaboration has been with her ,COMMA Netra .PERIOD <BREAK>
I must have been 19 and a half then ,COMMA and it was love at first sight .PERIOD <BREAK>
I lived in India .PERIOD She lived in America .PERIOD <BREAK>
Notice one thing ,COMMA we're equal here .PERIOD <BREAK>
We had fashion designers ,COMMA installation artists ,COMMA models ,COMMA we had makeup artists ,COMMA jewelry designers ,COMMA all kinds of people working with me to make my wedding an art installation .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I had a special installation in tribute to my in-laws .PERIOD <BREAK>
I could not live this larger than life person .PERIOD <BREAK>
This time I said let's try something different .PERIOD <BREAK>
And this was just eight months ago .PERIOD <BREAK>
I walk into her room ,COMMA and there was a shy girl ,COMMA and she was bald ,COMMA and she was trying to hide her baldness .PERIOD <BREAK>
I whipped out my pen ,COMMA and I started drawing on her head and I drew a crown for her .PERIOD <BREAK>
Our computers ,COMMA our systems will be as primitive as the Apollo's are for today .PERIOD <BREAK>
We can develop any part of the body .PERIOD <BREAK>
The other major development is going to be in the area of what can happen in genetics .PERIOD <BREAK>
This would imply a massive leap in migration .PERIOD <BREAK>
An individual ,COMMA for the first time in the history of humanity ,COMMA will have the capacity ,COMMA by 2030 ,COMMA to destroy the planet ,COMMA to wreck everything ,COMMA through the creation ,COMMA for example ,COMMA of a biopathogen .PERIOD <BREAK>
More people ,COMMA smaller spaces ,COMMA less stuff .PERIOD <BREAK>
For example ,COMMA I want to use Zipcar .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so from a branding perspective ,COMMA they got a lot right .PERIOD <BREAK>
Platforms are invitations .PERIOD <BREAK>
So creating Craigslist or iTunes and the iPhone developer network ,COMMA there are all these networks -- Facebook as well .PERIOD <BREAK>
Essentially ,COMMA there are all sorts of restaurants in Oakland ,COMMA near where I live .PERIOD <BREAK>
And one quick example is Velib ,COMMA in 2007 ,COMMA came forward in Paris with a very bold proposition ,COMMA a very big bike-sharing service .PERIOD <BREAK>
We're at the very beginning of something that ,COMMA what we're seeing and the way that mesh companies are coming forward ,COMMA is inviting ,COMMA it's engaging ,COMMA but it's very early .PERIOD <BREAK>
You have to make a wish to save the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
I mean ,COMMA I can't save the world .PERIOD Nobody can .PERIOD <BREAK>
I know those guys .PERIOD <BREAK>
It was the only one I had at that time .PERIOD <BREAK>
They were making scary faces to play the caricature of themselves .PERIOD <BREAK>
So we decided to take portraits of Palestinians and Israelis doing the same jobs -- taxi-driver ,COMMA lawyer ,COMMA cooks .PERIOD <BREAK>
The experts said ,COMMA No way .PERIOD <BREAK>
We said ,COMMA Okay ,COMMA let's try and push as far as we can .PERIOD <BREAK>
Okay ,COMMA for example ,COMMA that's Palestine .PERIOD <BREAK>
Three kids -- that was three students -- were [detained] by the army because they were not carrying their papers .PERIOD <BREAK>
We need culture out there .PERIOD <BREAK>
You see that enough in the media .PERIOD <BREAK>
What I want to show is the incredible life .PERIOD <BREAK>
During that time ,COMMA you haven't thought about what you're going to eat tomorrow .PERIOD <BREAK>
When you look at Kibera now ,COMMA they look back .PERIOD <BREAK>
So we could just walk in the street during the next days and the photos would get revealed by themselves .PERIOD <BREAK>
So we didn't get caught this time .PERIOD <BREAK>
Hopefully ,COMMA you'll see the film ,COMMA and you'll understand the scope of the project and what the people felt when they saw those photos .PERIOD <BREAK>
Because that's a big part of it .PERIOD There's layers behind each photo .PERIOD <BREAK>
But tell me ,COMMA advertising for what ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
The people I photograph were proud to participate in the project and to have their photo in the community .PERIOD <BREAK>
The importance is what you do with the images ,COMMA the statement it makes where it's pasted .PERIOD <BREAK>
This image of three men wearing gas masks was taken in Chernobyl originally ,COMMA and I pasted it in Southern Italy ,COMMA where the mafia sometimes bury the garbage under the ground .PERIOD <BREAK>
So a subject you're passionate about ,COMMA a person who you want to tell their story or even your own photos -- tell me what you stand for .PERIOD <BREAK>
Einstein's especially interested in Penelope's talk .PERIOD <BREAK>
A lot of her research goes on in caves ,COMMA which can get pretty dusty .PERIOD <BREAK>
Well ,COMMA that's really cool ,COMMA but what Einstein's really hoping is that maybe he'll genetically engineer a five-pound peanut .PERIOD <BREAK>
That is one big peanut .PERIOD Since Einstein is a bird ,COMMA she's very interested in things that fly .PERIOD <BREAK>
E :COLON [Spaceship noise] SW :COLON Even if it doesn't have a laser ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
E :COLON [Squawks] SW :COLON Yeah ,COMMA it sure can .PERIOD But when Einstein needs to relax from her job educating the public ,COMMA she loves to take in the arts .PERIOD <BREAK>
Or maybe Sirena Huang would like to learn some arias on her violin ,COMMA and Einstein can sing along with some opera ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
E :COLON [Operatic squawk] SW :COLON Very good .PERIOD <BREAK>
Or maybe Stu just needs another backup singer ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
You like to drink water .PERIOD <BREAK>
Again .PERIOD <BREAK>
E :COLON Ooooowww .PERIOD <BREAK>
E :COLON Goodbye .PERIOD <BREAK>
And about five years ago ,COMMA we asked what was the most important need for innovation in schooling here in the UK .PERIOD <BREAK>
The minister of education down south in London described himself as a big fan .PERIOD <BREAK>
They're not like all of you who can sit in rows and hear things said to you for hour after hour .PERIOD <BREAK>
I would run into the living room ,COMMA jump up on the couch ,COMMA rip the cushions off ,COMMA throw them on the floor ,COMMA scream at the top of my lungs and run out because I was the Incredible Hulk .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I would like to share my art .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA moving onward .PERIOD <BREAK>
First principles ,COMMA this is very important .PERIOD <BREAK>
I tried kickboards .PERIOD <BREAK>
Hand paddles ,COMMA everything .PERIOD <BREAK>
Kicking harder doesn't solve the problem because the average swimmer only transfers about three percent of their energy expenditure into forward motion .PERIOD <BREAK>
So let's look at some examples .PERIOD This is Terry .PERIOD <BREAK>
Rather ,COMMA he is entering the water at a 45 -degree angle with his forearm ,COMMA and then propelling himself by streamlining -- very important .PERIOD <BREAK>
Below is what most swimmers will find enables them to do what I did ,COMMA which is going from 21 strokes per 20 -yard length to 11 strokes in two workouts with no coach ,COMMA no video monitoring .PERIOD <BREAK>
In freestyle ,COMMA easiest way to remedy this is to turn with body roll ,COMMA and just to look at your recovery hand as it enters the water .PERIOD <BREAK>
Then I transferred to a different school sophomore year ,COMMA and I had a choice of other languages .PERIOD Most of my friends were taking Japanese .PERIOD <BREAK>
I couldn't believe I was on the other side of the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
And a teacher came up to me and handed me a piece of paper .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that's pretty much my response .PERIOD <BREAK>
Nothing worked until I found this .PERIOD <BREAK>
Many of the publications in Japan limit themselves to these characters ,COMMA to facilitate literacy -- some are required to .PERIOD <BREAK>
And now I love languages .PERIOD <BREAK>
I was so concerned with her perception of what I was doing ,COMMA that it exploded in my face ,COMMA never to return to the ballroom dancing club .PERIOD <BREAK>
Everyone burst into laughter .PERIOD I was humiliated .PERIOD <BREAK>
So I had a very short deadline for a competition .PERIOD <BREAK>
These seemed to be the three areas that I could exploit to compete if I wanted to comptete against people who'd been practicing for 20 to 30 years .PERIOD <BREAK>
That photo is of the semi-finals of the Buenos Aires championships ,COMMA four months later .PERIOD <BREAK>
Then one month later ,COMMA went to the world championships ,COMMA made it to the semi-final .PERIOD And then set a world record ,COMMA following that ,COMMA two weeks later .PERIOD <BREAK>
So he can lift the woman to break her ,COMMA for example .PERIOD <BREAK>
There are many different types .PERIOD <BREAK>
I have hundreds of hours of footage -- all categorized ,COMMA much like George Carlin categorized his comedy .PERIOD <BREAK>
So fear is your friend .PERIOD Fear is an indicator .PERIOD <BREAK>
Especially with fears you gained when you were a child .PERIOD <BREAK>
And if any of you are interested in that ,COMMA I would love to speak with you .PERIOD <BREAK>
But I ask a lot of questions ,COMMA and I would love your advice .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's written using Wiki software -- which is the type of software he just demonstrated -- so anyone can quickly edit and save ,COMMA and it goes live on the Internet immediately .PERIOD <BREAK>
So when Yochai is talking about new methods of organization ,COMMA he's exactly describing Wikipedia .PERIOD And what I'm going to do today is tell you a little bit more about how it really works on the inside .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so if you think about what that means ,COMMA it means a lot more than just building a cool website .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so that's a big part of why we've chosen the free licensing model ,COMMA because that empowers local entrepreneurs -- or anyone who wants to ,COMMA can take our content and do anything they like with it -- you can copy it ,COMMA redistribute it and you can do it commercially or non-commercially .PERIOD <BREAK>
The biggest languages are German ,COMMA Japanese ,COMMA French -- all the Western European languages are quite big .PERIOD <BREAK>
So the big question when you've got this really chaotic organization is ,COMMA why isn't it all rubbish ?QUESTIONMARK Why is the website as good as it is ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
The actual truth about the specific Bush-Kerry incident is that the Bush-Kerry articles were locked less than one percent of the time in 2004 ,COMMA and it wasn't because they were contentious ;SEMICOLON it was just because there was routine vandalism -- which happens sometimes even on stage ,COMMA people -- sometimes even reporters have reported to me that they vandalize Wikipedia and were amazed that it was fixed so quickly .PERIOD <BREAK>
So the biggest and the most important thing is our neutral point-of-view policy .PERIOD <BREAK>
If you engage in that type of behavior ,COMMA you'll be asked to leave the community .PERIOD <BREAK>
And then users can set up their own personal watch list .PERIOD <BREAK>
So my page is on quite a few volunteers' watch lists ,COMMA because it is sometimes vandalized .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that's a really important thing to understand ,COMMA is that the vast majority of the edits that go on on the website are from a very close-knit community of maybe 600 to 1000 people who are in constant communication .PERIOD <BREAK>
Another thing that we do within the community is we leave everything very open-ended .PERIOD <BREAK>
I give this talk sometimes with Angela ,COMMA who was just re-elected to the Board from the community -- to the Board of the Foundation ,COMMA with more than twice the votes of the person who didn't make it .PERIOD <BREAK>
Of course ,COMMA the vote ended up being about 85 to 18 ,COMMA so there was no real danger to our democratic processes .PERIOD <BREAK>
It strikes me that much of the textbooks that are used to educate our children are inherently biased .PERIOD <BREAK>
Have you found Wikipedia being used by teachers ,COMMA and how do you see Wikipedia changing education ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
It builds on the storyline of bloggers versus newspapers .PERIOD <BREAK>
I sent it from my Harvard email address ,COMMA because I was recently appointed a fellow there .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so the Wiki books project is an effort to do that .PERIOD <BREAK>
In the jungles of Guatemala ,COMMA in Tikal ,COMMA stands a temple .PERIOD <BREAK>
His name was Jasaw Chan K'awiil .PERIOD <BREAK>
He lived into his 80 s ,COMMA and he was buried beneath this monument in 720 AD .PERIOD <BREAK>
They've never found a society that did not have it .PERIOD <BREAK>
It was told by an anonymous Kwakiutl Indian of southern Alaska to a missionary in 1896 ,COMMA and here it is .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's below your emotions .PERIOD <BREAK>
It comes from a David Mamet play ,COMMA and there's two con artists in the play ,COMMA and the woman is conning the man ,COMMA and the man looks at the woman and says ,COMMA Oh ,COMMA you're a bad pony ,COMMA I'm not going to bet on you .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA what have I learned from this experiment that I would like to tell the world ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Too old ,COMMA too young ,COMMA too scruffy ,COMMA too stupid ,COMMA and they won't do it .PERIOD <BREAK>
And in fact ,COMMA sometimes I feel a little sorry for the chicken on my dinner plate ,COMMA when I think of how intense this brain system is .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so ,COMMA I've spent the last three years on this .PERIOD <BREAK>

But that can't be what made the difference .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that rarely ,COMMA if ever ,COMMA caused anything like the Scientific Revolution .PERIOD <BREAK>
At the time ,COMMA what they thought distinguished science was a radical idea about things unseen ,COMMA known as empiricism .PERIOD <BREAK>
In what language ?QUESTIONMARK Certainly not the language of mathematics ,COMMA in which ,COMMA Galileo rightly said ,COMMA the book of nature is written .PERIOD <BREAK>
By the way ,COMMA why don't we do that ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
We don't see those nuclear reactions in stars .PERIOD <BREAK>

But unfortunately ,COMMA 95 percent of the glaciers in the Arctic are also receding right now to the point that the ice is ending up on land and not injecting any ice back into the ecosystem .PERIOD <BREAK>

Developmental psychology has shown that kids come into the world already knowing so much about the physical and social worlds ,COMMA and programmed to make it really easy for them to learn certain things and hard to learn others .PERIOD <BREAK>
Here are the results .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA as you see ,COMMA people care about harm and care issues .PERIOD <BREAK>
You picked a particular breed ,COMMA you learned some new information about the breed .PERIOD <BREAK>
In the first panel ,COMMA we see the moment of creation .PERIOD <BREAK>
It shoots up and it keeps going up .PERIOD <BREAK>
I think that's probably right ,COMMA although this is a controversial issue .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's just a lot of rock ,COMMA and then a lot of water and wind ,COMMA and a lot of time ,COMMA and you get the Grand Canyon .PERIOD <BREAK>
So liberals speak for the weak and oppressed .PERIOD <BREAK>

But as we learned from Samantha Power ,COMMA in her story about Sergio Vieira de Mello ,COMMA you can't just go charging in ,COMMA saying ,COMMA You're wrong ,COMMA and I'm right .PERIOD <BREAK>
If Australia had to send a thousand people tomorrow to West Papua for example ,COMMA we don't have a thousand police officers hanging around that could just go tomorrow and we do have a thousand soldiers that could go .PERIOD <BREAK>
So when we have to send someone ,COMMA we send the military -- because they're there ,COMMA they're available and ,COMMA heck ,COMMA they're used to going off and doing these things and living by themselves and not having all this extra support .PERIOD <BREAK>
One particular thing that's come up that I am especially interested in is the question of whether ,COMMA when we're sending military personnel to do these sorts of jobs ,COMMA we ought to be equipping them differently ,COMMA and in particular ,COMMA whether we ought to be giving them access to some of the sorts of non-lethal weapons that police have .PERIOD <BREAK>
Military personnel are being trained for war ,COMMA so they're trained that ,COMMA as soon as things go bad ,COMMA their first response is lethal force .PERIOD <BREAK>
And of course ,COMMA being Australian ,COMMA I started looking at stuff in Australia ,COMMA knowing ,COMMA again ,COMMA from my own experience about various times when non-lethal weapons have been introduced in Australia .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is something they can use instead of a firearm in those situations where they would have previously had to shoot someone .PERIOD <BREAK>
This was something explicitly introduced to be an alternative to firearms ,COMMA but it's being routinely used to deal with a whole range of other sorts of problems .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now one of the particular issues that comes up with military use of non-lethal weapons -- and people when they're actually saying ,COMMA Well hey ,COMMA there might be some problems -- there's a couple of particular problems that get focused on .PERIOD <BREAK>
You have to be careful about who you're shooting at .PERIOD <BREAK>
They were holding something like 700 people hostage .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it's no surprise that people died ,COMMA because you don't know how much of this gas each person is going to inhale ,COMMA what position they're going to fall in when they become unconscious and so on .PERIOD <BREAK>
The person who's spraying the OC .PERIOD spray is wearing a rubber glove to make sure they don't get contaminated and so on .PERIOD <BREAK>
Just in case you think it's only going to happen in the United States ,COMMA it happened in Canada as well .PERIOD <BREAK>
And a colleague of mine sent me this one from London .PERIOD <BREAK>
I looked at it .PERIOD I was really surprised .PERIOD <BREAK>
So if you have these problems with police officers with non-lethal weapons ,COMMA what on earth would make you think it's going to be better with military personnel ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
What would these guys have done if they'd had access to Tasers or to a manned ,COMMA portable version of the Active Denial System -- a small heat ray that you can use on people and not worry about it .PERIOD <BREAK>
And here he'll explain a little bit about what it does .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I found this old video .PERIOD <BREAK>
With our strengths and our minds and spirit ,COMMA we gather ,COMMA we form ,COMMA and we fashion .PERIOD <BREAK>
This particular reel -- it's an industrial video -- but it was shown in drive-in theaters in 1961 -- in the Detroit area ,COMMA in fact -- and it preceded Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho .PERIOD <BREAK>
And when I sat down next to him ,COMMA he was telling me about a company he formed ,COMMA and he was building some robots for automobile factories to move things around on the factory floor .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now the other thing that I think is taking off ,COMMA another reason making is taking off today ,COMMA is there's some great new tools out there .PERIOD <BREAK>
So they're the brains of maker projects ,COMMA and here's an example of one .PERIOD <BREAK>
These guys came up with a kit version for 750 dollars ,COMMA and that means that hobbyists and ordinary folks can get a hold of this and begin playing with 3 D printers .PERIOD <BREAK>
Isn't that cool ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Well he did a little bit better than free .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA we all think we know what glamour is .PERIOD Here it is .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's glamorous movie stars ,COMMA like Marlene Dietrich .PERIOD <BREAK>
Fantastic ,COMMA glamorous pictures of steel mills and paper mills and all kinds of glamorous industrial places .PERIOD <BREAK>
You had a glamour .PERIOD <BREAK>
There is a process of idealization ,COMMA glorification and dramatization ,COMMA and it's not just the case for people .PERIOD <BREAK>
Glamour doesn't have to be people .PERIOD <BREAK>
It puts you into this special ,COMMA special world .PERIOD <BREAK>
She's not looking away from you exactly ,COMMA but you have to mentally imagine her world .PERIOD <BREAK>
She's encouraging you to contemplate this higher world to which she belongs ,COMMA where she can be completely tranquil while holding the iron instruments of her death by torture .PERIOD <BREAK>
This sort of streamlining styling is not just glamorous because we associate it with movies of that period ,COMMA but because ,COMMA in it's streamlining ,COMMA it transports us from the everyday .PERIOD <BREAK>
To conceal all art and make whatever is done or said appear to be without effort :COLON And this is one of the critical aspects of glamour .PERIOD <BREAK>
But if you look in a catalog -- particularly a catalog of modern ,COMMA beautiful objects for your home -- it looks like this .PERIOD <BREAK>
Part of the thing is that ,COMMA in Rear Window ,COMMA the question is ,COMMA is she too glamorous to live in his world ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And the answer is no ,COMMA but of course it's really just a movie .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA this session's supposed to be about pure pleasure but glamour's really partly about meaning .PERIOD <BREAK>
The perfect love life -- symbolized by the perfect necklace ,COMMA the perfect diamond ring .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is an interior design firm that is literally called Utopia .PERIOD <BREAK>
But there's a kind of wonder in the stuff that gets edited away in the cords of life .PERIOD <BREAK>
David Hockney talks about how the appreciation of this very glamorous painting is heightened if you think about the fact that it takes two weeks to paint this splash ,COMMA which only took a fraction of a second to happen .PERIOD <BREAK>
But I also knew how hard they worked all week .PERIOD <BREAK>
But as a scientist ,COMMA I'm interested in a different problem of other minds ,COMMA and that is the one I'm going to introduce to you today .PERIOD <BREAK>
And then finally ,COMMA to show that some of the differences between people ,COMMA in how we judge others ,COMMA can be explained by differences in this brain system .PERIOD <BREAK>
Child :COLON What ?QUESTIONMARK RS :COLON Pirates really like cheese sandwiches .PERIOD <BREAK>
This pirate is called Joshua .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now I'm going to show you a three-year-old who got the same puzzle .PERIOD <BREAK>
So the three-year-old does two things differently .PERIOD <BREAK>
And second ,COMMA when he sees Ivan taking the sandwich where he left his ,COMMA where we would say he's taking that one because he thinks it's his ,COMMA the three-year-old comes up with another explanation :COLON He's not taking his own sandwich because he doesn't want it ,COMMA because now it's dirty ,COMMA on the ground .PERIOD <BREAK>
So that's why he's taking the other sandwich .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we can see the continuation of this process of learning to think about other people's thoughts by upping the ante and asking children now ,COMMA not for an action prediction ,COMMA but for a moral judgment .PERIOD <BREAK>
Remember the five-year-old completely understood why Ivan took Joshua's sandwich .PERIOD <BREAK>
Was Ivan being mean and naughty for taking Joshua's sandwich ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
He says the wind should get in trouble for switching the sandwiches .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so what we wanted to know was ,COMMA could differences among adults in how they think about other people's thoughts be explained in terms of differences in this brain region ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And her friend drinks the coffee ,COMMA and is fine .PERIOD <BREAK>
And what you can see is ,COMMA on the left when there was very little activity in this brain region ,COMMA people paid little attention to her innocent belief and said she deserved a lot of blame for the accident .PERIOD <BREAK>
First ,COMMA I'm going to show you that this is a magnetic pulse .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'm going to show you what happens when you put a quarter on the machine .PERIOD <BREAK>
But in the case of a failed attempt to harm ,COMMA where Grace thought that it was poison ,COMMA although it was really sugar ,COMMA people now say it was more okay ,COMMA she deserves less blame for putting the powder in the coffee .PERIOD <BREAK>
So it's not a surreptitious technology .PERIOD <BREAK>
So I've got one last question .PERIOD There is this thing called the hard problem of consciousness ,COMMA that puzzles a lot of people .PERIOD <BREAK>
Why ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Me was composed of stories ,COMMA of cravings ,COMMA of strivings ,COMMA of desires of the future .PERIOD <BREAK>
Me only existed in the trying .PERIOD <BREAK>
Babies actually don't come out of your mouth .PERIOD <BREAK>
I would drive it and demand things from it .PERIOD <BREAK>
I didn't heed it ;SEMICOLON no ,COMMA I organized it and I directed it .PERIOD <BREAK>
I took more than my body had to offer .PERIOD <BREAK>
Cancer exploded the wall of my disconnection .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now I am swimming in it .PERIOD <BREAK>
So we brought her home ,COMMA and I prayed that the oil wouldn't wash up on her beach before she died .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I said ,COMMA But what's the water part ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
It was my whole self melting into Michaela's lap .PERIOD <BREAK>
It was finding my place and the huge responsibility that comes with connection .PERIOD <BREAK>
It was energy ,COMMA love and joy .PERIOD <BREAK>
It was all these things .PERIOD <BREAK>
Because everyone these days wants to know how to slow down ,COMMA but they want to know how to slow down really quickly .PERIOD So .PERIOD <BREAK>
So I was in New York recently ,COMMA and I walked past a gym that had an advertisement in the window for a new course ,COMMA a new evening course .PERIOD <BREAK>
You know ,COMMA a burnout ,COMMA or eventually the body says ,COMMA I can't take it anymore ,COMMA and throws in the towel .PERIOD <BREAK>
Am I really in such a hurry that I'm prepared to fob off my son with a sound byte at the end of the day ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
I just thought ,COMMA and I thought long and hard .PERIOD <BREAK>
And by the time I got off that plane ,COMMA I'd decided I wanted to do something about it .PERIOD <BREAK>
Time is scarce ,COMMA so what do we do ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And I guess that the question is ,COMMA is it possible to break free from that mindset ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And ,COMMA in this kind of cauldron of moments and places and acts of deceleration ,COMMA lie what a lot of people now refer to as the International Slow Movement .PERIOD <BREAK>
You know ,COMMA you tap into that -- those deeper ,COMMA sort of ,COMMA psychological ,COMMA emotional ,COMMA spiritual currents ,COMMA and you get a better orgasm with the buildup .PERIOD <BREAK>
I mean ,COMMA you heard that I got a speeding ticket while I was researching my book on the benefits of slowness ,COMMA and that's true ,COMMA but that's not all of it .PERIOD <BREAK>
I think there's a kind of metaphysical dimension -- that speed becomes a way of walling ourselves off from the bigger ,COMMA deeper questions .PERIOD <BREAK>
We fill our head with distraction ,COMMA with busyness ,COMMA so that we don't have to ask ,COMMA am I well ?QUESTIONMARK Am I happy ?QUESTIONMARK Are my children growing up right ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
It's become my reward at the end of the day ,COMMA something I really cherish .PERIOD <BREAK>
I was downstairs by the front door ,COMMA and I was waiting for a taxi ,COMMA and my son came down the stairs and he'd made a card for me .PERIOD And he was carrying it .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA what I'd like to talk about is something that was very dear to Kahn's heart ,COMMA which is :COLON how do we discover what is really particular about a project ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
This used to be an island -- Ackerman Island -- and we filled in the channel during the Depression to create jobs .PERIOD <BREAK>
And here's the building as it opened ,COMMA with a channel overlooking downtown ,COMMA and as seen from downtown .PERIOD <BREAK>
Every piece of the building works .PERIOD <BREAK>
I was very moved by what I saw today .PERIOD <BREAK>
Let's get back to the town and walk to the site .PERIOD <BREAK>
And ,COMMA as things are a little easier in India ,COMMA the site was purchased within a week and we were working .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the structures rise from the sand cliffs -- they're built in concrete and sandstones ;SEMICOLON the roofs are stainless steel -- they are facing south and reflecting light towards the temple itself ,COMMA pedestrians crisscross from one side to the other .PERIOD <BREAK>
Back to Yad Vashem three years ago .PERIOD After all this episode began ,COMMA Yad Vashem decided to rebuild completely the historic museum because now Washington was built -- the Holocaust Museum in Washington -- and that museum is so much more comprehensive in terms of information .PERIOD <BREAK>
They said ,COMMA Let's rebuild the museum .PERIOD <BREAK>
And here studying ,COMMA in three dimensions ,COMMA how to give some kind ,COMMA again ,COMMA of order ,COMMA a structure ;SEMICOLON not something you feel you could just change because you stop the design of that particular process .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'd like to conclude by relating all of what I've said to the term beauty .PERIOD <BREAK>
We call a natural object beautiful because we see that its form expresses fitness ,COMMA the perfect fulfillment of function .PERIOD <BREAK>
Nevertheless ,COMMA beauty as the kind of fit ;SEMICOLON something that tells us that all the forces that have to do with our natural environment have been fulfilled -- and our human environment -- for that .PERIOD <BREAK>
He who seeks truth shall find beauty .PERIOD He who seeks beauty shall find vanity .PERIOD <BREAK>
He who considers himself the servant of his fellow beings shall find the joy of self-expression .PERIOD He who seeks self-expression shall fall into the pit of arrogance .PERIOD <BREAK>
My name is Kailash .PERIOD And I like to enrich lives through technicolored glass .PERIOD <BREAK>
A rising tide lifts all boats .PERIOD <BREAK>
It felt like it was really important .PERIOD <BREAK>
I just really wanted to acknowledge you .PERIOD <BREAK>
It is really a sacred space .PERIOD <BREAK>
See ,COMMA these all lie right inside of this general emotional palette that we were painting .PERIOD <BREAK>
The only way that I would say it was a mistake is in that we didn't react to it .PERIOD <BREAK>
It was an opportunity that was missed .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA it's just a season .PERIOD And there are two seasons in most of South Asia .PERIOD <BREAK>
High pressure builds over India .PERIOD <BREAK>
A few kilometers ,COMMA maybe ,COMMA is quite typical .PERIOD <BREAK>
And this is called the Globe Skimmer ,COMMA or Wandering Glider .PERIOD <BREAK>
But it really hasn't been studied very much .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's a rather mediocre looking dragonfly .PERIOD <BREAK>
If you're going to study dragonflies ,COMMA you want to study those really bright beautiful ones ,COMMA like that red one .PERIOD Or the really rare ones ,COMMA the endemic endangered ones .PERIOD <BREAK>
And they were there for some time .PERIOD And then they were gone .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I didn't think anything more of it until the following year ,COMMA when it happened again ,COMMA and then the year after that ,COMMA and then the year after that .PERIOD <BREAK>
And on top of the coral reefs are sand banks .PERIOD <BREAK>
Those of you who are Indian or spent your childhood here ,COMMA let me have a show of hands ,COMMA who of you -- not yet ,COMMA not yet !EXCLAMATIONMARK <BREAK>
So ,COMMA are these things ,COMMA how are these things getting here ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
It stretches about 500 miles ,COMMA of course it's India here .PERIOD <BREAK>
When do you see the dragonflies appear ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And then the southernmost Maldives .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA I started a very rigorous scientific process .PERIOD <BREAK>
It doesn't make sense .PERIOD There is nothing for them in Maldives .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we're starting in June .PERIOD So this is the monsoon rain .PERIOD <BREAK>
Nothing for these dragonflies .PERIOD There is no more seasonal rain .PERIOD <BREAK>
They're looking for somewhere to breed .PERIOD If it rains here they'll breed .PERIOD <BREAK>
They'll hatch out in six weeks .PERIOD By that time the seasonal rains have moved on .PERIOD It's not there ,COMMA it's down here .PERIOD <BREAK>
They'll fly down here .PERIOD And the clever thing is the wind is always converging to where the rain is .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA the little fellow that hatches out here ,COMMA he gets up into the air ,COMMA he is automatically carried to where the rain is falling .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA in four generations ,COMMA one ,COMMA two ,COMMA three ,COMMA four and then back .PERIOD <BREAK>
A complete circuit of the Indian Ocean .PERIOD <BREAK>
There is more to the story .PERIOD <BREAK>
Which is an area along the Amur River ,COMMA which is up here .PERIOD <BREAK>
He's an engineer .PERIOD <BREAK>
Half as much money was spent on this Norden bombsight as was spent on the most famous military-industrial project of the modern era .PERIOD <BREAK>
It allowed you to bomb only those things that you absolutely needed and wanted to bomb .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it's carried in a box with a canvas shroud over it .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's never allowed to be photographed .PERIOD <BREAK>
There are clouds ,COMMA right .PERIOD <BREAK>
The Leuna chemical plant ,COMMA after one of the most extensive bombings in the history of the war ,COMMA was up and running within weeks .PERIOD <BREAK>
So I would like to invite you ,COMMA also ,COMMA for a while ,COMMA to the Himalayas themselves .PERIOD <BREAK>
And to show the place where meditators ,COMMA like me ,COMMA who began with being a molecular biologist in Pasteur Institute ,COMMA and found their way to the mountains .PERIOD <BREAK>
I just wrote an essay on happiness ,COMMA and there was a controversy .PERIOD <BREAK>
As Pascal said ,COMMA even the one who hangs himself ,COMMA somehow ,COMMA is looking for cessation of suffering -- he finds no other way .PERIOD <BREAK>
Although we want to avoid suffering ,COMMA it seems we are running somewhat towards it .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that can also come from some kind of confusions .PERIOD <BREAK>
It is something that -- changes of nature .PERIOD <BREAK>
It is a deep sense of serenity and fulfillment ,COMMA a state that actually pervades and underlies all emotional states ,COMMA and all the joys and sorrows that can come one's way .PERIOD <BREAK>
Can we have this kind of well-being while being sad ?QUESTIONMARK In a way ,COMMA why not ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
But there's also wicked joy ,COMMA you can rejoice in someone's suffering .PERIOD <BREAK>
We know ,COMMA by experience ,COMMA that we can be what we call a little paradise ,COMMA and yet ,COMMA be completely unhappy within .PERIOD <BREAK>
The experience that translates everything is within the mind .PERIOD <BREAK>
We have to know from ourselves ,COMMA there are certain states of mind that are conducive to this flourishing ,COMMA to this well-being ,COMMA what the Greeks called eudaimonia ,COMMA flourishing .PERIOD <BREAK>
Just the mere fact of doing that fills such a sense of adequation with our deep nature .PERIOD <BREAK>
For that we have to ask ,COMMA what is nature of mind ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And if we look from the experiential point of view ,COMMA there is a primary quality of consciousness that's just the mere fact to be cognitive ,COMMA to be aware .PERIOD <BREAK>
Usually ,COMMA when we feel annoyed ,COMMA hatred or upset with someone ,COMMA or obsessed with something ,COMMA the mind goes again and again to that object .PERIOD <BREAK>
But we think we could sit on the cloud -- but if you go there ,COMMA it's just mist .PERIOD <BREAK>
Mind transformation -- that is the very meaning of meditation .PERIOD <BREAK>
So that's what those great meditators have been doing .PERIOD <BREAK>
If you are happy about something ,COMMA you'll go more to the left side .PERIOD <BREAK>
Here ,COMMA the - 05 is the full standard deviation of a meditator who meditated on compassion .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA I've no time to go into all the different scientific results .PERIOD <BREAK>
Some meditators ,COMMA without trying to stop it ,COMMA but simply by being completely open ,COMMA thinking that that bang is just going to be just a small event like a shooting star ,COMMA they are able not to move at all .PERIOD <BREAK>
So the whole point of that is not ,COMMA sort of ,COMMA to make ,COMMA like ,COMMA a circus thing of showing exceptional beings who can jump ,COMMA or whatever .PERIOD <BREAK>
We are ready to spend 15 years achieving education .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'm not going to show you a presentation .PERIOD I'm going to talk to you .PERIOD <BREAK>
The thing that was always striking to me was that we as people could have so many really amazing ideas about things we'd like to do ,COMMA but are so often unable ,COMMA in the real world ,COMMA to actually do those things -- to actually cobble together the materials and go through the actual execution phase of building something that you imagine from a design perspective .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's going to be different than here .PERIOD <BREAK>
To give you an idea of scale ,COMMA Second Life is about 20000 CPUs at this point .PERIOD <BREAK>
And let me justify that with two statements .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I think that's something that people have talked about for 20 years -- you know ,COMMA that 3 D ,COMMA that lifelike environments are really important in some magical way to us .PERIOD <BREAK>
Second Life originally had 16 simulators .PERIOD It now has 20000 .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we had -- we zoned it ,COMMA you know :COLON we put a nightclub ,COMMA we put a disco where you could dance ,COMMA and then we had a place where you could fight with guns if you wanted to ,COMMA and we had another place that was like a boardwalk ,COMMA kind of a Coney Island .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so the existence of an economy is critical .PERIOD <BREAK>
The question is ,COMMA there appears to be a lack of cultural fine-tuning in Second Life .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so ,COMMA the multicultural nature and the sort of cultural melting pot that's happening inside Second Life is quite -- I think ,COMMA quite remarkable relative to what in real human terms in the real world we've ever been able to achieve .PERIOD <BREAK>
Other questions ?QUESTIONMARK Right here .PERIOD <BREAK>
What's your demographic ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
In terms of psychographic -- oh ,COMMA men and women :COLON men and women are almost equally matched in Second Life ,COMMA so about 45 percent of the people online right now on Second Life are women .PERIOD <BREAK>
In terms of psychographic ,COMMA you know ,COMMA the people in Second Life are remarkably dissimilar relative to what you might think ,COMMA when you go in and talk to them and meet them ,COMMA and I would ,COMMA you know ,COMMA challenge you to just do this and find out .PERIOD <BREAK>
If you count ,COMMA yeah ,COMMA cities .PERIOD So -- but I did -- and I didn't do -- I think I didn't do as well in school as I could have .PERIOD I think you're right .PERIOD <BREAK>
Yeah ,COMMA so let me restate that .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA you're saying that in the pamphlet there's a statement that we may come to prefer our digital selves to our real ones -- our more malleable or manageable digital identities to our real identities -- and that in fact ,COMMA much of human life and human experience may move into the digital realm .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's a frightening change ,COMMA frightening disruption .PERIOD <BREAK>
I guess ,COMMA and you're asking ,COMMA what do I think about that ?QUESTIONMARK How do I -- JH :COLON What's your response to the people who would say ,COMMA that's horrifying ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
(Audience :COLON If someone would say to you ,COMMA I find that disturbing ,COMMA what would be your response) PR :COLON Well ,COMMA I'd say a couple of things .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA the problem of human diversity ,COMMA like all big scientific questions -- how do you explain something like that -- can be broken down into sub-questions .PERIOD <BREAK>
What we're asking about though is human ancestry .PERIOD <BREAK>
Digging things up out of the ground ,COMMA and largely on the basis of morphology -- the way things are shaped ,COMMA often skull shape -- saying ,COMMA This looks a little bit more like us than that ,COMMA so this must be my ancestor .PERIOD <BREAK>
You think you've got a tough job ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA a quick primer on DNA .PERIOD <BREAK>
Mitochondrial DNA ,COMMA tracing a purely maternal line of descent .PERIOD <BREAK>
Turn them on their sides ,COMMA combine them so that they look like a tree with the root at the bottom and the branches going up .PERIOD <BREAK>
Was it millions of years ago ,COMMA which we might suspect by looking at all this incredible variation around the world ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Why was it that we seem to have come out of Africa so recently ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
What was going on to the world's weather around 60000 years ago ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
The reason for that is that ice actually sucks moisture out of the atmosphere .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA at the risk of offending any paleoanthropologists or physical anthropologists in the audience ,COMMA basically there's not a lot of change between these two stone tool groups .PERIOD <BREAK>
Well ,COMMA you want the ultimate African success story ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Look in the mirror .PERIOD You're it .PERIOD The reason you're alive today is because of those changes in our brains that took place in Africa -- probably somewhere in the region where we're sitting right now ,COMMA around 60 ,COMMA 70 thousand years ago -- allowing us not only to survive in Africa ,COMMA but to expand out of Africa .PERIOD <BREAK>
These would have been savannah hunters .PERIOD <BREAK>
Entering Europe around 35000 years ago ,COMMA and finally ,COMMA a small group migrating up through the worst weather imaginable ,COMMA Siberia ,COMMA inside the Arctic Circle ,COMMA during the last ice age -- temperature was at - 70 ,COMMA - 80 ,COMMA even - 100 ,COMMA perhaps -- migrating into the Americas ,COMMA ultimately reaching that final frontier .PERIOD <BREAK>
The changes that allowed us to do that ,COMMA the evolution of this highly adaptable brain that we all carry around with us ,COMMA allowing us to create novel cultures ,COMMA allowing us to develop the diversity that we see on a whirlwind trip like the one I've just been on .PERIOD <BREAK>
The field research that we're doing around the world with indigenous peoples .PERIOD <BREAK>
The Human Genome Project ,COMMA or a Mars Rover mission .PERIOD <BREAK>
In this case ,COMMA you actually can .PERIOD <BREAK>
And you'll now see the yolk and the white have separated .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we all know in our heart of hearts that this is not the way the universe works .PERIOD <BREAK>
And yet ,COMMA look around us .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now we move forward 380000 years .PERIOD <BREAK>
But that's not completely true .PERIOD <BREAK>
Recent studies by satellites such as the WMAP satellite have shown that ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA there are just tiny differences in that background .PERIOD <BREAK>
We have our first stars .PERIOD <BREAK>
So we've crossed a fourth threshold of complexity .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA it copies itself and scatters the templates through the ocean .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that's why ,COMMA as a species ,COMMA we're so creative and so powerful ,COMMA and that's why we have a history .PERIOD <BREAK>
And then from about 500 years ago ,COMMA humans began to link up globally through shipping ,COMMA through trains ,COMMA through telegraph ,COMMA through the Internet ,COMMA until now we seem to form a single global brain of almost seven billion individuals .PERIOD <BREAK>
We've been on a journey ,COMMA a return journey ,COMMA of 137 billion years .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it's a story in which humans play an astonishing and creative role .PERIOD <BREAK>
Collective learning is a very ,COMMA very powerful force ,COMMA and it's not clear that we humans are in charge of it .PERIOD <BREAK>
The program ,COMMA in a sense ,COMMA is an example of behavioral finance on steroids -- how we could really use behavioral finance .PERIOD <BREAK>
How many of you have iPhones ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And that's what I really want to focus on today .PERIOD <BREAK>
And what I'm going to talk about today is Save More Tomorrow .PERIOD <BREAK>
First thing to notice is ,COMMA half of them do not even have access to a 401 plan .PERIOD <BREAK>
And they get overwhelmed and the just don't join .PERIOD <BREAK>
Suppose we had another wonderful TED event next week .PERIOD <BREAK>
The same people that imagined themselves eating the bananas ended up eating chocolates a week later .PERIOD <BREAK>
Self-control is not a problem in the future .PERIOD <BREAK>
Nobody checks boxes .PERIOD <BREAK>
We're going to talk about what happens if people are overwhelmed and scared to make their 401 choices .PERIOD <BREAK>
They're really mad .PERIOD <BREAK>
We first implemented it ,COMMA Richard Thaler and I ,COMMA back in 1998 .PERIOD <BREAK>
We invited them to save three percentage points more every time they get a pay raise .PERIOD <BREAK>
We're seeing here a three and a half-year period ,COMMA four pay raises ,COMMA people who were struggling to save ,COMMA were saving three percent of their paycheck ,COMMA three and a half years later saving almost four times as much ,COMMA almost 14 percent .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's been part of the Pension Protection Act .PERIOD <BREAK>

Here's a song we like to think of as the future anthem of TED .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the third said ,COMMA Let's find another director .PERIOD <BREAK>
So how many people who saw the film did not get that here was a woman in love ,COMMA that she was completely innocent and saw great joy in her life ,COMMA and she was youthful ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And how many of you did not get that ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
It's a symbolic gesture .PERIOD I tear up the script ,COMMA I go and I panic myself ,COMMA I get scared .PERIOD <BREAK>
Get rid of your mind .PERIOD <BREAK>
In Delhi ,COMMA we used to live -- we used to call it a chhat or the khota .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I don't know why ,COMMA but I remember the story .PERIOD <BREAK>
There was a woodcutter who's about to take his ax and chop a piece of wood ,COMMA and the whole galaxy is one atom of that ax .PERIOD <BREAK>
And when that ax hits that piece of wood ,COMMA that's when everything will destroy and the Big Bang will happen again .PERIOD <BREAK>
But all before that there was a woodcutter .PERIOD <BREAK>
So every time ,COMMA I could tell my story again and again and get over this problem ,COMMA and so I got over the problem .PERIOD <BREAK>
If we do not create the stories ,COMMA we probably go mad .PERIOD <BREAK>
Are you with child ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
You ask my permission before you rut ,COMMA before you breed .PERIOD <BREAK>
Elizabeth :COLON This man has seduced a ward of the queen ,COMMA and she has married without royal consent .PERIOD <BREAK>
Remember the word I said ,COMMA suck up .PERIOD <BREAK>
But I can go on about telling you how we evolve stories ,COMMA and how stories effectively are who we are and how these get translated into the particular discipline that I am in ,COMMA which is film .PERIOD <BREAK>
We're born for them .PERIOD <BREAK>
The children's television host Mr .PERIOD Rogers always carried in his wallet a quote from a social worker that said ,COMMA Frankly ,COMMA there isn't anyone you couldn't learn to love once you've heard their story .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the way I like to interpret that is probably the greatest story commandment ,COMMA which is Make me care -- please ,COMMA emotionally ,COMMA intellectually ,COMMA aesthetically ,COMMA just make me care .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so if I were going to give you the ending of this story ,COMMA it would go something like this :COLON And that's what ultimately led me to speaking to you here at TED about story .PERIOD <BREAK>
He insisted ,COMMA no embalming ,COMMA no open coffin ,COMMA no funeral .PERIOD <BREAK>
It didn't happen to me ,COMMA it happened to somebody else ,COMMA but it's going to be worth your time .PERIOD <BREAK>
♫ And that is all ♫ ♫ that love's about ♫ ♫ And we'll recall ♫ ♫ when time runs out ♫ ♫ That it only ♫ AS :COLON Storytelling without dialogue .PERIOD <BREAK>
It confirmed something I really had a hunch on ,COMMA is that the audience actually wants to work for their meal .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it's something that always drove all his choices .PERIOD <BREAK>
Wall-E's was to find the beauty .PERIOD <BREAK>
Sometimes you can make some horrible choices with them .PERIOD <BREAK>
But a major threshold is passed when you mature enough to acknowledge what drives you and to take the wheel and steer it .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that's why change is fundamental in story .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it's interesting to see how that led us places that were actually pretty good .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we got a hold of that fax .PERIOD <BREAK>
And when an artist does that to another artist ,COMMA it's like you're compelled to pass it on .PERIOD <BREAK>
I was going to help alleviate poverty .PERIOD <BREAK>
We paid two to three times more than anybody else .PERIOD <BREAK>
We may have some innovative ,COMMA new ideas .PERIOD <BREAK>
There's no more of it .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is where we stand today .PERIOD <BREAK>
And then we need to use less again .PERIOD <BREAK>
Okay ,COMMA so let's be generous .PERIOD <BREAK>
How do you evaluate all the scientific data around a product ,COMMA the data that's changing on a weekly ,COMMA if not a daily ,COMMA basis ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
How is a consumer going to walk through this minefield ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
These are the 15 commodities that fundamentally pose the biggest threats to these places because of deforestation ,COMMA soil loss ,COMMA water use ,COMMA pesticide use ,COMMA over-fishing ,COMMA etc .PERIOD <BREAK>
Are we going to work with 15 billion producers ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
If we work with those ,COMMA if we change those companies and the way they do business ,COMMA then the rest will happen automatically .PERIOD <BREAK>
Because if these companies demand sustainable products ,COMMA they'll pull 40 to 50 percent of production .PERIOD <BREAK>
By companies asking for this ,COMMA we can leverage production so much faster than by waiting for consumers to do it .PERIOD <BREAK>
After 40 years ,COMMA the global organic movement has achieved 07 of one percent of global food .PERIOD <BREAK>
We can't wait that long .PERIOD <BREAK>
We need change that's going to accelerate .PERIOD <BREAK>
So it's the demand that brings them to the table .PERIOD <BREAK>
So we're pulling out all the stops .PERIOD <BREAK>
They're doing it with IBM and the USDA ,COMMA and they're putting it in the public domain because they want everybody to have access to this data ,COMMA because they want everybody to help them make cocoa more productive and more sustainable .PERIOD <BREAK>
If you divide the amount of water into what the farmer was paid ,COMMA the farmer didn't receive enough money to pay a decent price for water in any of those commodities .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is called bundling .PERIOD It's bringing those externalities back into the price of the commodity .PERIOD <BREAK>
We can't just focus on identifying the best ;SEMICOLON we've got to move the rest .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I'm honored to meet you ,COMMA the future leaders of Great Britain and this world .PERIOD <BREAK>
And my mother ,COMMA the most important role model in my life ,COMMA who lives with us at the White House and helps to care for our two little daughters ,COMMA Malia and Sasha .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's why all of this that you're going through -- the ups and the downs ,COMMA the teachers that you love and the teachers that you don't -- why it's so important .PERIOD <BREAK>
And having done so ,COMMA these women moved many obstacles .PERIOD <BREAK>
I liked being smart .PERIOD <BREAK>
I liked being on time .PERIOD I liked getting my work done .PERIOD <BREAK>
History proves that it doesn't matter whether you come from a council estate or a country estate .PERIOD <BREAK>
In the White House ,COMMA there's the desk that he sits at -- it's called the Resolute desk .PERIOD <BREAK>
She is a world-class soprano singer who studied in Rochester ,COMMA New York .PERIOD <BREAK>
For me ,COMMA the human voice is the vessel on which all emotions travel -- except perhaps jealousy .PERIOD <BREAK>
When you're totally in the moment ,COMMA when I'm totally in the moment ,COMMA the vessel of expression is open .PERIOD <BREAK>
The emotions can flow from me to you and back .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's called Aria .PERIOD <BREAK>
For example ,COMMA there are different colors and each color gets a different type of singing -- pop ,COMMA country and western ,COMMA opera ,COMMA jazz -- and you just have to be consistent with that color .PERIOD <BREAK>
They had one great limitation and one great freedom as they tried to conceive of a global network .PERIOD <BREAK>
So unusual ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA that it was said that it's not clear the Internet could work .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA of course ,COMMA in a mosh pit it's hard to specify a destination .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is a system that relies on kindness and trust ,COMMA which also makes it very delicate and vulnerable .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA for example ,COMMA last year ,COMMA the government of Pakistan asked its Internet service providers there to prevent citizens of Pakistan from seeing YouTube .PERIOD <BREAK>
And here is the message where one of them says ,COMMA Looks like we've got a live one .PERIOD We have a hijacking of YouTube !EXCLAMATIONMARK <BREAK>
And today ,COMMA Wikipedia is so ubiquitous that you can now find it on Chinese restaurant menus .PERIOD <BREAK>
I am not making this up .PERIOD <BREAK>
And there are a bunch of people who ,COMMA on a sunny day ,COMMA would rather be inside and monitoring this ,COMMA the administrator's notice board ,COMMA itself a wiki page that anyone can edit .PERIOD <BREAK>
There are spambots crawling it ,COMMA trying to turn every article into an ad for a Rolex watch .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's something they feel impelled to do because they care about it .PERIOD <BREAK>
Here is just a snapshot of some of them .PERIOD <BREAK>
If you do ,COMMA it will be removed immediately ,COMMA removed by people who may have disagreed with the original decision ,COMMA but respect the outcome and work to make it stay because they believe in something bigger than their own opinion .PERIOD <BREAK>
I mean ,COMMA this is a 2005 Business Week cover .PERIOD <BREAK>
Yeah ,COMMA I know .PERIOD Number four ,COMMA it's like ,COMMA can you imagine coming home to that cat everyday ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
This one says ,COMMA Bucolic meadow with split-rail fence .PERIOD <BREAK>
And then have technology that the person taking the photo will know later ,COMMA this person requested to be contacted before this goes anywhere big ,COMMA if you don't mind .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that person taking the photo can make a decision about how and whether to respect it .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we now have means that we can build ,COMMA like this system ,COMMA so that people can report the filtering as they encounter it .PERIOD <BREAK>
Why ?QUESTIONMARK There is the Craigslist rideshare board .PERIOD <BREAK>
If it were called the Craigslist hitchhiking board ,COMMA tumbleweeds would be blowing through it .PERIOD <BREAK>
But it's the rideshare board ,COMMA and it's basically the same thing .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's a bee that ,COMMA yes ,COMMA flies .PERIOD <BREAK>
We all live in the same planet ,COMMA but there's still a great deal of poverty in the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
And by and large ,COMMA this has failed .PERIOD <BREAK>
Aid actually did the opposite .PERIOD <BREAK>
So 12 years ago ,COMMA I was trying to be an investment banker in New York .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it reminded me of a day in 1971 .PERIOD <BREAK>
And after all ,COMMA poor countries ,COMMA like rich countries ,COMMA one thing we've got equal ,COMMA is their days are the same length :COLON 24 hours .PERIOD <BREAK>
The question was ,COMMA how much did it cost to install a new telephone in Bangladesh ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
It turns out :COLON 2000 dollars .PERIOD <BREAK>
And of course ,COMMA if the cost of installing a telephone is going down ,COMMA because there's a digital revolution going on ,COMMA then it would be even more dramatic .PERIOD <BREAK>
But in any event ,COMMA it's connectivity that leads to dependability .PERIOD <BREAK>
There were a lot of reasons people told me why we don't have enough telephones .PERIOD <BREAK>
The work pays them a salary ;SEMICOLON the salary allows them to pay for the car over time .PERIOD <BREAK>
The car pays for itself .PERIOD <BREAK>
See ,COMMA you need some kind of infrastructure to bring a new thing .PERIOD <BREAK>
For instance ,COMMA the Internet was booming in the US .PERIOD <BREAK>
And she sells the milk to the villagers ,COMMA and pays off the loan .PERIOD <BREAK>
And these phones are generating about 100 million dollars for the company .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's just an experiment .PERIOD <BREAK>
I was a guest student during one month of a public health course .PERIOD <BREAK>
They read the textbook twice ,COMMA or three times or four times .PERIOD <BREAK>
And they were the first to Twitter transatlantically .PERIOD <BREAK>
Those are nice words .PERIOD But I got sort of curious of what he meant with liberty ,COMMA and liberty for whom .PERIOD <BREAK>
But really ,COMMA really natural sovereignty was good for Japan .PERIOD <BREAK>
In 1947 India finally gained its independence .PERIOD <BREAK>
You can see that the health started to improve .PERIOD <BREAK>
In ' 92 India follows with a market reform .PERIOD <BREAK>
And they go quite closely together ,COMMA and you can see that the similarity with India and China ,COMMA in many ways ,COMMA are greater than the differences with them .PERIOD <BREAK>
Kerala is flying on top there ,COMMA matching United States in health ,COMMA but not in economy .PERIOD <BREAK>
We have an enormous disparity in the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
You see ,COMMA China under foreign domination actually lowered their income and came down to the Indian level here .PERIOD <BREAK>
Japan did it like this ,COMMA until full catch up ,COMMA and then they follow with the other high-income economies .PERIOD <BREAK>
Can be worse ,COMMA can be better .PERIOD <BREAK>
But more recently ,COMMA I've been turning my attention to the universe on the largest scale .PERIOD <BREAK>
By invisible ,COMMA I mean it doesn't absorb in the electromagnetic spectrum .PERIOD <BREAK>
When those measurements are made ,COMMA instead what we find is that the speed is basically constant ,COMMA as a function of distance .PERIOD <BREAK>
In fact ,COMMA this galaxy and every other galaxy appears to be embedded in a cloud of this invisible dark matter .PERIOD <BREAK>
It would be nice if we could see this dark matter a little bit more directly .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA how do we deduce where the galaxy is ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Where will this observer see the galaxy ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
So there's a whole ray of light -- rays of light on a cone -- that will all be bent by that cluster and make it into the observer's eye .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA actually ,COMMA at home ,COMMA whenever we break a wineglass ,COMMA I save the bottom ,COMMA take it over to the machine shop .PERIOD <BREAK>
We shave it off ,COMMA and I have a little gravitational lens ,COMMA OK .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we see these gravitational lensing effects ,COMMA these distortions that say that ,COMMA again ,COMMA clusters are embedded in dark matter .PERIOD <BREAK>
They're moving away from each other because space itself is getting bigger ,COMMA OK .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA in the last century ,COMMA OK ,COMMA people debated about whether this expansion of space would continue forever ;SEMICOLON whether it would slow down ,COMMA you know ,COMMA will be slowing down ,COMMA but continue forever ;SEMICOLON slow down and stop ,COMMA asymptotically stop ;SEMICOLON or slow down ,COMMA stop ,COMMA and then reverse ,COMMA so it starts to contract again .PERIOD <BREAK>
By how much less is it expanding today ,COMMA compared to ,COMMA say ,COMMA a couple of billion years ago ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
So we need something to be able to explain that .PERIOD <BREAK>
But we don't know if either of those are actually the dark matter candidate ,COMMA OK .PERIOD <BREAK>
They haven't seen anything ,COMMA OK ,COMMA but it puts limits on what the mass and the interaction strength of these dark matter particles are .PERIOD <BREAK>
There's going to be a satellite telescope launched later this year and it will look towards the middle of the galaxy ,COMMA to see if we can see dark matter particles annihilating and producing gamma rays that could be detected with this .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA unfortunately ,COMMA there is a lot of new physics whose signature could be missing energy ,COMMA so it will be hard to tell the difference .PERIOD <BREAK>
And finally ,COMMA for future endeavors ,COMMA there are telescopes being designed specifically to address the questions of dark matter and dark energy -- ground-based telescopes ,COMMA and there are three space-based telescopes that are in competition right now to be launched to investigate dark matter and dark energy .PERIOD <BREAK>
And over the course of half an hour ,COMMA not one syringe was filmed being unwrapped .PERIOD <BREAK>
They started with two and they ended with two .PERIOD <BREAK>
In China ,COMMA recycling is a major issue .PERIOD <BREAK>
And they use them ,COMMA in the breaks ,COMMA for water pistols .PERIOD <BREAK>
And they are having great fun .PERIOD <BREAK>
And they squirt the water into their mouths .PERIOD <BREAK>
You load it up in the normal way .PERIOD This is made on existing equipment in 14 factories that we license .PERIOD <BREAK>
Imagine that orchestration .PERIOD <BREAK>
This happens every year .PERIOD <BREAK>
And one time he came up to me -- he was about seven or eight years old -- he came up to me .PERIOD <BREAK>
And there was a wasp's nest that I had let grow in my yard ,COMMA right outside my door .PERIOD <BREAK>
And like ,COMMA knock like a woodpecker on my door until I opened it up .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I told him ,COMMA You know ,COMMA Cody ,COMMA the wasps actually made that .PERIOD <BREAK>
They're the people who make the bullet train .PERIOD <BREAK>
And those bumps act like a magnet for water .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the fog comes in and it builds up on the tips .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now it's reversing that equation ,COMMA and actually sequestering half a ton of CO 2 thanks to the recipe from the coral .PERIOD <BREAK>
They actually export water molecules through .PERIOD <BREAK>
And those scalloped edges play with flow in such a way that is reduces drag by 32 percent .PERIOD <BREAK>
The question is -- biomimicry is an incredibly powerful way to innovate .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we are in a long ,COMMA long line of organisms to come to this planet and ask ourselves ,COMMA How can we live here gracefully over the long haul ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Now in order to do this ,COMMA the design challenge of our century ,COMMA I think ,COMMA we need a way to remind ourselves of those geniuses ,COMMA and to somehow meet them again .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we're working with EOL ,COMMA Encyclopedia of Life ,COMMA Ed Wilson's TED wish .PERIOD <BREAK>
And this is a pretty well-educated audience ,COMMA so I imagine you all know something about AIDS .PERIOD <BREAK>
If you know something more ,COMMA you probably know that Uganda ,COMMA to date ,COMMA is the only country in sub-Saharan Africa that has had success in combating the epidemic .PERIOD <BREAK>
But I'm going to use tools and ideas that are familiar to economists to think about a problem that's more traditionally part of public health and epidemiology .PERIOD <BREAK>
We see almost no change in sexual behavior .PERIOD <BREAK>
AIDS is the same kind of thing .PERIOD It's costly to avoid AIDS .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the way that I'm going to do that is ,COMMA I'm going to look across areas with different levels of malaria .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so people who live in areas with a lot of malaria are going to have lower life expectancy than people who live in areas with limited malaria .PERIOD <BREAK>
Even if you only cared about AIDS in Africa ,COMMA it might still be a good idea to invest in malaria ,COMMA in combating poor indoor air quality ,COMMA in improving maternal mortality rates .PERIOD <BREAK>
If people have no incentive to avoid AIDS on their own ,COMMA even if they know everything about the disease ,COMMA they still may not change their behavior .PERIOD <BREAK>
We know they had this campaign .PERIOD That's how we learn about what works .PERIOD <BREAK>
So this is another way to see this .PERIOD <BREAK>
So I am going to talk about exports and prices .PERIOD <BREAK>
But openness and inter-connectedness ,COMMA it comes with a cost when we think about disease .PERIOD I don't think this should be a surprise .PERIOD <BREAK>
Areas with a lot of economic activity -- with a lot of roads ,COMMA with a lot of urbanization -- those areas have higher prevalence than others .PERIOD <BREAK>
And what's really ,COMMA really great about being here is I'm sure that the questions that you guys have are very ,COMMA very different than the questions that I think up myself .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's great being here at TED .PERIOD <BREAK>
Their relationship is a love story that feeds the Earth .PERIOD <BREAK>
It reminds us that we are a part of nature ,COMMA and we're not separate from it .PERIOD <BREAK>
Well ,COMMA their answer was ,COMMA It's all about risk and reward .PERIOD <BREAK>
And Chip Taylor ,COMMA our monarch butterfly expert ,COMMA he replied ,COMMA Nothing lasts forever .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that blew my mind .PERIOD <BREAK>
We were four girls and no boys .PERIOD <BREAK>
I don't know if he really meant [that] ,COMMA but it happened .PERIOD <BREAK>
Out of 100 ,COMMA 90 are your creation .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is about tough policing ,COMMA equal policing .PERIOD <BREAK>
I now went to a prison assignment as a police officer .PERIOD <BREAK>
Here I got a prison assignment .PERIOD <BREAK>
Obviously ,COMMA it was .PERIOD <BREAK>
And then how did I deal with them ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
The first day when I went in ,COMMA I didn't know how to look at them .PERIOD <BREAK>
I said ,COMMA Do you pray ?QUESTIONMARK Do you want to pray ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
I think that's the bigger change .PERIOD <BREAK>
Teachers were prisoners .PERIOD Teachers were volunteers .PERIOD <BREAK>
You want to know more about this ,COMMA go and see this film ,COMMA Doing Time ,COMMA Doing Vipassana .PERIOD <BREAK>
Let me wrap it up .PERIOD <BREAK>
But the best part is the message that the Yahoo help desk got about 20 minutes later .PERIOD <BREAK>
CAPTCHA Project is something that we did here at Carnegie Melllon over 10 years ago ,COMMA and it's been used everywhere .PERIOD <BREAK>
So then I started feeling bad .PERIOD <BREAK>
So can we get you to do useful work for those 10 seconds ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
So you start with a book ,COMMA and then you scan it .PERIOD <BREAK>
For example ,COMMA for things that were written more than 50 years ago ,COMMA the computer cannot recognize about 30 percent of the words .PERIOD <BREAK>
JohnEdwardscom So we keep on insulting people left and right everyday .PERIOD <BREAK>
There are tens of thousands of these .PERIOD <BREAK>
Some of them are very cute .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it is numbers like these that motivate my research agenda .PERIOD <BREAK>
It hasn't yet been launched .PERIOD It's called Duolingo .PERIOD <BREAK>
It started with me posing a question to my graduate student ,COMMA Severin Hacker .PERIOD <BREAK>
Actually it was a forum post .PERIOD <BREAK>
Remember ,COMMA it's a question about JavaScript .PERIOD <BREAK>
Okay ,COMMA so computer translation ,COMMA not yet good enough .PERIOD <BREAK>
We could pay professional language translators to translate the whole Web .PERIOD <BREAK>
We could do that .PERIOD <BREAK>
If we wanted to translate the other 80 percent into Spanish ,COMMA it would cost at least 50 million dollars -- and this is at even the most exploited ,COMMA outsourcing country out there .PERIOD <BREAK>
So it would be very expensive .PERIOD <BREAK>
For example ,COMMA in the United States alone ,COMMA there are over five million people who have paid over $ 500 for software to learn a new language .PERIOD <BREAK>
There's ,COMMA of course ,COMMA a lot of very simple sentences on the Web .PERIOD <BREAK>
Since all the projects that my group has worked on so far have gotten millions of users ,COMMA we're hopeful that we'll be able to translate extremely fast with this project .PERIOD <BREAK>
So here's the site .PERIOD <BREAK>
But then by the end of the decade ,COMMA the country had fallen back into political instability and mismanagement .PERIOD <BREAK>
We the children had gathered at a friend's house .PERIOD <BREAK>
I wanted to document on film the 2008 presidential elections .PERIOD <BREAK>
And there ,COMMA I started by searching for the footprints in my childhood .PERIOD <BREAK>
The polling stations opened to the voters at 700 AM ,COMMA but voters ,COMMA eager to take their own political fate into their hands ,COMMA were starting to line up at 400 AM in the morning .PERIOD <BREAK>
They were chanting ,COMMA We want peace .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now the uphill battle for Ghana and for Africa is not over ,COMMA but I have proof that the other side of democracy exists ,COMMA and that we must not take it for granted .PERIOD <BREAK>
That -- you know ,COMMA I was born thinking about things that way ,COMMA and I had always been like a little scientist guy .PERIOD <BREAK>
And people in the 17 th century ,COMMA they didn't really understand the same way we do about you know ,COMMA this stuff is a bunch of different kinds of molecules ,COMMA and we breathe it in for a purpose and all that .PERIOD <BREAK>
And Boyle said ,COMMA bullshit .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so ,COMMA Charles said ,COMMA I'm going to put up the money give you guys a building ,COMMA come here and you can meet in the building ,COMMA but just don't talk about religion in there .PERIOD <BREAK>
But experimental science had been tied up with all those things .PERIOD <BREAK>
Kary Mullis :COLON They might have done it for the teddy bear ,COMMA yeah .PERIOD <BREAK>
I thought that anybody with any brains will do it that way .PERIOD <BREAK>
I was thinking about making my own little rockets .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's why I thought ,COMMA as long as I don't blow my eyes out .PERIOD <BREAK>
I may not care about the fact that it's prohibited from heating this solution .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'm sure it's got to do with rockets or it wouldn't be in that manual .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it -- they burned .PERIOD <BREAK>
At any rate ,COMMA I bring it up because it's a good story ,COMMA and he said ,COMMA tell personal things ,COMMA you know ,COMMA and that's a personal -- I was going to tell you about the first night that I met my wife ,COMMA but that would be too personal ,COMMA wouldn't it .PERIOD <BREAK>
But in the actual process ,COMMA you get an idea -- like ,COMMA when I got the idea one night that I could amplify DNA with two oligonucleotides ,COMMA and I could make lots of copies of some little piece of DNA ,COMMA you know ,COMMA the thinking for that was about 20 minutes while I was driving my car ,COMMA and then instead of going -- I went back and I did talk to people about it ,COMMA but if I'd listened to what I heard from all my friends who were molecular biologists -- I would have abandoned it .PERIOD <BREAK>
But I knew ,COMMA you'd go into the lab and you'd try to make it work yourself .PERIOD And then you're the authority ,COMMA and you can say ,COMMA I know it works ,COMMA because right there in that tube is where it happened ,COMMA and here ,COMMA on this gel ,COMMA there's a little band there that I know that's DNA ,COMMA and that's the DNA I wanted to amplify ,COMMA so there !EXCLAMATIONMARK So it does work .PERIOD <BREAK>
So you have to be honest .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA let's see .PERIOD <BREAK>
They made bigger guns to shoot them down with .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the people I'm talking about are people that like -- they say that they're a member of the committee called ,COMMA say ,COMMA the Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change .PERIOD <BREAK>
So the planet should get warmer .PERIOD <BREAK>
So the planet is a pretty amazing thing ,COMMA you know ,COMMA it's big and horrible -- and big and wonderful ,COMMA and it does all kinds of things we don't know anything about .PERIOD <BREAK>
In New York City ,COMMA rats are part of commuters' daily lives .PERIOD <BREAK>
I was very fond of this space because it's the first massive industrial complex I found on my own that is abandoned .PERIOD <BREAK>
The nature had really reclaimed the whole complex .PERIOD <BREAK>
I was really frightened at first ,COMMA but I calmly explained to him that I was working on an art project and he didn't seem to mind and so I went ahead and put my camera on self-timer and ran back and forth .PERIOD <BREAK>
That homeless man ,COMMA to me ,COMMA really represented an element of the unconscious of the city .PERIOD <BREAK>
They were consistently dug as limestone quarries and by the 18 th century ,COMMA the caving-in of some of these quarries posed safety threats ,COMMA so the government ordered reinforcing of the existing quarries and dug new observation tunnels in order to monitor and map the whole place .PERIOD <BREAK>
As you can see ,COMMA the system is very complex and vast .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'm going to try and explain why it is that perhaps we don't understand as much as we think we do .PERIOD <BREAK>
I think we agree on that .PERIOD Where does the tree get the stuff that makes up this chair ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK Where does all this stuff come from ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And would you be able to ,COMMA kind of ,COMMA draw a -- you don't have to draw the diagram ,COMMA but would you be able to draw the diagram ,COMMA if you had to do it ?QUESTIONMARK Or would you just say ,COMMA that's actually not possible ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
That's what plants actually do for a living .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA these mental models -- we look for evidence that reinforces our models .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it's amateur ,COMMA but amateur in the best sense ,COMMA in other words ,COMMA the root of the word being of love and passion .PERIOD <BREAK>
And governments do very well .PERIOD They pat themselves on the back .PERIOD <BREAK>
OK ?QUESTIONMARK We collude ,COMMA and actually if you -- if someone had designed a test for me when I was doing my biology exams ,COMMA to really understand ,COMMA to see whether I'd understood more than just kind of putting starch and iodine together and seeing it go blue ,COMMA and really understood that plants took their mass out of the air ,COMMA then I might have done better at science .PERIOD <BREAK>
I love manipulating the infrastructure of biology .PERIOD <BREAK>
But within that infrastructure ,COMMA we have to remember that the driving force of biology is really coming from evolution .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is a dead crystal ,COMMA and I'm going to do something to it ,COMMA and it's going to become alive .PERIOD <BREAK>
But there's a problem ,COMMA because up until maybe a decade ago ,COMMA we were told that life was impossible and that we were the most incredible miracle in the universe .PERIOD <BREAK>
If we can make matter alive ,COMMA would we have a matterhazard ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Chemists are trying to study the molecules to look at disease .PERIOD <BREAK>
You can decode the genome ,COMMA you can look back ,COMMA you can link us all together by a mitochondrial DNA ,COMMA but we can't get further than the last ancestor ,COMMA the last visible cell that we could sequence or think back in history .PERIOD <BREAK>
What is life ?QUESTIONMARK What is this stuff of life ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
So the whole area's been stuck for a while ,COMMA and it got reignited in the ' 80 s when analytical technologies and computer technologies were coming on .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the answer ,COMMA of course ,COMMA lies with mice .PERIOD <BREAK>
They're all made of the same stuff ,COMMA but they want their shape to win .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that is the key .PERIOD <BREAK>
Let's zoom out to what that could mean .PERIOD <BREAK>
If we could get evolution into the material world ,COMMA then I propose we should have a general theory of evolution .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that's really worth thinking about .PERIOD <BREAK>
So that means we could then start to develop different platforms for exploring this evolution .PERIOD <BREAK>
So you imagine ,COMMA if we're able to create a self-sustaining artificial life form ,COMMA not only will this tell us about the origin of life -- that it's possible that the universe doesn't need carbon to be alive ;SEMICOLON it can use anything -- we can then take [it] one step further and develop new technologies ,COMMA because we can then use software control for evolution to code in .PERIOD <BREAK>
But not only just that ,COMMA we will start to think about how we can start to develop a symbiotic relationship with biology .PERIOD <BREAK>
Evolution cannot be cut apart .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we're really becoming very close to understanding the key steps that makes dead stuff come alive .PERIOD <BREAK>
We are here today because [the] United Nations have defined goals for the progress of countries .PERIOD <BREAK>
Look here -- you have to end poverty ,COMMA education ,COMMA gender ,COMMA child and maternal health ,COMMA control infections ,COMMA protect the environment and get the good global links between nations in every aspect from aid to trade .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's a four percent reduction per year -- and this ,COMMA with measuring .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'll prove them wrong on both points .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I will take Kenya as an example .PERIOD <BREAK>
I was actually ,COMMA on Friday ,COMMA sitting in front of my computer ,COMMA and I saw the death rate fall from 128 to 84 just that morning .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's unfair .PERIOD <BREAK>
Had I been in the Ministry of Health in Kenya ,COMMA I may have joined these two points .PERIOD <BREAK>
So look at the average here -- this is the average for all of sub-Saharan Africa .PERIOD <BREAK>
I give you Congo ,COMMA which was high ,COMMA Ghana -- lower .PERIOD And Kenya -- even lower .PERIOD <BREAK>
Their countries are so different ,COMMA and they merit to be recognized in the same way ,COMMA as we don't talk about Europe as one place .PERIOD <BREAK>
There we are today .PERIOD <BREAK>
How the heck could they be [a] developing country ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Look -- even if we look in Africa -- these are the African countries .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's very clear that this is what happens .PERIOD <BREAK>
That is ,COMMA when we get girls in school ,COMMA we'll get an impact 15 to 20 years later ,COMMA which is a secular trend which is very strong .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's a decent life for children ,COMMA we are talking about .PERIOD <BREAK>
Do we care about those four billion people whose income levels are less than two dollars a day ,COMMA the so-called bottom of the pyramid ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
But if you don't have money ,COMMA what happens ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And if they do so ,COMMA then ,COMMA of course ,COMMA the conditions improve ,COMMA and they start riding on scooters .PERIOD <BREAK>
An innovator is one who does not know it cannot be done .PERIOD <BREAK>
They combine all that .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it was that compassion which bothered them ,COMMA because when he saw -- in fact ,COMMA he told me about eight or nine years ago how he was driving his own car -- he drives his own car by the way -- and he saw in the rain ,COMMA a family like the one that I showed to you getting drenched with an infant .PERIOD <BREAK>
For example ,COMMA how we started :COLON Ratan just began with a five-engineer team ,COMMA young people in their mid-twenties .PERIOD <BREAK>
It was an open innovation ,COMMA ideas from all over were welcome .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the seat riser ,COMMA for example ,COMMA serving as a mounting for the seat as well as a structural part of the functional rigidity .PERIOD <BREAK>
And British Motor was around 11000 .PERIOD <BREAK>
And unbelievably ,COMMA in 40 years ,COMMA I was the first Indian to be honored .PERIOD <BREAK>
And unique high-ankle design and human-like looks ,COMMA [unclear] and functions .PERIOD <BREAK>
Are you getting more drugs because you are spending more time and more money ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
The ideas have to be such that you think in completely different terms .PERIOD <BREAK>
And incubator costs 2000 dollars .PERIOD <BREAK>
But then he held it for a little while ,COMMA Lakshmi .PERIOD <BREAK>
That gave me a great message :COLON focus and you can achieve .PERIOD <BREAK>
And currently I'm president of Global Research Alliance ,COMMA 60000 scientists in nine counties ,COMMA right from India to the US .PERIOD <BREAK>
Commodities are things that you grow in the ground ,COMMA raise on the ground or pull out of the ground :COLON basically ,COMMA animal ,COMMA mineral ,COMMA vegetable .PERIOD <BREAK>
Long-distance telephone service sold on price ,COMMA price ,COMMA price ;SEMICOLON fast-food restaurants with all their value pricing ;SEMICOLON and even the Internet is commoditizing not just goods ,COMMA but services as well .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now most places that I talk to ,COMMA when I talk about experience ,COMMA I talk about Disney -- the world's premier experience-stager .PERIOD <BREAK>
And then I always finish off by talking about -- the thing that amazes me the most about this question ,COMMA particularly coming from the Dutch ,COMMA is that the Netherlands is every bit as manufactured as Disneyland .PERIOD <BREAK>
In fact ,COMMA you can look at how each of these economies developed ,COMMA that each one has their own business imperative ,COMMA matched with a consumer sensibility .PERIOD <BREAK>
Because all businesses are man-made objects ;SEMICOLON all business is involved with money ;SEMICOLON all business is a matter of using machinery ,COMMA and all those things make something inauthentic .PERIOD <BREAK>
At the end of a laundry list of advice he's giving to his son ,COMMA Laertes ,COMMA he says this :COLON And this above all :COLON to thine own self be true .PERIOD <BREAK>
As businesses ,COMMA are the economic offerings you are providing -- are they true to themselves ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And of course ,COMMA if you are both true to yourself ,COMMA and are what you say you are ,COMMA then you're real real !EXCLAMATIONMARK <BREAK>
Universal City Walk is a real fake -- in fact ,COMMA we got this very term from Ada Louise Huxtable's book ,COMMA The Unreal America .PERIOD <BREAK>
But is it really true to itself ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
So she calls it a real fake .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA understand what -- your past limits what you can do in the future .PERIOD <BREAK>
Right ,COMMA if you could check into the ads ,COMMA you'd have a great experience .PERIOD <BREAK>
Then you have that perception that you are phony .PERIOD <BREAK>
A few words about how I got started ,COMMA and it has a lot to do with happiness ,COMMA actually .PERIOD <BREAK>
I would make things for people as a way of ,COMMA you know ,COMMA giving ,COMMA showing them my love .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA it has to end with this -- -- gratuitous violence .PERIOD <BREAK>
So that was how I first started to explore the way things moved ,COMMA and expressed it .PERIOD <BREAK>
I was also very interested in perhaps going into surgery and becoming a surgeon ,COMMA because it meant working with my hands in a very focused ,COMMA intense way .PERIOD <BREAK>
When I see objects ,COMMA I imagine them in motion .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's about that big .PERIOD <BREAK>
This kind of work is also very much like puppetry ,COMMA where the found object is ,COMMA in a sense ,COMMA the puppet ,COMMA and I'm the puppeteer at first ,COMMA because I'm playing with an object .PERIOD <BREAK>
And they would coalesce for just a moment ,COMMA so you could perceive that there was a chair there .PERIOD <BREAK>
What would I love ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
So this is a little wire-bending tool .PERIOD <BREAK>
After many years of bending gears with a pair of pliers ,COMMA I made that tool ,COMMA and then I made this other tool for sort of centering gears very quickly -- sort of developing my own little world of technology .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the idea ,COMMA their premise was that we wanted to show pieces of sculpture on the street ,COMMA and there'd be no subjective decision about what was the best .PERIOD <BREAK>
So I'll just let this chair come down .PERIOD <BREAK>
And what we were going to do was scan a new project on the development of the fetus from conception to birth using these kinds of new technologies .PERIOD <BREAK>
25 Days :COLON Heart chamber developing 32 Days :COLON Arms &amp ;SEMICOLON hands are developing 36 Days :COLON Beginning of the primitive vertabrae These weeks are the period of the most rapid development of the fetus .PERIOD <BREAK>
51 Days 52 Days :COLON Developing retina ,COMMA nose and fingers The fetus' continual movement in the womb is necessary for muscular and skeletal growth .PERIOD <BREAK>
Every six months until they're six years old -- we're going to be doing actually to about 250 children -- watching exactly how the gyri and the sulci of the brains fold to see how this magnificent development actually turns into memories and the marvel that is us .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'm a spectroscopist .PERIOD <BREAK>
Sometimes we have to deal with just one tiny ,COMMA weak spectral line to measure the composition of that chemical element in the atmosphere .PERIOD <BREAK>
For instance ,COMMA you see the spectral line of the gold is the only spectral line in the spectrum of the Sun .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's a heavy element produced in thermonuclear explosions of supernovae .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's the only place where you can produce ,COMMA actually ,COMMA osmium .PERIOD <BREAK>
It was incredible .PERIOD The only conclusion we could make from this is clear evidence that there was a supernova explosion in this system ,COMMA which polluted the atmosphere of this star .PERIOD <BREAK>
They actually said that one of the stars you see in the spectra is an alien .PERIOD It comes from a different galaxy .PERIOD <BREAK>
And sometimes they just capture stars .PERIOD <BREAK>
We were very surprised to discover a super flare ,COMMA a flare which is thousands of millions of times more powerful than those we see in the Sun .PERIOD <BREAK>
This can be done with the future spectrographs .PERIOD <BREAK>
Coming back to the most important question ,COMMA Is there anybody out there ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Connection between life and radioactive nuclei is straightforward .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's exactly the same game .PERIOD A very tiny feature .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's amazing that we can detect vegetation from a spectrum .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now very recently ,COMMA very recently ,COMMA I'm talking about last six ,COMMA seven ,COMMA eight months ,COMMA water ,COMMA methane ,COMMA carbon dioxide have been detected in the spectrum of a planet outside the solar system .PERIOD <BREAK>
And with the known physics etc ,COMMA it's something actually which has been pointed out by Frank Drake ,COMMA many years ago ,COMMA and Shklovsky .PERIOD <BREAK>
They want to actually signal their presence through these spectral lines ,COMMA in the spectrum of a star ,COMMA in different ways .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we are doing this job since 2000 and it's a very heavy project .PERIOD <BREAK>
We have been working very hard .PERIOD <BREAK>
I think it will come from a spectrum like this .PERIOD <BREAK>
It will take about five years .PERIOD <BREAK>
And she said ,COMMA But the thing I liked about your talk is you're a storyteller .PERIOD <BREAK>
And she said ,COMMA I'm going to call you a storyteller .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'm a qualitative researcher .PERIOD <BREAK>
And maybe I'm just a storyteller .PERIOD <BREAK>
The other thing that they had in common was this :COLON They fully embraced vulnerability .PERIOD <BREAK>
They're willing to invest in a relationship that may or may not work out .PERIOD <BREAK>
Do you have any recommendations ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And I said ,COMMA I'm great .PERIOD I'm okay .PERIOD <BREAK>
I just need some strategies .PERIOD <BREAK>
And then I said ,COMMA It's bad ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
The problem is -- and I learned this from the research -- that you cannot selectively numb emotion .PERIOD <BREAK>
You can't numb those hard feelings without numbing the other affects ,COMMA our emotions .PERIOD <BREAK>
Religion has gone from a belief in faith and mystery to certainty .PERIOD <BREAK>
There's no conversation .PERIOD <BREAK>
Which just ,COMMA I hope in 100 years ,COMMA people will look back and go ,COMMA Wow .PERIOD <BREAK>
And when you hold those perfect little babies in your hand ,COMMA our job is not to say ,COMMA Look at her ,COMMA she's perfect .PERIOD <BREAK>
My job is just to keep her perfect -- make sure she makes the tennis team by fifth grade and Yale by seventh grade .PERIOD <BREAK>
We do that in our personal lives .PERIOD <BREAK>
It is ,COMMA as you can see ,COMMA very small and also very cheap .PERIOD <BREAK>
So that when we think about using them to get some systematic improvement ,COMMA we also think about how they can be useful for self-improvement ,COMMA for self-discovery ,COMMA self-awareness ,COMMA self-knowledge .PERIOD <BREAK>
Some people will say it's for public health research .PERIOD <BREAK>
Thank you .PERIOD <BREAK>
I want to talk about it in the context of a story .PERIOD <BREAK>
All of our statuses are different .PERIOD <BREAK>
All of our hopes and dreams ,COMMA what we want to accomplish ,COMMA is different ,COMMA and our paths will be different ,COMMA they are all stories .PERIOD <BREAK>
and go from this concept of walking ,COMMA breathing ,COMMA and then his hands ,COMMA speak ,COMMA and ultimately happiness and function .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we took this ,COMMA and we converted it into data .PERIOD <BREAK>
But it's not a data point at that one moment in time .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA here's Steven alone ,COMMA sharing this story in the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
We need to give to others to be successful .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I'm going to show you what Patients Like Me ,COMMA the company that myself ,COMMA my youngest brother and a good friend from MIT started .PERIOD <BREAK>
But you can aggregate this and you can discover things about treatments .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA you can see the duration .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'm going to log in .PERIOD <BREAK>
And this is a new version of our platform we're launching right now .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'm taking three drugs to manage it .PERIOD Some of them are experimental .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA can I take this data -- rearrange yourself ,COMMA put the symptoms in the left ,COMMA the drugs across the top ,COMMA tell me everything we know about Steven and everyone else ,COMMA and what interacts .PERIOD <BREAK>
Doctors actually love this sheet ,COMMA and they're actually really engaged .PERIOD <BREAK>
Ten percent of the people in our system took lithium .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's never going to work .PERIOD You can't do it .PERIOD <BREAK>
And then we say ,COMMA Well how do we line them all up ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And it works almost every time .PERIOD <BREAK>
And yeah ,COMMA all the clinicians in the audience will talk about power and all the standard deviation .PERIOD We'll do that later .PERIOD <BREAK>
We hired them ,COMMA set them up ,COMMA assisting at lab .PERIOD <BREAK>
Because something went different .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I am thankful .PERIOD <BREAK>
We know what they are .PERIOD <BREAK>
The B 15 iceberg broke off the Ross Ice Shelf .PERIOD <BREAK>
And what if we could get exquisite control over the essence of energy ,COMMA the electron ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
A tremendous amount of energy is coming at us from the sun .PERIOD <BREAK>
Wouldn't it be really great if the window could flick back the heat into the room if we needed it or flick it away before it came in ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
We'd have to see at night ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
But because it's flexible ,COMMA it can be on any surface whatsoever .PERIOD <BREAK>
It was in actually a diner outside of Dallas/Fort Worth Airport .PERIOD <BREAK>
EBox is testing new nanomaterials to park an electron on the outside ,COMMA hold it until you need it ,COMMA and then be able to release it and pass it off .PERIOD <BREAK>
19 trillion dollars is what we're going to have to spend .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'm glad to be working with incredibly brilliant and kind scientists ,COMMA no kinder than many of the people in the world ,COMMA but they have a magic look at the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
By any standard this is wrong .PERIOD <BREAK>
I was two years older than my sister at the time -- I mean ,COMMA I'm two years older than her now -- but at the time it meant she had to do everything that I wanted to do ,COMMA and I wanted to play war .PERIOD <BREAK>
And on the other side were all my sister's My Little Ponies ready for a cavalry charge .PERIOD <BREAK>
I was nervous because my parents had charged me with making sure that my sister and I played as safely and as quietly as possible .PERIOD <BREAK>
with one broken leg .PERIOD <BREAK>
I can delete that dot because that's clearly a measurement error .PERIOD <BREAK>
So one of the very first things we teach people in economics and statistics and business and psychology courses is how ,COMMA in a statistically valid way ,COMMA do we eliminate the weirdos .PERIOD <BREAK>
When I applied to Harvard ,COMMA I applied on a dare .PERIOD <BREAK>
I didn't expect to get in ,COMMA and my family had no money for college .PERIOD <BREAK>
Which I'm glad you liked ,COMMA but they did not like that at all .PERIOD <BREAK>
Here's how we get to health :COLON We need to reverse the formula for happiness and success .PERIOD <BREAK>
Doctors are 19 percent faster ,COMMA more accurate at coming up with the correct diagnosis when positive instead of negative ,COMMA neutral or stressed .PERIOD <BREAK>
What we need to be able to do is to reverse this formula so we can start to see what our brains are actually capable of .PERIOD <BREAK>
Exercise teaches your brain that your behavior matters .PERIOD <BREAK>
And by the way ,COMMA all of these numbers are significantly higher if you happen to be black ,COMMA if you happen to be poor ,COMMA if you happen to exist in an overcrowded school .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so we're starting to see the establishment of men centers and men studies to think about how do we engage men in their experiences in the university .PERIOD <BREAK>
The next reason that boys' cultures are out of sync with school cultures :COLON there are fewer male teachers .PERIOD <BREAK>
But male role models for boys that say it's all right to be smart -- they've got dads ,COMMA they've got pastors ,COMMA they've got Cub Scout leaders ,COMMA but ultimately ,COMMA six hours a day ,COMMA five days a week they're spending in a classroom ,COMMA and most of those classrooms are not places where men exist .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is a place for girls .PERIOD <BREAK>
We have a serious compression of the curriculum happening out there .PERIOD <BREAK>
And if you ask Title 1 teachers ,COMMA they'll tell you they've got about four or five boys for every girl that's in their program ,COMMA in the elementary grades .PERIOD <BREAK>
All of those conversations need to be happening .PERIOD <BREAK>
Who has a computer ?QUESTIONMARK Yeah .PERIOD <BREAK>
OK ,COMMA so ,COMMA everyone has a computer .PERIOD <BREAK>
I went to MIT ,COMMA did my math ,COMMA but I had this wonderful opportunity ,COMMA because computers had just become visual .PERIOD <BREAK>
Remember that moment -- publishing your designs ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
I didn't quite get it .PERIOD And Paul Rand was a kind of crusty designer ,COMMA you know ,COMMA a crusty designer ,COMMA like a good -- kind of like a good French bread ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
This is the first sort of play thing I did ,COMMA my own serious play .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is actually bad :COLON human experiments .PERIOD <BREAK>
See ,COMMA humans don't know how to take orders ;SEMICOLON the computer's so good at it .PERIOD <BREAK>
This guy figured out how to get the computer to draw with two pens at once :COLON you know ,COMMA you ,COMMA pen ,COMMA do this ,COMMA and you ,COMMA pen ,COMMA do this .PERIOD <BREAK>
And after this I wanted to build a computer out of people ,COMMA called a human-powered computer .PERIOD <BREAK>
I have behind this wall a disk drive ,COMMA a CPU ,COMMA a graphics card ,COMMA a memory system .PERIOD <BREAK>
On the computer ,COMMA when you move your mouse ,COMMA that arrow moves around .PERIOD <BREAK>
I have no staff ;SEMICOLON it's all kind of made by hand -- these sort of broken hands .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA Naomi was pivotal in that .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA if you can see here ,COMMA you know ,COMMA that program you're seeing in the corner ,COMMA if you spread it out ,COMMA it's all these things all at once .PERIOD <BREAK>
You get it ?QUESTIONMARK No ?QUESTIONMARK OK .PERIOD <BREAK>
They're littler computers ,COMMA so the one-chip computers ,COMMA I began to program one-chip computers and make objects out of PC .PERIOD boards ,COMMA LEDs .PERIOD <BREAK>
I did a show in London last year made out of iPods -- I used iPods as a material .PERIOD <BREAK>
We have this gene defect in our mind .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is from the Cape last year .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is also out there ,COMMA you know .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I went after it with passion .PERIOD <BREAK>
I was ,COMMA like ,COMMA aha ,COMMA wait a second .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA thank you everyone .PERIOD <BREAK>
What is it about flying cars ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
But we haven't yet gotten to the point where on your way here this morning you see something that really ,COMMA truly seamlessly integrates the two-dimensional world that we're comfortable in with the three-dimensional sky above us -- that ,COMMA I don't know about you ,COMMA but I really enjoy spending time in .PERIOD <BREAK>
For those of us that spend most of our lives on the ground ,COMMA this may be counter-intuitive ,COMMA but driving has potholes ,COMMA cobblestones ,COMMA pedestrians ,COMMA other drivers and a rather long and detailed list of federal motor vehicle safety standards to contend with .PERIOD <BREAK>
You just push a few buttons in the cockpit ,COMMA and the wings come out .PERIOD <BREAK>
Radio 2 :COLON That was gorgeous .PERIOD <BREAK>
The Transition will cost in line with other small airplanes .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I'm certainly not out to replace your Chevy ,COMMA but I do think that the Transition should be your next airplane .PERIOD <BREAK>
And mobility to your destination is clearly solved .PERIOD <BREAK>
The question was given to a bunch of engineers ,COMMA about 15 years ago ,COMMA How do we make the journey to Paris better ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
What you should in fact do is employ all of the world's top male and female supermodels ,COMMA pay them to walk the length of the train ,COMMA handing out free Chateau Petrus for the entire duration of the journey .PERIOD <BREAK>
They seem fantastic to me .PERIOD They cost very little to develop .PERIOD <BREAK>
Someone was actually suggesting that you can take this concept further ,COMMA and actually produce placebo education .PERIOD <BREAK>
Before long ,COMMA there was a massive underground potato-growing operation in Germany .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA boring people would have just simply banned the veil .PERIOD <BREAK>
All value is perceived value .PERIOD <BREAK>
These funny signs that flash your speed at you ,COMMA some of the new ones ,COMMA on the bottom right ,COMMA now actually show a smiley face or a frowny face ,COMMA to act as an emotional trigger .PERIOD <BREAK>
The wealthy Prussians ,COMMA to help in the war against the French ,COMMA were encouraged to give in all their jewelry .PERIOD <BREAK>
The interesting thing is that for 50 years hence ,COMMA the highest status jewelry you could wear in Prussia wasn't made of gold or diamonds .PERIOD <BREAK>
It was made of cast iron .PERIOD <BREAK>
Because actually ,COMMA never mind the actual intrinsic value of having gold jewelry .PERIOD This actually had symbolic value ,COMMA badge value .PERIOD <BREAK>
If you think about it ,COMMA Shakerism was a proto-environmental movement .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that what we add on top is kind of false .PERIOD It's a fake version .PERIOD <BREAK>
However ,COMMA what we do have now is a much more variegated media ecosystem in which to kind of create this kind of value ,COMMA and it's much fairer .PERIOD <BREAK>
Yet we've never created the opportunity for impulse saving .PERIOD <BREAK>
I would say it's a work of genius .PERIOD <BREAK>
So I just want to get your first impressions when you see that ,COMMA when you see the Diamond Shreddies box there .PERIOD <BREAK>
But it's kind of like flipping a six or a nine .PERIOD Like a six ,COMMA if you flip it over it looks like a nine .PERIOD <BREAK>
Thank you very much indeed .PERIOD <BREAK>
We're seeing the consequences all around us .PERIOD <BREAK>
I would say not just biological design ,COMMA but all of the design that we think of as human design .PERIOD <BREAK>
And 100 pages later .PERIOD <BREAK>
And another 100 pages later .PERIOD <BREAK>
Or design out of chaos ,COMMA without the aid of mind .PERIOD <BREAK>
Chaos ?QUESTIONMARK No .PERIOD What ?QUESTIONMARK Mind ?QUESTIONMARK No .PERIOD <BREAK>
But that it will get copied if it can ,COMMA regardless of the consequences .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is design process going on .PERIOD <BREAK>
A meme is not equivalent to an idea .PERIOD <BREAK>
Audience :COLON Sink ,COMMA toilet !EXCLAMATIONMARK <BREAK>
This has spread all over the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA this is a view of what humans are .PERIOD <BREAK>
And indeed ,COMMA in the short time I've already been at TED ,COMMA I see we're even closer than I thought we were before .PERIOD <BREAK>
We'll think we're choosing these things ,COMMA but the temes are making us do it .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's been very productive ,COMMA that equation .PERIOD <BREAK>
Getting a new replicator is dangerous .PERIOD <BREAK>
We may take the Gaian view .PERIOD <BREAK>
You know all about big brains .PERIOD <BREAK>
And why would they do that ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
So ,COMMA those are the two possibilities .PERIOD <BREAK>
I have no idea .PERIOD <BREAK>
I was afraid of a tsunami ;SEMICOLON what I didn't realize was there was a greater terror in Haiti ,COMMA and that was building collapse .PERIOD <BREAK>
After all ,COMMA it was the buildings ,COMMA not the earthquake ,COMMA that killed 220000 people ,COMMA that injured 330000 ,COMMA that displaced 13 million people ,COMMA that cut off food and water and supplies for an entire nation .PERIOD <BREAK>
Behind that door is the National Judicial Archives .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now there's a solution to all these problems .PERIOD <BREAK>
And because I had 70 percent of my body burned ,COMMA it would take about an hour .PERIOD <BREAK>
So originally I didn't have much money ,COMMA so I went to a hardware store and I bought a carpenter's vice .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA Ten Commandments is something that is hard to bring into the education system ,COMMA so we said ,COMMA Why don't we get people to sign the honor code ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And this is particularly interesting ,COMMA because MIT doesn't have an honor code .PERIOD <BREAK>
No bill ever disappeared .PERIOD <BREAK>
We did not pay them with dollars ;SEMICOLON we paid them with something else .PERIOD <BREAK>
But this did not solve the big problem I had with Enron yet ,COMMA because in Enron ,COMMA there's also a social element .PERIOD <BREAK>
So everybody got an envelope with all the money for the experiment ,COMMA and we told them that at the end ,COMMA we asked them to pay us back the money they didn't make .PERIOD OK ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
What would happen to the other people in the group ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Will they cheat more ,COMMA or will they cheat less ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
All of the subjects sitting in the experiment were Carnegie Mellon students .PERIOD <BREAK>
When we remind people about their morality ,COMMA they cheat less .PERIOD <BREAK>
But unless we start testing those intuitions ,COMMA we're not going to do better .PERIOD <BREAK>
Okay .PERIOD <BREAK>
Well ,COMMA cèilidh first of all is Gaelic for party ,COMMA but kitchen party in Cape Breton is very common ,COMMA and basically somebody drops into the house ,COMMA and no matter what house you go to in Cape Breton ,COMMA there's a fiddle there ,COMMA guaranteed ,COMMA and I'd say ,COMMA well there's first of all more fiddlers per capita in Cape Breton than anywhere in the world ,COMMA so ten chances to one ,COMMA the fellow who walked in the door could play it ,COMMA so you'd have someone come into the house ,COMMA you'd invite them to play a tune ,COMMA and lo and behold a little party would start up and somebody would dance ,COMMA and somebody would sing ,COMMA and all that sort of thing ,COMMA so it was a wonderful ,COMMA wonderful way to grow up ,COMMA and that is where my beginnings in music come from :COLON my surroundings ,COMMA my family ,COMMA just my bloodline in itself ,COMMA and ,COMMA oh ,COMMA I've done lots of things with my music .PERIOD <BREAK>
Donnell Leahy :COLON Thank you .PERIOD I'm kind of new to the TED experience and I'm glad to be here ,COMMA but I'm just trying to put it all together ,COMMA trying to figure all you people out ,COMMA and I've been here for a short while ,COMMA and I'm starting to understand a little bit better .PERIOD <BREAK>
We learned to play the instruments ,COMMA but we kind of had to come from within or go from within ,COMMA because we didn't watch television ,COMMA we didn't listen to a lot of radio .PERIOD We went to church and to school sometimes ,COMMA and farmed and played music ,COMMA so we were able ,COMMA I think ,COMMA at a very critical age to develop our own style ,COMMA our own self ,COMMA and my mother plays ,COMMA my father plays ,COMMA and the style that came from the Ottawa Valley in Ontario ,COMMA we call it French-Canadian style but it originated in logging camps .PERIOD <BREAK>
Airs were played in Europe at burials ,COMMA as a body was carried out from the wake site to the burial site ,COMMA the procession was led by a piper or a fiddle player .PERIOD <BREAK>
We're laughing ,COMMA like ,COMMA because our styles are totally different ,COMMA as you can hear .PERIOD <BREAK>
Announcer :COLON Great news ,COMMA they're running late downstairs .PERIOD <BREAK>
When she got up to make tea ,COMMA she placed him in my own lap and I had never felt a child that was that emaciated .PERIOD <BREAK>
Single mother ,COMMA HIV positive .PERIOD <BREAK>
I photographed her before and after the birth of her beautiful baby girl ,COMMA Issa .PERIOD <BREAK>
Joyce's mother is now taking care of her daughter ,COMMA like so many other Zimbabwean children who've been orphaned by the epidemic .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I was constantly reading the New York Times ,COMMA and stunned by the statistics ,COMMA the numbers .PERIOD <BREAK>
So I quit my job and decided that that's the subject that I wanted to tackle .PERIOD <BREAK>
We've known about fusion since 1920 ,COMMA when Sir Arthur Stanley Eddington and the British Association for the Advancement of Science conjectured that that's why the sun shines .PERIOD <BREAK>
And once it was sort of explained to me how fast we were using up the world's resources ,COMMA I got very upset ,COMMA about as upset as I did when I realized that the Earth will only last about five billion years before it's swallowed by the sun .PERIOD <BREAK>
Energy ,COMMA at the moment ,COMMA is dominated by resource .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's a medium-sized nucleus .PERIOD <BREAK>
And indeed that's exactly what stars do .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA that's that process there .PERIOD Deuterium and tritium goes together makes helium 5 .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that energy is what powers fusion .PERIOD <BREAK>
And as you go across there you see a few tens of years of oil -- the blue line ,COMMA by the way ,COMMA is the lowest estimate of existing resources .PERIOD <BREAK>
And as you go across there you will see that we've got a few tens of years ,COMMA and perhaps 100 years of fossil fuels left .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA how would we make it ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
We can do fusion .PERIOD In the center of this device we made 16 megawatts of fusion power in 1997 .PERIOD <BREAK>
If you want to know how ,COMMA ask yourself this question :COLON What would you attempt to do if you knew you could not fail ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Because when you ask it ,COMMA you begin to understand how the fear of failure constrains you ,COMMA how it keeps us from attempting great things ,COMMA and life gets dull ,COMMA amazing things stop happening .PERIOD <BREAK>
The path to truly new ,COMMA never-been-done-before things always has failure along the way .PERIOD <BREAK>
In October of 1903 ,COMMA the prevailing opinion of expert aerodynamicists was that maybe in 10 million years we could build an aircraft that would fly .PERIOD <BREAK>
40 years later ,COMMA aero experts coined the term transonic .PERIOD <BREAK>
Since we took to the sky ,COMMA we have wanted to fly faster and farther .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's boosted to near-space atop a Minotaur IV rocket .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's an unnatural act for a rocket .PERIOD <BREAK>
The third stage has a camera .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is the actual rocketcam footage from flight one .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now to conceal the shape ,COMMA we changed the aspect ratio a little bit .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is a hummingbird drone .PERIOD <BREAK>
It does not eat nectar .PERIOD <BREAK>
Or perhaps ,COMMA Spider Man will one day be Gecko Man .PERIOD <BREAK>
Each lightning bolt heats the air to 44000 degrees Fahrenheit -- hotter than the surface of the Sun .PERIOD <BREAK>
Using a grid the size of your thumb ,COMMA with 32 electrodes on the surface of his brain ,COMMA Tim uses his thoughts to control an advanced prosthetic arm .PERIOD <BREAK>
This green goo is perhaps the vaccine that could save your life .PERIOD <BREAK>
They are nerds ,COMMA and they are heroes among us .PERIOD <BREAK>
There is only time enough to iron your cape and back to the skies for you .PERIOD <BREAK>
Well I don't think we ultimately know what it will be ,COMMA right .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's actually ,COMMA Look at that cute hummingbird flying into my headquarters .PERIOD <BREAK>
Well look ,COMMA our singular mission is the creation and prevention of strategic surprise .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's what we do .PERIOD <BREAK>
And you persuade people to go to these great feats of invention ,COMMA but at a personal level ,COMMA in a way I can't imagine doing your job .PERIOD <BREAK>
But ,COMMA quite frankly ,COMMA on this issue ,COMMA there is no other road .PERIOD <BREAK>
Sorry ,COMMA this was my mother ,COMMA by the way ,COMMA in her bead shop in London .PERIOD <BREAK>
Because just that soil could make the acoustic difference .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the British government saying ,COMMA You need to be in the top five .PERIOD <BREAK>
But you just have to go to a garden center ,COMMA and they're in little paper packets .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so there was one particular toy that gave us a clue .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the government agreed to do that and not do anything else ,COMMA and focus our energy on that .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is the only project that we've done where the finished thing looked more like a rendering than our renderings .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'm sorry about my stupid voice there .PERIOD <BREAK>
So if we could chop that away and give the building a small bottom ,COMMA we could take that bit and put it at the top where the greater commercial value is for a property developer .PERIOD <BREAK>
Thank you .PERIOD <BREAK>
June Cohen :COLON So thank you .PERIOD Thank you ,COMMA Thomas .PERIOD You're a delight .PERIOD <BREAK>
Well that fundamental sense of oneness is lost on us very quickly .PERIOD <BREAK>
The self changed ,COMMA got affected ,COMMA broken ,COMMA destroyed ,COMMA but another one would evolve -- sometimes stronger ,COMMA sometimes hateful ,COMMA sometimes not wanting to be there at all .PERIOD <BREAK>
The self was not constant .PERIOD <BREAK>
But nature had its wicked way ,COMMA and brown babies were born .PERIOD <BREAK>
It was the first time that I existed inside a fully-functioning self -- one that I controlled ,COMMA that I steered ,COMMA that I gave life to .PERIOD <BREAK>
Well ,COMMA I thought I had the answer to that one ,COMMA and I said ,COMMA Skin color .PERIOD <BREAK>
For a start ,COMMA we can think about all the times when we do lose ourselves .PERIOD <BREAK>
I take it to therapy .PERIOD <BREAK>
And in that disconnected state ,COMMA yeah ,COMMA we can build factory farms with no windows ,COMMA destroy marine life and use rape as a weapon of war .PERIOD <BREAK>
Thank you for listening .PERIOD <BREAK>
You can see my fellow riders at the end of the picture ,COMMA looking at me with some concern .PERIOD <BREAK>
And here is another picture of them .PERIOD <BREAK>
They are supposed to be locked up .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I became increasingly more and more agitated ,COMMA because I was there not only to be with them ,COMMA but also to ride and create a team and I didn't know what to do .PERIOD <BREAK>
We're going downhill in some rocky terrain ,COMMA and the front tire of Alex gets caught in one of these crevasses here .PERIOD <BREAK>
I've had it .PERIOD <BREAK>
It took me several such incidents to figure out what I was supposed to do .PERIOD <BREAK>
At the beginning ,COMMA it was a disaster .PERIOD <BREAK>
I tried harsh words and threats and they took me nowhere .PERIOD <BREAK>
Go away you maniac-psychopath .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I would say ,COMMA Relax ,COMMA Alex .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA for such a kid ,COMMA when an adult that he learns to respect stays close to him and doesn't walk away from him in any situation ,COMMA irrespective of how he behaves ,COMMA it's a tremendous healing experience .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA I come from a cutthroat world of science and high technology .PERIOD <BREAK>
I used to think that reason and logic and relentless drive were the only ways to make things happen .PERIOD <BREAK>
All you have to do is play with it ,COMMA change it a little bit ,COMMA and come up with something that does help ,COMMA that does work .PERIOD <BREAK>
Or you can also look back in time and realize that you've already conquered steeper mountains before .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so we talked about these special words that we teach them .PERIOD <BREAK>
In every one of these rides I always end up standing in one of these incredible locations ,COMMA taking in this incredible landscape around me ,COMMA and I feel blessed and fortunate that I'm alive ,COMMA and that I sense every fiber in my aching body .PERIOD <BREAK>
The blank slate was an influential idea in the 20 th century .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is a recent study by the neurobiologist Paul Thompson and his colleagues in which they -- using MRI -- measured the distribution of gray matter -- that is ,COMMA the outer layer of the cortex -- in a large sample of pairs of people .PERIOD <BREAK>
And as you can see ,COMMA large amounts of the brain are not purple ,COMMA showing that if one person has a thicker bit of cortex in that region ,COMMA so does his fraternal twin .PERIOD <BREAK>
And here's what happens if you get a pair of people who share all their DNA -- namely ,COMMA clones or identical twins .PERIOD <BREAK>
Another political fear of human nature is that if we are blank slates ,COMMA we can perfect mankind -- the age-old dream of the perfectibility of our species through social engineering .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so when Thomas Jefferson wrote in the Declaration of Independence ,COMMA We hold these truths to be self-evident ,COMMA that all men are created equal ,COMMA he did not mean We hold these truths to be self-evident ,COMMA that all men are clones .PERIOD <BREAK>
That is because the human mind is a complex system with many parts ,COMMA and some of them can inhibit others .PERIOD <BREAK>
For example ,COMMA there's excellent reason to believe that virtually all humans are born with a moral sense ,COMMA and that we have cognitive abilities that allow us to profit from the lessons of history .PERIOD <BREAK>
Well ,COMMA the night is young ,COMMA but the book has been out for half a year ,COMMA and nothing terrible has happened .PERIOD <BREAK>
Visual arts -- decoration of surfaces and bodies -- appears to be a human universal .PERIOD <BREAK>
A paraphrase of a quote by Virginia Woolf ,COMMA and there's some debate as to what she actually meant by that .PERIOD <BREAK>
I mean ,COMMA this is perhaps a representative example of the visual depiction of the female form in the 15 th century ;SEMICOLON here is a representative example of the depiction of the female form in the 20 th century .PERIOD <BREAK>
Well ,COMMA this turned out to be probably the most controversial claim in the book .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the job in question was sheep rancher .PERIOD <BREAK>
This one was actually around the playing cards I got yesterday ,COMMA but it had a certain familiarity to it .PERIOD <BREAK>
Albert is the shepherd in question .PERIOD <BREAK>
Albert goes in ,COMMA I follow Albert ,COMMA the crew is around .PERIOD <BREAK>
I say ,COMMA Time out .PERIOD Stop .PERIOD <BREAK>
We don't fool around ,COMMA we don't rehearse -- we shoot what we get !EXCLAMATIONMARK <BREAK>
And I'm like ,COMMA I don't know what just happened ,COMMA but there are testicles in this bucket and that's not how we do it .PERIOD <BREAK>
He says ,COMMA OK .PERIOD <BREAK>
Gets up ,COMMA walks to the corner ,COMMA it's quivering ,COMMA and it lies down and it's in obvious distress .PERIOD <BREAK>
He's like ,COMMA A day .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I was reminded how utterly wrong I am ,COMMA so much of the time .PERIOD <BREAK>
Melanie picks up the lamb ,COMMA puts it on the post ,COMMA opens it up .PERIOD <BREAK>
I do .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I'm like ,COMMA What is this jacked-up metaphor ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Anagnorisis is the Greek word for discovery .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's peripety or peripeteia .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's crushing when the audience sees it the right way .PERIOD <BREAK>
Looking at that poor other little thing that I'd done it the right way on ,COMMA and I just was struck by if I'm wrong about that and if I'm wrong so often ,COMMA in a literal way ,COMMA what other peripatetic misconceptions might I be able to comment upon ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
I mean ,COMMA these are the people that I work with every single day .PERIOD <BREAK>
Because ,COMMA dude ,COMMA you know ,COMMA four years .PERIOD <BREAK>
You know ,COMMA follow your dreams and go broke ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Right ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
They know that other things come first -- the business of doing the work comes first ,COMMA the business of getting it done .PERIOD <BREAK>
Most hazardous environment I'd ever seen ,COMMA and I was back with a guy ,COMMA lashing the pots down .PERIOD <BREAK>
I scamper down ,COMMA I go into the wheelhouse and I say ,COMMA with some level of incredulity ,COMMA Captain ,COMMA OSHA .PERIOD <BREAK>
It goes like this -- we've declared war on work ,COMMA as a society ,COMMA all of us .PERIOD <BREAK>
We turn them into heroes ,COMMA or we turn them into punch lines .PERIOD <BREAK>
I just know that that's a front in this war .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I realized ,COMMA probably too late in this game -- I hope not ,COMMA because I don't know if I can do 200 more of these things -- but we're going to do as many as we can .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's been great talking to you and get back to work ,COMMA will you ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Democracy ,COMMA as a type of politics ,COMMA is a technology for the control and deployment of power .PERIOD <BREAK>
I would put it in the following equation :COLON no 9 / 11 ,COMMA no war .PERIOD <BREAK>
Islam represents a way of engaging the world through which one can achieve certain desirable goals .PERIOD <BREAK>
You can show the Capitol -- I had the same problem when I was designing the cover of my forthcoming book ,COMMA in fact -- what do you put on the cover to show democracy ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
You can show a mosque ,COMMA or you can show worshippers ,COMMA but there's not a straightforward way of depicting Islam .PERIOD <BREAK>
These are contested points ,COMMA and it's impossible to answer them by saying ,COMMA Ah ha ,COMMA I looked in the right place ,COMMA and I found out what these concepts mean .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I think that that's ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA probably the first appropriate response .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the hopeful response derives from recognizing that Islam and democracy are technologies .PERIOD <BREAK>
And they're making this argument wherever they're permitted to make it .PERIOD <BREAK>
They were actually blocked from even forming a party under the political system there .PERIOD Why ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Now what I want to suggest to you is that the reason for hope in this case is that we are on the edge of a real transformation in the Muslim world .PERIOD <BREAK>
When these heartbreaking images of oiled birds finally began to emerge from the Gulf of Mexico last year during the horrific BP oil spill ,COMMA a German biologist by the name of Silvia Gaus was quoted as saying ,COMMA We should just euthanize all oiled birds because studies have shown that fewer than one percent of them survive after being released .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the local seabird rescue center ,COMMA named SANCCOB ,COMMA immediately launched a massive rescue operation -- and this soon would become the largest animal rescue ever undertaken .PERIOD <BREAK>
I was a penguin aquarist at the New England Aquarium .PERIOD <BREAK>
I was instantly transported back to that moment in time .PERIOD <BREAK>
So for the few of us that were there in a professional capacity ,COMMA this extraordinary volunteer response to this animal crisis was profoundly moving and awe-inspiring .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now mind you ,COMMA three days earlier ,COMMA we had 60 penguins under our care ,COMMA so we were definitely overwhelmed and just a bit terrified -- at least I was .PERIOD <BREAK>
And you may notice they're wearing very thick gloves .PERIOD <BREAK>
He said ,COMMA Okay ,COMMA why don't we try and collect the birds at the greatest risk of getting oiled -- they collected 20000 -- and we'll ship them 500 miles up the coast to Port Elizabeth in these open air trucks and release them into the clean waters there and let them swim back home .PERIOD <BREAK>
About a year prior to this oil spill ,COMMA a 17 year-old student had invented a degreaser .PERIOD <BREAK>
Just look at that 17 year-old .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the two main threats to penguins today are overfishing and global warming .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I was doing some rather controversial religious programs .PERIOD <BREAK>
This went down very well in the UK ,COMMA where religion is extremely unpopular .PERIOD <BREAK>
Indeed ,COMMA some of the world traditions think very little of religious orthodoxy .PERIOD <BREAK>
You behave in a committed way ,COMMA and then you begin to understand the truths of religion .PERIOD <BREAK>
Why ?QUESTIONMARK Because in compassion ,COMMA when we feel with the other ,COMMA we dethrone ourselves from the center of our world and we put another person there .PERIOD And once we get rid of ego ,COMMA then we're ready to see the Divine .PERIOD <BREAK>
And in particular ,COMMA every single one of the major world traditions has highlighted -- has said -- and put at the core of their tradition what's become known as the Golden Rule .PERIOD <BREAK>
Hillel stood on one leg and said ,COMMA That which is hateful to you ,COMMA do not do to your neighbor .PERIOD That is the Torah .PERIOD The rest is commentary .PERIOD <BREAK>
So the traditions also insisted -- and this is an important point ,COMMA I think -- that you could not and must not confine your compassion to your own group :COLON your own nation ,COMMA your own co-religionists ,COMMA your own fellow countrymen .PERIOD You must have what one of the Chinese sages called jian ai :COLON concern for everybody .PERIOD Love your enemies .PERIOD Honor the stranger .PERIOD <BREAK>
And this ,COMMA again -- this universal outreach -- is getting subdued in the strident use of religion -- abuse of religion -- for nefarious gains .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA I've lost count of the number of taxi drivers who ,COMMA when I say to them what I do for a living ,COMMA inform me that religion has been the cause of all the major world wars in history .PERIOD Wrong .PERIOD <BREAK>
Because it seems to me that with -- our current situation is so serious at the moment that any ideology that doesn't promote a sense of global understanding and global appreciation of each other is failing the test of the time .PERIOD <BREAK>
I was part of that United Nations initiative called the Alliance of Civilizations ,COMMA which was asked by Kofi Annan to diagnose the causes of extremism ,COMMA and to give practical guidelines to member states about how to avoid the escalation of further extremism .PERIOD <BREAK>
It was just one of those pot-luck things where you get it right first time .PERIOD <BREAK>
Moving on to something a bit larger ,COMMA this is an X-ray of a bus .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's not just Topshop ,COMMA I get some strange looks when I go out getting my props .PERIOD <BREAK>
And to carry on with a theme that we've already touched with is how nature is related to architecture .PERIOD <BREAK>
In fact ,COMMA that is three months solid X-raying .PERIOD <BREAK>
And when they do ,COMMA I'm in the queue .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA I like to use them .PERIOD <BREAK>
That flower doesn't come in bright orange ,COMMA I don't think .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'm now going to show you a short film ,COMMA I'll step to the side .PERIOD <BREAK>
The bus was done with a cargo-scanning X-ray machine ,COMMA which is used on the borders between countries ,COMMA looking for contraband and illegal immigrants .PERIOD <BREAK>
I will show how the capillary action works ,COMMA how it feeds ,COMMA I'll be able to get all the cells inside that stem .PERIOD <BREAK>
Sometimes you keep the time up ,COMMA because the time gives you detail .PERIOD <BREAK>
The longer the exposure goes on for ,COMMA the more detail you get .PERIOD <BREAK>
I've got the opportunity now to show you what I'm going to be doing in the future .PERIOD <BREAK>
Like ,COMMA my first computer was a big movement in my life .PERIOD <BREAK>
Meet Tony .PERIOD He's my student .PERIOD <BREAK>
If I ever get out of here ,COMMA there will always be a mark by my name .PERIOD <BREAK>

Then can you tell me what wrong is ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Socrates died in prison ,COMMA his philosophy intact .PERIOD <BREAK>
His body is in prison ,COMMA but his mind is free .PERIOD <BREAK>
Yes ,COMMA they gave 12 monkeys a typewriter for a week ,COMMA and after a week ,COMMA they only used it as a bathroom .PERIOD <BREAK>
You'll been engulfed by a red giant .PERIOD <BREAK>
Love does not die because of that thing .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'm very lucky ,COMMA because he's better than all the other children .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's the wonderful thing about evolution -- the predilection to believe that our child is best .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now in many ways ,COMMA that's just a survival thing .PERIOD <BREAK>
The fact we see here is the vehicle for our genes ,COMMA and therefore we love it .PERIOD <BREAK>
But we don't notice that bit ;SEMICOLON we just unconditionally love .PERIOD <BREAK>
Perhaps you've been at home for a week on your own .PERIOD <BREAK>
You house is in a terrible state .PERIOD <BREAK>
You think ,COMMA what should I do ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
For me ,COMMA it's a very ,COMMA very important thing .PERIOD <BREAK>
I look out the window ,COMMA and I realize that every single time we stop and I look out that window ,COMMA framed in that window ,COMMA wherever we are ,COMMA I am observing more life than there is in the rest of the known universe beyond the planet Earth .PERIOD <BREAK>
That ,COMMA to me ,COMMA is an incredible thing .PERIOD <BREAK>
I began The Vagina Monologues because I was worried about vaginas .PERIOD <BREAK>
What does anyone mean when they talk about real security ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
This is ,COMMA of course ,COMMA unless your whole life is about being secure .PERIOD <BREAK>
You become whatever it is that will freeze you ,COMMA numb you and protect you from doubt or change .PERIOD <BREAK>
But all this does ,COMMA actually ,COMMA is shut down your mind .PERIOD <BREAK>
One of the amazing things that I've discovered in my travels is that there is this emerging species .PERIOD <BREAK>
I've discovered these people ,COMMA who ,COMMA in V-Day world ,COMMA we call Vagina Warriors .PERIOD <BREAK>
They raised 10000 dollars on a production that never occurred .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now this seems like a fairly ,COMMA you know ,COMMA frivolous ,COMMA but what happened as a result of that ,COMMA is that that school now is forming a sex education class .PERIOD It's beginning to talk about sex ,COMMA it's beginning to look at why it would be wrong for a young high school girl to talk about her vagina publicly or to say that she loved her vagina publicly .PERIOD <BREAK>
In the years that she walked ,COMMA she educated parents ,COMMA mothers ,COMMA fathers .PERIOD <BREAK>
Real security is contemplating death ,COMMA not pretending it doesn't exist .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I think part of what I'm learning in this process is that one must allow oneself to feel grief .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now I was stupid ,COMMA but not so stupid that I turned it down .PERIOD <BREAK>
It is the story factory ,COMMA one of the very best in the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
But they all have one thing in common :COLON They all need to look like something .PERIOD <BREAK>
They all need a face .PERIOD <BREAK>
The first was Katharine Hepburn's memoirs ,COMMA and the second was a biography of Marlene Dietrich .PERIOD <BREAK>
So the Hepburn story is words and the Dietrich story is pictures ,COMMA and so we did this .PERIOD <BREAK>
And what I ended up with was a graphic representation of us seeing this animal coming into being .PERIOD <BREAK>
No ,COMMA that is not me .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's a responsibility .PERIOD <BREAK>
A book cover is a distillation .PERIOD <BREAK>
This story was a real puzzle .PERIOD <BREAK>
Huhh !EXCLAMATIONMARK And now the sultan is in danger .PERIOD <BREAK>
Don't get me started .PERIOD <BREAK>
But something is definitely lost :COLON tradition ,COMMA a sensual experience ,COMMA the comfort of thingy-ness -- a little bit of humanity .PERIOD <BREAK>
What does it look like ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Yes .PERIOD It can ,COMMA it does and it will ,COMMA but for this book designer ,COMMA page-turner ,COMMA dog-eared place-holder ,COMMA notes in the margins-taker ,COMMA ink-sniffer ,COMMA the story looks like this .PERIOD <BREAK>
The students should teach their teachers .PERIOD <BREAK>
Well ,COMMA we heard that one too ,COMMA but Pioneer Germ Fighters totally rules .PERIOD <BREAK>
Instead of just scoffing at this heresy that a kid wanted to get published or saying wait until you're older ,COMMA my parents were really supportive .PERIOD <BREAK>
The school I went to was pretty boring .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that was the finishing post right there .PERIOD <BREAK>
But our school at that time got a grant from the government ,COMMA and they got an incredible computer -- the research machine 3 DZ -- and they left the programming manuals lying around .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's what they thought they had built it for .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is one of my favorite ones here ,COMMA where they have rabbit breeding ,COMMA so males choose the lucky rabbit .PERIOD <BREAK>
So I went on for the next 20 years or so making a lot of different games .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA Chris did ask me to bring some statistics with me ,COMMA so I've done that .PERIOD <BREAK>
But 83 percent of games don't have any mature content whatsoever ,COMMA so it's just not true .PERIOD <BREAK>
It makes about 80 million bucks a month in subscriptions .PERIOD <BREAK>
I wanted to update that video and give you a new look at it .PERIOD <BREAK>
I played in the backyard ,COMMA learned to read ,COMMA and even ate some of my vegetables .PERIOD <BREAK>
But as was the case for most of my generation ,COMMA I spent a lot of time in front of the TV .PERIOD <BREAK>
Their importance blends into the sensationalized drama of prime time TV .PERIOD <BREAK>
I have fought in wars ,COMMA feared for my own survival ,COMMA watched my cohorts die on beaches and woods that look and feel more real than any textbook or any news story .PERIOD <BREAK>
As gamers we are now living by the same laws of physics in the same cities and doing many of the same things we once did in real life ,COMMA only virtually .PERIOD <BREAK>
The sensory cues are very similar .PERIOD <BREAK>

So one of the things that goes from simple to complex is when we do more .PERIOD We like more .PERIOD <BREAK>
And in fact ,COMMA what Murray was talking about yesterday in the fractal beauty of nature -- of having the descriptions at various levels be rather similar -- all goes down to the idea that the elementary particles are both sticky and standoffish ,COMMA and they're in violent motion .PERIOD <BREAK>
Not because it wasn't beautiful or anything ,COMMA but because it misses the thing that most students fail to understand about molecular biology ,COMMA and that is :COLON why is there any probability at all of two complex shapes finding each other just the right way so they combine together and be catalyzed ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
So they had created these artifacts .PERIOD <BREAK>

We're reading the book of life .PERIOD <BREAK>
On the way there it's going to completely revolutionize medicine and health care ;SEMICOLON that's obvious .PERIOD <BREAK>
What we're doing is we are seizing control of our evolutionary future .PERIOD <BREAK>
That is going to be the IT challenge of the next generation ,COMMA is communicating all this information .PERIOD <BREAK>
We're sort of circumventing evolutionary programs that guide our behavior .PERIOD <BREAK>
It didn't happen .PERIOD <BREAK>
And pretty soon it's going to be possible to avoid virtually all genetic diseases in that way .PERIOD <BREAK>
Directly going in -- it's a little bit further away ,COMMA but not that far away -- going in and altering the genes in the first cell in an embryo .PERIOD <BREAK>

So this was a great project .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA I want to start out with this beautiful picture from my childhood .PERIOD <BREAK>
If you go back two billion years ,COMMA you're not on an Earth-like planet any more .PERIOD <BREAK>
What we call an Earth-like planet is actually a very short interval of time .PERIOD <BREAK>
We are right now in the beautiful Oreo of existence -- of at least life on Planet Earth -- following the first horrible microbial age .PERIOD <BREAK>
We have as much time for animals to exist on this planet as they have been here now ,COMMA till we hit the second microbial age .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that's the fate of a planet ,COMMA too .PERIOD <BREAK>
All along it was thought to be either an act of God or perhaps long ,COMMA slow climate change ,COMMA and that really changed in 1980 ,COMMA in this rocky outcrop near Gubbio ,COMMA where Walter Alvarez ,COMMA trying to figure out what was the time difference between these white rocks ,COMMA which held creatures of the Cretaceous period ,COMMA and the pink rocks above ,COMMA which held Tertiary fossils .PERIOD <BREAK>
A 10 -kilometer body hit the planet .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is a Gorgonopsian ,COMMA or a Gorgon .PERIOD <BREAK>

And the last three years have seen an enormous breakthrough in a brand-new field .PERIOD <BREAK>
We had these hydrogen sulfide oceans for a very great long period .PERIOD <BREAK>

But right now ,COMMA most of the companies involved in these supply chains don't have any way of assuring us that nobody had to mortgage their future ,COMMA nobody had to sacrifice their rights to bring us our favorite brand name product .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA I didn't come here to depress you about the state of the global supply chain .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's a pharmaceutical product .PERIOD <BREAK>
You expect that the supply chain that gets it to the hospital ,COMMA probably squeaky clean .PERIOD <BREAK>
So a couple of years ago ,COMMA we had a scandal which killed about 80 people around the world ,COMMA because of contaminants that crept into the heparin supply chain .PERIOD <BREAK>

But in Hiroshima ,COMMA some people were wiped clean away ,COMMA leaving only a wristwatch or a diary page .PERIOD <BREAK>
In the original story ,COMMA God told Sarah she could do something impossible and she laughed ,COMMA because the first Sarah ,COMMA she didn't know what to do with impossible .PERIOD <BREAK>
But on the front step ,COMMA a person who was sitting there blocked the rays from hitting the stone .PERIOD <BREAK>
They not only recorded history ;SEMICOLON they helped change the course of history .PERIOD <BREAK>
And as a reaction ,COMMA it stimulates public opinion and gives impetus to public debate ,COMMA thereby preventing the interested parties from totally controlling the agenda ,COMMA much as they would like to .PERIOD <BREAK>
That was a tradition I wanted to follow .PERIOD <BREAK>
Seeing the war created such incredibly high stakes for everyone involved and that visual journalism could actually become a factor in conflict resolution -- I wanted to be a photographer in order to be a war photographer .PERIOD <BREAK>
In 1981 ,COMMA I went to Northern Ireland .PERIOD <BREAK>

For the first time in years ,COMMA Shi'ites were allowed to make the pilgrimage to Karbala to observe Ashura ,COMMA and I was amazed by the sheer number of people and how fervently they practiced their religion .PERIOD <BREAK>
The spirit they displayed was absolutely remarkable .PERIOD <BREAK>
Photographers go to the extreme edges of human experience to show people what's going on .PERIOD <BREAK>

So what will happen now is quite straightforward .PERIOD <BREAK>
Most of us have to trust that that happens correctly for our own vote ,COMMA and we all have to trust that that happens correctly for all the votes in the election .PERIOD <BREAK>
So this is how you vote .PERIOD <BREAK>
So you let a poll station worker scan your encrypted vote .PERIOD <BREAK>
And these are elections by the people ,COMMA for the people .PERIOD <BREAK>
I was in India this past year ,COMMA and I may have seen the last cases of polio in the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
And he made an outrageous prediction that smallpox would be eradicated ,COMMA and that this was God's gift to humanity because of the hard work of dedicated scientists .PERIOD <BREAK>
Audience :COLON Early detection ,COMMA early response .PERIOD <BREAK>
And India was the place where smallpox made its last stand .PERIOD <BREAK>
You could vaccinate everybody in India ,COMMA but one year later there'll be 21 million new babies ,COMMA which was then the population of Canada .PERIOD <BREAK>
We had a scorecard that we wrote on every house .PERIOD <BREAK>

They reported this to WHO .PERIOD WHO took a little while taking action because WHO will only receive a report from a government ,COMMA because it's the United Nations .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA what's really important is that ,COMMA before there was GPHIN ,COMMA 100 percent of all the world's reports of bad things -- whether you're talking about famine or you're talking about bird flu or you're talking about Ebola -- 100 percent of all those reports came from nations .PERIOD <BREAK>

Now ,COMMA here's what's real interesting ,COMMA after they'd been working for a couple years ,COMMA what do you think happened to those nations ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
I was this weird little kid who wanted to have deep talks about the worlds that might exist beyond the ones that we perceive with our senses .PERIOD <BREAK>
Take a breath right now of this clear air in this room .PERIOD <BREAK>
They've made me a proud I-don't-know-it-all .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we used some guidelines to keep our conversation elevated ,COMMA and you can use them too ,COMMA because I know you're all going to take an Other to lunch .PERIOD <BREAK>
My lunch partner and I came away with some really important insights ,COMMA and I'm going to share just one with you .PERIOD <BREAK>
And since we had established some trust ,COMMA we believed in each other's sincerity .PERIOD <BREAK>
We agreed we'd speak up in our own communities when we witnessed the kind of otherizing talk that can wound and fester into paranoia and then be used by those on the fringes to incite .PERIOD <BREAK>
Instead ,COMMA we had taken first steps together ,COMMA past our knee-jerk reactions ,COMMA to the ubuntu place ,COMMA which is the only place where solutions to our most intractable-seeming problems will be found .PERIOD <BREAK>
Because ubuntu work is slow ,COMMA and it's difficult .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's two people ,COMMA two warriors ,COMMA dropping their weapons and reaching toward each other .PERIOD <BREAK>
In my life ,COMMA when I tried to achieve things like success or recognition ,COMMA they eluded me .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it is ,COMMA for me ,COMMA a language which expressed the intangible ,COMMA and gives voice to people and stories without .PERIOD <BREAK>
Joshua claims to have personally killed more than 10000 people during Liberia's civil war .PERIOD <BREAK>
But what I saw opened my eyes to an idea of forgiveness which I never thought possible .PERIOD <BREAK>

And yes ,COMMA all of those people killed were male .PERIOD <BREAK>
Many of the women are married with children ,COMMA and they say the hardest part of their deployment was being kept away from their children .PERIOD <BREAK>
And when I asked one of the women about the shock and awe response ,COMMA she said ,COMMA Don't worry ,COMMA same thing back home .PERIOD <BREAK>
We know how to deal with these fellows ,COMMA and ignored them .PERIOD <BREAK>
Sometimes ,COMMA when the war is over and all the film crews have left ,COMMA the most inspiring stories are the ones that float just beneath the radar .PERIOD <BREAK>
They answer more than 5000 calls in just two months .PERIOD <BREAK>
It seems that this story helped change perceptions about the DFS ,COMMA at least in the minds of an audience in part on televisions ,COMMA read magazines and whose huts aren't on fire .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's right ,COMMA yeah .PERIOD Very rarely do we ever know ,COMMA and if we find out at some stage then we destroy that information as soon as possible .PERIOD <BREAK>
Wow ,COMMA so your leak really substantially changed the world ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Let me know when you've got them .PERIOD Let's shoot .PERIOD <BREAK>
Hotel .PERIOD Bushmaster Two-Six ,COMMA Bushmaster Two-Six ,COMMA we need to move ,COMMA time now !EXCLAMATIONMARK <BREAK>

What was the key element of this that actually caused the outrage ,COMMA do you think ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
I mean ,COMMA in general ,COMMA what's your philosophy ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
We have a way of dealing with information that has sort of personal -- personally identifying information in it .PERIOD <BREAK>
Yeah ,COMMA we do get a lot of that .PERIOD <BREAK>
But do you see any irony in the fact that ,COMMA in order for you to shine that light ,COMMA you have to ,COMMA yourself ,COMMA create secrecy around your sources ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
You know ,COMMA there might be a couple of views of WikiLeaks and of Julian .PERIOD <BREAK>
So late last year -- in November last year -- there was a series of well blowouts in Albania ,COMMA like the well blowout in the Gulf of Mexico ,COMMA but not quite as big .PERIOD <BREAK>
So under that basis ,COMMA we put it out and said ,COMMA Look ,COMMA we're skeptical about this thing .PERIOD <BREAK>
I mean ,COMMA we're an organization that is hard to grow very quickly because of the sort of material we deal with ,COMMA so we have to restructure in order to have people who will deal with the highest national security stuff ,COMMA and then lower security cases .PERIOD <BREAK>
Can that be right ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And you were also -- I mean ,COMMA you were also a hacker at an early age and ran into the authorities early on .PERIOD <BREAK>
So this phrase is not ,COMMA not as nice as it used to be .PERIOD <BREAK>
So just tell us ,COMMA very quickly in the last minute ,COMMA the story :COLON what happened in Iceland ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Instead ,COMMA they publicized your side .PERIOD <BREAK>
However ,COMMA no studies exist yet that show how or why .PERIOD <BREAK>
But then one night ,COMMA my mom was cooking grilled chicken for dinner ,COMMA and I noticed that the edges of the chicken ,COMMA which had been marinated in lemon juice ,COMMA turned white .PERIOD <BREAK>
And later in biology class ,COMMA I learned that it's due to a process called denaturing ,COMMA which is where the proteins will change shape and lose their ability to chemically function .PERIOD <BREAK>
I was the 17 - 18 year-old age category winner and then the grand prize winner .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that was my first science fair project .PERIOD <BREAK>
My parents suffered through many more of my science fair projects ,COMMA including a remote controlled garbage can .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that's huge .PERIOD <BREAK>
So that was my work ,COMMA and it was my way of reimagining the future for future research ,COMMA with figuring out exactly what this protein does ,COMMA but also for the future of chemotherapy effectiveness -- so maybe all grandfathers with cancer have a little bit more time to spend with their grandchildren .PERIOD <BREAK>
But soon after ,COMMA I developed a novel mathematical model that essentially quantifies the effect of these environmental pollutants on the lung health of asthmatic patients .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it surprises me that no model currently exists that quantifies the effect of environmental factors on human lung health ,COMMA because that relationship seems so important .PERIOD <BREAK>
Because I realized that if we could find a way to target remediation ,COMMA we could also find a way to treat asthmatic patients more effectively .PERIOD <BREAK>
These chemical pollutants are currently not a criteria air pollutant ,COMMA as defined by the US .PERIOD Clean Air Act .PERIOD <BREAK>
So any user can come in here and click on lung function report and it'll take them to this report that I created .PERIOD <BREAK>
My translation medium is a very simple basket .PERIOD <BREAK>
That means that it is the numbers that control the form ,COMMA not me .PERIOD <BREAK>
I use these scores to collaborate with musicians .PERIOD <BREAK>
This piece here is read very differently depending on where you place it .PERIOD <BREAK>
You place it in a science museum ,COMMA it becomes a three-dimensional visualization of data .PERIOD <BREAK>
So after being interrogated by this Japanese manager for a half an hour ,COMMA he finally said ,COMMA So ,COMMA Miss Yang ,COMMA do you have any questions to ask me ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And sometimes I have young people approaching me say ,COMMA Lan ,COMMA you changed my life ,COMMA and I feel proud of that .PERIOD <BREAK>
So it means young couples will have to support four parents who have a life expectancy of 73 years old .PERIOD <BREAK>
So making a living is not that easy for young people .PERIOD <BREAK>
And for those who are ready to get married and buy their apartment ,COMMA they figured out they have to work for 30 to 40 years to afford their first apartment .PERIOD <BREAK>
For those who do return back to the countryside ,COMMA they find themselves very welcome locally ,COMMA because with the knowledge ,COMMA skills and networks they have learned in the cities ,COMMA with the assistance of the Internet ,COMMA they're able to create more jobs ,COMMA upgrade local agriculture and create new business in the less developed market .PERIOD <BREAK>
And after hours of negotiation ,COMMA 500 dogs were rescued .PERIOD <BREAK>
And here also people are helping to find missing children .PERIOD <BREAK>
I guess these are the questions people are going to answer .PERIOD <BREAK>
And our younger generation are going to transform this country while at the same time being transformed themselves .PERIOD <BREAK>
They only learn to be frightened of those differences when an adult influences them to behave that way ,COMMA and maybe censors that natural curiosity ,COMMA or you know ,COMMA reins in the question-asking in the hopes of them being polite little kids .PERIOD <BREAK>
The doors open ,COMMA the kids descend on this table of legs ,COMMA and they are poking and prodding ,COMMA and they're wiggling toes ,COMMA and they're trying to put their full weight on the sprinting leg to see what happens with that .PERIOD <BREAK>

And you can do strange things with this stuff .PERIOD This is a baby gar .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA the last of these things died in September 1936 .PERIOD <BREAK>
And if we do that ,COMMA and insert this into a fertilized wolf's egg ,COMMA we may give birth to an animal that hasn't walked the earth since 1936 .PERIOD <BREAK>
The really neat thing about this stuff is that's life .PERIOD <BREAK>
And in the measure that we learn how chickens grow wings ,COMMA and what the program is for those cells to differentiate ,COMMA one of the things we're going to be able to do is to stop undifferentiated cells ,COMMA which you know as cancer ,COMMA and one of the things we're going to learn how to do is how to reprogram cells like stem cells in such a way that they express bone ,COMMA stomach ,COMMA skin ,COMMA pancreas .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's why sometimes a person's genes don't have to change a lot to get cancer .PERIOD <BREAK>
Same thing with Receptin if you've got breast cancer .PERIOD <BREAK>
And you can watch states rise and fall depending on their ability to speak a language of life ,COMMA and you can watch New York fall off a cliff ,COMMA and you can watch New Jersey fall off a cliff ,COMMA and you can watch the rise of the new empires of intelligence .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's why nations rise and fall .PERIOD <BREAK>
In the 1990 s ,COMMA these are sovereign states that did not exist before 1990 .PERIOD <BREAK>

Also the person sitting in your very seats is a liar .PERIOD <BREAK>
I watch that TV show 'Lie To Me' I know you're lying .PERIOD <BREAK>
They use it to get to the truth ,COMMA and they do what mature leaders do everyday ;SEMICOLON they have difficult conversations with difficult people ,COMMA sometimes during very difficult times .PERIOD <BREAK>
Its power emerges when someone else agrees to believe the lie .PERIOD <BREAK>
Deception is actually serious business .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's woven into the fabric of our daily and our business lives .PERIOD <BREAK>
Koko was taught to communicate via sign language .PERIOD <BREAK>

Now the technology around what the truth looks like is progressing on ,COMMA the science of it .PERIOD <BREAK>
I do now ,COMMA after learning about all the quantum stuff .PERIOD <BREAK>
They fight ,COMMA they get back up ,COMMA you know ?QUESTIONMARK Wouldn't this be cool ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
This is a clay maker .PERIOD <BREAK>
You know ,COMMA how -- why would a kid want a dinosaur ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
You can see how old this stuff is .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I'm really not very good at it .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is a -- you can see the little window there .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA this is a quick tale I'm going to tell .PERIOD This is the Furby tale .PERIOD <BREAK>
So this is my family .PERIOD <BREAK>
I try to do a lot of philosophy ,COMMA a lot of thinking about all of these projects .PERIOD <BREAK>
You can see the little BB in the box is my tilt sensor .PERIOD <BREAK>
I just basically gnawed all this stuff out of plastic .PERIOD <BREAK>
He didn't test so well ,COMMA but I like him .PERIOD <BREAK>
And then she started doing these other images .PERIOD <BREAK>
I have three girls and they just ,COMMA they -- it's like a rescue animal thing they're going there .PERIOD <BREAK>
And on the weekend we ran the parts for that .PERIOD <BREAK>
So this is how they come out close to the end .PERIOD <BREAK>
For a while ,COMMA they were making two million Furbys a month .PERIOD <BREAK>
And she still actually has those .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we're going to try to really pull this off ,COMMA intentfully try to make something that seems like it's alive .PERIOD <BREAK>
And you could actually find full fossil evidence of these .PERIOD <BREAK>
Very ,COMMA very obsessive .PERIOD <BREAK>
And then more sculpting ,COMMA and then more sculpting ,COMMA and then more sculpting ,COMMA and then more sculpting .PERIOD <BREAK>
John ,COMMA do you want to bring him up ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Yeah ,COMMA they're like kids ,COMMA you know .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's what the investors think ,COMMA that it's just -- -- right ,COMMA right .PERIOD So they're really sweet little guys .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now these are not robots ,COMMA they're kind of lovebots ,COMMA you know .PERIOD <BREAK>
We -- actually ,COMMA it's very hard to keep people from doing this .PERIOD <BREAK>
And there's a lot of social responsibility in that .PERIOD <BREAK>
If they can do that ,COMMA why can't governments and NGOs do the same thing ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
So that's why I took a bit of time to study Coke .PERIOD <BREAK>
They have this very continuous feedback loop .PERIOD <BREAK>
They said ,COMMA You roll the ball ,COMMA you hear some pins go down .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's dark ,COMMA you can't see which one goes down until the lights come on ,COMMA and then you an see your impact .PERIOD <BREAK>
Real-time data turns on the lights .PERIOD <BREAK>
They set them up as what they called micro-distribution centers ,COMMA and those local entrepreneurs then hire sales people ,COMMA who go out with bicycles and pushcarts and wheelbarrows to sell the product .PERIOD <BREAK>
The government noticed in Ethiopia that many of the people were so far away from a health clinic ,COMMA they were over a day's travel away from a health clinic .PERIOD <BREAK>
The third component of Coke's success is marketing .PERIOD <BREAK>
Let's listen to this song that Coke created for it ,COMMA Wavin' Flag by a Somali hip hop artist .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it went number one on the pop chart in 17 countries .PERIOD <BREAK>
I've even seen it used for a chicken coop .PERIOD <BREAK>
We know that circumcision reduces HIV infection by 60 percent in men .PERIOD <BREAK>
But it turns out the men do ,COMMA because they're hearing from their girlfriends that they prefer it ,COMMA and the men also believe it improves their sex life .PERIOD <BREAK>
So what's the endgame ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
So if Coke's marketers came to me and asked me to define happiness ,COMMA I'd say my vision of happiness is a mother holding healthy baby in her arms .PERIOD <BREAK>
To me ,COMMA that is deep happiness .PERIOD <BREAK>
Thank you .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is my baseline :COLON This is the Mediterranean coast with no fish ,COMMA bare rock and lots of sea urchins that like to eat the algae .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is their baseline .PERIOD This is what they think is natural because we started modern science with scuba diving long after we started degrading marine ecosystems .PERIOD <BREAK>
What have we learned from these places ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
When we went to pristine reefs ,COMMA we realized that the natural world was upside down ;SEMICOLON this pyramid was inverted .PERIOD <BREAK>
The top head does account for most of the biomass ,COMMA in some places up to 85 percent ,COMMA like Kingman Reef ,COMMA which is now protected .PERIOD <BREAK>
Then you go to Palmyra Atoll that has more biomass of herbivores ,COMMA and the dead corals are clean ,COMMA and the corals are coming back .PERIOD <BREAK>
And this is what I saw ,COMMA lots of fish .PERIOD <BREAK>
And this particular place ,COMMA the Medes Islands Marine Reserve ,COMMA is only 94 hectares ,COMMA and it brings 6 million euros to the local economy ,COMMA 20 times more than fishing ,COMMA and it represents 88 percent of all the tourist revenue .PERIOD <BREAK>
These places ,COMMA when we protect them ,COMMA if we compare them to unprotected areas nearby ,COMMA this is what happens .PERIOD <BREAK>
The abundance ,COMMA how many fish you have per square meter ,COMMA increases almost 170 percent .PERIOD <BREAK>
If you fish less ,COMMA you're actually catching more .PERIOD <BREAK>
Another example :COLON Nassau groupers in Belize in the Mesoamerican Reef .PERIOD <BREAK>
When I went there for the first time in 2000 ,COMMA there were only 3000 groupers left .PERIOD <BREAK>
It happened in many places around the Caribbean .PERIOD <BREAK>
So how much of this do we have ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
People are losing their jobs because the fisheries are collapsing .PERIOD <BREAK>
The problem is that we can create these large reserves only in places where there are no people ,COMMA where there is no social conflict ,COMMA where the political cost is really low and the economic cost is also low .PERIOD <BREAK>
But what about the rest of the coast of the world ,COMMA where people live and make a living out of fishing ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
How could 85 percent survive on 15 percent ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
The animals at the lower parts of the food chain ,COMMA they reproduce very fast ;SEMICOLON they grow really fast ;SEMICOLON they produce millions of eggs .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA really ,COMMA our picture of a food pyramid is just -- we have to change that completely .PERIOD <BREAK>
We think this is universal .PERIOD <BREAK>
So the numbers you presented really are astonishing .PERIOD <BREAK>
Talk to me about the feeling that you must have experienced of going to these pristine areas and seeing things coming back .PERIOD <BREAK>
And if it were not for these places that show hope ,COMMA I don't think I could continue doing this job .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the problem ,COMMA I think ,COMMA is that we take the ocean for granted .PERIOD <BREAK>
Most of the animals are in the oceans .PERIOD <BREAK>
We use the submarine Alvin and we use cameras ,COMMA and the cameras are something that Bill Lange has developed with the help of Sony .PERIOD <BREAK>
Marcel Proust said ,COMMA The true voyage of discovery is not so much in seeking new landscapes as in having new eyes .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's got tentacles dangling ,COMMA swirling around like that .PERIOD <BREAK>
And these are the types of animals that live in that three-dimensional space ,COMMA that micro-gravity environment that we really haven't explored .PERIOD <BREAK>
They're very little understood .PERIOD <BREAK>
They go from a couple of inches to a couple of feet .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's footage that we've collected for scientific purposes .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we're over the Atlantic -- that's the ridge right there -- but we're going to go across the Caribbean ,COMMA Central America ,COMMA and end up against the Pacific ,COMMA nine degrees north .PERIOD <BREAK>
Here's where Bill's cameras really do shine .PERIOD <BREAK>
And what you're seeing here is a cloud of densely packed ,COMMA hydrogen-sulfide-rich water coming out of a volcanic axis on the sea floor .PERIOD <BREAK>
Not only is it coming out of the Earth -- so ,COMMA biogenesis made from volcanic activity -- but that bacteria supports these colonies of life .PERIOD <BREAK>
A mile and a half from the surface to two miles to three miles -- no sun has ever gotten down here .PERIOD <BREAK>
Oh !EXCLAMATIONMARK Good going .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is a female of this kind of worm .PERIOD <BREAK>
You watch .PERIOD It doesn't take long before two guys here -- this one and one that will show up over here -- start to fight .PERIOD <BREAK>
The red dot is the laser light of the submarine Alvin to give us an idea about how far away we are from the vents .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's actually a light-sensing organ .PERIOD <BREAK>
This one's several stories tall .PERIOD <BREAK>
This stuff is toxic as hell ,COMMA by the way .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's probably where we evolved from .PERIOD <BREAK>
There's a fish sitting here .PERIOD <BREAK>
Here's a crab with his claw right at the end of that tube worm ,COMMA waiting for that worm to stick his head out .PERIOD <BREAK>
The worms are growing inches per week !EXCLAMATIONMARK <BREAK>
Despite that ,COMMA these animals grow back in about a year's time .PERIOD <BREAK>
Learn to manage it .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA I'd like to talk about why that is ,COMMA why that's such a calamity for society ,COMMA what we can do about it and ,COMMA to close with ,COMMA why this is an amazing time to be a math teacher .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is really destructive .PERIOD <BREAK>
David Milch ,COMMA creator of Deadwood and other amazing TV shows ,COMMA has a really good description for this .PERIOD <BREAK>
You expect sitcom-sized problems that wrap up in 22 minutes ,COMMA three commercial breaks and a laugh track .PERIOD <BREAK>
In all seriousness .PERIOD Here's an example from a physics textbook .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'm sure we all agree that no problem worth solving is like that .PERIOD <BREAK>
So I can diagnose the problem a little more specifically in math .PERIOD <BREAK>
The math serves the conversation ,COMMA the conversation doesn't serve the math .PERIOD <BREAK>
I like this question .PERIOD It's about a water tank .PERIOD <BREAK>
I've got kids who are mathematically and conversationally intimidated joining the conversation .PERIOD <BREAK>
We need more patient problem solvers .PERIOD Thank you .PERIOD <BREAK>
Because actually radical innovation does sometimes come from the very best ,COMMA but it often comes from places where you have huge need -- unmet ,COMMA latent demand -- and not enough resources for traditional solutions to work -- traditional ,COMMA high-cost solutions ,COMMA which depend on professionals ,COMMA which is what schools and hospitals are .PERIOD <BREAK>
We'll grow by six cities of 12 million people a year for the next 30 years .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is where you'll find the fastest growing young populations of the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
Or you can go to places like this .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is Kibera ,COMMA which is the largest slum in East Africa .PERIOD <BREAK>
Millions of people living here ,COMMA stretched over many kilometers .PERIOD <BREAK>
They're private schools .PERIOD There are no state schools in slums .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's not to do with electricity or water .PERIOD <BREAK>
If you want to design from scratch virtually any service in Africa ,COMMA you would start now with the mobile phone .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is a place called the Madangiri Settlement Colony ,COMMA which is a very developed slum about 25 minutes outside New Delhi ,COMMA where I met these characters who showed me around for the day .PERIOD <BREAK>
Ten years ago ,COMMA they certainly would have been married .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is the best you can get in Hyderabad in Indian education .PERIOD <BREAK>
But they find it completely obvious to use computers ,COMMA websites ,COMMA make videos ,COMMA so on and so forth .PERIOD <BREAK>
One is to deliver extrinsic motivation ,COMMA that education has a payoff .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's too long if you're poor .PERIOD <BREAK>
So you need education to be relevant and help people to make a living there and then ,COMMA often .PERIOD <BREAK>
Our education systems ,COMMA you do all that stuff afterward ,COMMA if you're lucky ,COMMA sport ,COMMA drama ,COMMA music .PERIOD <BREAK>
So El Sistema in Venezuela uses a violin as a technology of learning .PERIOD <BREAK>
Taio Rocha uses making soap as a technology of learning .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I learned it from this guy ,COMMA who is an amazing character .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it also supports working-class kids going into Indian schools .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it's the same wherever you go .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's reliable and people know exactly where they are .PERIOD <BREAK>
Why can't we do it more like the Chinese restaurants ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
There are Big Picture schools in the US .PERIOD and Australia .PERIOD <BREAK>
But because so many of the issues in education aren't just in school ,COMMA they're in family and community ,COMMA what you also need ,COMMA definitely ,COMMA is more on the right hand side .PERIOD <BREAK>
You need efforts to supplement schools .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's an entire second adult lifetime that's been added to our lifespan .PERIOD <BREAK>
But many people today -- philosophers ,COMMA artists ,COMMA doctors ,COMMA scientists -- are taking a new look at what I call the third act ,COMMA the last three decades of life .PERIOD <BREAK>
They realize that this is actually a developmental stage of life with its own significance -- as different from midlife as adolescence is from childhood .PERIOD <BREAK>
I've spent the last year researching and writing about this subject .PERIOD <BREAK>
Obviously ,COMMA there's no guarantee that it can be a time of fruition and growth .PERIOD <BREAK>
It was about a man named Neil Selinger -- 57 years old ,COMMA a retired lawyer -- who had joined the writers group at Sarah Lawrence where he found his writer's voice .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's a terrible disease .PERIOD It's fatal .PERIOD <BREAK>
If however ,COMMA we can go back and alter our relationship ,COMMA re-vision our relationship to past people and events ,COMMA neural pathways can change .PERIOD <BREAK>
I mean ,COMMA as girls ,COMMA we start off feisty -- Yeah ,COMMA who says ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
We have agency .PERIOD <BREAK>
But very often ,COMMA many ,COMMA if not most of us ,COMMA when we hit puberty ,COMMA we start worrying about fitting in and being popular .PERIOD <BREAK>
Thank you very much .PERIOD <BREAK>
But most species actually use insects to do their bidding ,COMMA and that's more intelligent in a way ,COMMA because the pollen ,COMMA they don't need so much of it .PERIOD <BREAK>
The insects and other species can take the pollen ,COMMA transfer it directly to where it's required .PERIOD <BREAK>
There are markings on many plants that look like other insects .PERIOD <BREAK>
These are the anthers of a lily ,COMMA cleverly done so that when the unsuspecting insect lands on it ,COMMA the anther flips up and whops it on the back with a great load of pollen that it then goes to another plant with .PERIOD <BREAK>
And basically what the insect has to do -- we're in the middle of the flower -- it has to stick its little proboscis right into the middle of that and all the way down that nectar tube to get to the nectar .PERIOD <BREAK>
So not only has the fly not got the nectar from the mimic plant ,COMMA it's also -- if you look very closely just at the head end ,COMMA you can see that it's got a bit of pollen that it would be transmitting to another plant ,COMMA if only some botanist hadn't come along and stuck it to a blue piece of card .PERIOD <BREAK>
And when the insect gets there and lands on it ,COMMA dousing itself in pollen ,COMMA of course ,COMMA that it's going to take to another plant ,COMMA if you look at the every-home-should-have-one scanning electron microscope picture ,COMMA you can see that there are actually some patterning there ,COMMA which is three-dimensional .PERIOD <BREAK>
Sometimes the whole plant mimics an insect ,COMMA even to us .PERIOD <BREAK>
So flies love this .PERIOD <BREAK>
They lay their eggs in it ,COMMA thinking it's a nice bit of carrion ,COMMA and not realizing that there's no food for the eggs ,COMMA that the eggs are going to die ,COMMA but the plant ,COMMA meanwhile ,COMMA has benefited ,COMMA because the bristles release and the flies disappear to pollinate the next flower -- fantastic .PERIOD <BREAK>
This thing does something else which is unusual .PERIOD <BREAK>
Recently ,COMMA a wise media theorist Tweeted ,COMMA The 19 th century culture was defined by the novel ,COMMA the 20 th century culture was defined by the cinema ,COMMA and the culture of the 21 st century will be defined by the interface .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I believe this is going to prove true .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that's us down there in LA .PERIOD and Long Beach on the bottom .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is Baron Wolfgang von Kempelen's mechanical chess playing machine .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I think it's a pretty valid question .PERIOD <BREAK>
He draws sheep after sheep .PERIOD <BREAK>
So this is a clip from Charlie Chaplin's Modern Times .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's all I'm getting paid for this ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
So we resynthesized this song .PERIOD <BREAK>
And then you'd do your best to recreate that with your own voice .PERIOD <BREAK>
After previewing it and confirming it's what you submitted ,COMMA you could submit it into the Mechanical Turk with no other context .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'm sorry for this .PERIOD <BREAK>
And this was seen by a director in LA .PERIOD named James Frost who said ,COMMA Wait a minute .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I think one of my favorite parts of this project was not just shooting a video with lasers ,COMMA but we also open sourced it ,COMMA and we made it released as a Google Code project ,COMMA where people could download a bunch of the data and some source code to build their own versions of it .PERIOD <BREAK>
So we thought this was the perfect project to build a collaborative memorial and a virtual resurrection for Johnny Cash .PERIOD <BREAK>
Collaborator Five :COLON As much as is different from frame to frame ,COMMA it really is personal .PERIOD <BREAK>
But there's a bunch of different styles .PERIOD <BREAK>
There is a real problem with snobbery .PERIOD <BREAK>
imagine that snobbery is a distinctively UK .PERIOD phenomenon fixated on country houses and titles .PERIOD <BREAK>
Snobbery is a global phenomenon .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA the opposite of a snob is your mother .PERIOD <BREAK>
Think ,COMMA This is somebody who is incredibly vulnerable and in need of love .PERIOD <BREAK>
We're told ,COMMA from many sources ,COMMA that anyone can achieve anything .PERIOD <BREAK>
We are now in a system where anyone can rise to any position they please .PERIOD <BREAK>
They own their success .PERIOD But they also own their failure .PERIOD <BREAK>
But I think it's insane to believe that we will ever make a society that is genuinely meritocratic .PERIOD It's an impossible dream .PERIOD <BREAK>
What we fear is the judgment and ridicule of others .PERIOD And it exists .PERIOD <BREAK>
And then are fit for ridicule .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now is there any alternative to this ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And that's why we enjoy looking at glaciers and oceans ,COMMA and contemplating the Earth from outside its perimeters ,COMMA etc .PERIOD <BREAK>
When banking is no longer so respectable ,COMMA we lose interest in banking .PERIOD <BREAK>
But what I really want to stress is by all means ,COMMA success ,COMMA yes .PERIOD <BREAK>
Because the emphasis nowadays is so much on the justice of everything ,COMMA and politicians always talk about justice .PERIOD <BREAK>
But it doesn't matter that much that we're putting too much emphasis on that ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Thank you very much .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's a smiling face .PERIOD <BREAK>
And when I said I'm going to go out and do a 15 -hour swim ,COMMA and we're coming into the dock after a long day and it's now night ,COMMA and we come in and it's 14 hours and 58 minutes and I can touch the dock and we're done ,COMMA the trainer says ,COMMA That's great .PERIOD <BREAK>
Try going in with an armada like we had of 50 people and five boats and CNN's crew ,COMMA etc .PERIOD <BREAK>
And there are sharks .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I gathered together ,COMMA honestly ,COMMA the world's leading experts in every possible way .PERIOD <BREAK>
And a month ago ,COMMA the 23 rd of September ,COMMA I stood on that shore and I looked across to that long ,COMMA long faraway horizon and I asked myself ,COMMA do you have it ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
You're really left alone with your own thoughts .PERIOD <BREAK>
First of all ,COMMA you're going to hit obstacles .PERIOD <BREAK>
And even though you're feeling great at any one moment ,COMMA don't take it for granted ,COMMA be ready ,COMMA because there's going to be pain ,COMMA there's going to be suffering .PERIOD <BREAK>
After a couple of days ,COMMA three days ,COMMA you tend to rebel in a lot of physical ways .PERIOD <BREAK>
I don't know if you can still see the red line here and up the arm .PERIOD <BREAK>
He's 29 years old ,COMMA very well-built ,COMMA lean ,COMMA he's six-foot ,COMMA five ,COMMA weighs 265 lbs ,COMMA and he is down .PERIOD <BREAK>
I need help ,COMMA and I can't help Diana .PERIOD <BREAK>
The box jelly again -- all across the neck ,COMMA all across here .PERIOD <BREAK>
We've got benadryl on board .PERIOD If I get stung ,COMMA I'll just grin and bear it .PERIOD <BREAK>
And they have these long 30 to 40 to 50 -ft .PERIOD tentacles .PERIOD <BREAK>
Henry ,COMMA what's your question ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And I said ,COMMA Well it's odd that you've learned of this as a noble kind of pursuit ,COMMA but yeah ,COMMA I know those guys .PERIOD <BREAK>
He said ,COMMA That's what you need .PERIOD <BREAK>
Thank you .PERIOD <BREAK>
This hope is still alive .PERIOD <BREAK>
Are you going to swim the Atlantic ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
I said ,COMMA Nope .PERIOD I didn't know .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I left everything and went for a long series of odd jobs .PERIOD <BREAK>
They come in a lot of different shapes .PERIOD <BREAK>
So I'm always looking for the false cognates or identical words in different languages .PERIOD <BREAK>
So I did a series of work where it was identical words in French and in English .PERIOD <BREAK>
So if you don't know one of these languages ,COMMA it's instant learning .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's all if .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we can use them also as a safety net .PERIOD <BREAK>
People tell me their lives ,COMMA their memories ,COMMA their aspirations ,COMMA and I create a mindscape .PERIOD <BREAK>
I was also interested in the physicality of this format ,COMMA because you have to walk to see it .PERIOD <BREAK>
So it's like the different layers of what we are made of and what we present to the world as an identity .PERIOD <BREAK>
Why do I call it a book ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
After eight years of rejection ,COMMA I was thrilled to get my first commission with the Percent for Art in New York City .PERIOD <BREAK>
Here it's faceted glass in the Bronx .PERIOD <BREAK>
Because if you sit a long time in summer in shorts ,COMMA you will walk away with temporary branding of the story element on your thighs .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's a story about transformation and connections .PERIOD <BREAK>
And here I've been working for the last three years with a South Bronx developer to bring art to life to low-income buildings and affordable housing .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I wanted to give them an escape .PERIOD <BREAK>
But the result is always to have stories .PERIOD <BREAK>
And you get to think about yourself and your memories ,COMMA and before you go back into suspension ,COMMA you edit your memories and you change your personality and so forth .PERIOD <BREAK>
But lots of people now live to 90 or 100 ,COMMA unless they shake hands too much or something like that .PERIOD <BREAK>
Which ,COMMA by chimpanzee standards ,COMMA is very good indeed .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I guess I better skip all the rest of this ,COMMA which are some details on how we might make those smart machines and -- -- and the main idea is in fact that the core of a really smart machine is one that recognizes that a certain kind of problem is facing you .PERIOD <BREAK>
Any guesses ?QUESTIONMARK 1816 .PERIOD <BREAK>
What has changed our society has been wireless devices .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is the first one .PERIOD This is an electrocardiogram .PERIOD <BREAK>
In the future you're going to be checking all your vital signs ,COMMA all your vital signs :COLON your heart rhythm ,COMMA your blood pressure ,COMMA your oxygen ,COMMA your temperature ,COMMA etc .PERIOD <BREAK>
If you're an expectant parent ,COMMA what about the ability to monitor ,COMMA continuously ,COMMA fetal heart rate ,COMMA or intrauterine contractions ,COMMA and not having to worry so much that things are fine as the pregnancy ,COMMA and moving over into the time of delivery ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And then as we go further ,COMMA today we have continuous glucose sensors .PERIOD <BREAK>
I didn't have one of those ,COMMA but I got the Fitbit .PERIOD <BREAK>
Of course how many here have any problems with sleeping ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And the wake time is in orange .PERIOD <BREAK>
OK .PERIOD So ,COMMA that's the first night .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA diabetes is one of the big ones .PERIOD <BREAK>
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .PERIOD <BREAK>
One of the ones I just wanted to mention :COLON The iShoe is another example of a sensor that improves proprioception among the elderly to prevent falling .PERIOD <BREAK>
One of them -- we're very fortunate -- is to develop a dedicated institute and that's work that started with the work that Scripps with Qualcomm .PERIOD <BREAK>
The wireless institute ,COMMA the West Wireless Health Institute ,COMMA is really the outgrowth of two extraordinary people who are here this evening :COLON Gary and Mary West .PERIOD And I'd like to give it up for them for getting behind this .PERIOD <BREAK>
There's also a tremendous number of techniques that chefs have developed ,COMMA some about new aesthetics ,COMMA new approaches to food .PERIOD <BREAK>
None of the techniques that these people have developed over the course of the last 20 years is in any of those books .PERIOD <BREAK>
Is there a way we can show people food in a way they have not seen it before ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Then each of the different little pieces around it explain some fact .PERIOD <BREAK>
Well ,COMMA that first cutaway picture worked ,COMMA so we said ,COMMA Okay ,COMMA let's do some more .PERIOD <BREAK>
Once you start cutting things in half ,COMMA you kind of get carried away ,COMMA so you see we cut the jars in half as well as the pan .PERIOD <BREAK>
And each of these text blocks explains a key thing that's going on .PERIOD <BREAK>
But to make them palatable ,COMMA we cut it out of a steel plate and put it in front of a fire and photographed it like this .PERIOD <BREAK>
Everybody knows that your various appliances have wattage ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
As it comes out of the grinder ,COMMA you just have a little tray ,COMMA and you just take it off in little passes ,COMMA build it up ,COMMA slice it vertically .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now watch closely .PERIOD This is popcorn .PERIOD I'll explain it here .PERIOD <BREAK>
The popcorn is illustrating a key thing in physics .PERIOD <BREAK>
But surgeons in these eras are a little bit more conservative than their bold ,COMMA trephinating ancestors .PERIOD <BREAK>
And he is credited with doing over 4000 of these public surgeries ,COMMA wandering around in Europe ,COMMA which is an astonishing number ,COMMA when you think that surgery must have been a last resort .PERIOD <BREAK>
Joseph Lister was aepsis's ,COMMA or sterility's ,COMMA biggest advocate ,COMMA to a very very skeptical bunch of surgeons .PERIOD <BREAK>
The Mayo brothers came out to visit Lister in Europe .PERIOD <BREAK>
Something so simple .PERIOD <BREAK>
Laparoscopy is doing this kind of surgery :COLON surgery with long instruments through small incisions .PERIOD <BREAK>
But there were casualties of this revolution .PERIOD <BREAK>
They had to give up their wrists .PERIOD <BREAK>
They had to give up intuitive motion in the instruments .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA what you put between those instruments and those hands ,COMMA is a large ,COMMA fairly complicated robot .PERIOD <BREAK>
And since this was introduced in 1999 ,COMMA a lot of these robots have been out and being used for surgical procedures like a prostatectomy ,COMMA which is a prostate deep in the pelvis ,COMMA and it requires fine dissection and delicate manipulation to be able to get a good surgical outcome .PERIOD <BREAK>
More useful than a solid gold surgeon ,COMMA but ,COMMA still ,COMMA it's a fairly big capital investment .PERIOD <BREAK>
It has to be able to come off of the centerline and then be able to work back toward that centerline .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's not so simple .PERIOD <BREAK>
For the patient ,COMMA however ,COMMA it's transparent .PERIOD This is all they're going to see .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's very exciting to think where we get to go with this .PERIOD <BREAK>
As we take these capabilities ,COMMA and we get to go to the next places ,COMMA we get to decide what our new surgeries are going to be .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I think to really get the rest of the way in that revolution ,COMMA we need to not just take our hands in in new ways ,COMMA we also need to take our eyes in in new ways .PERIOD <BREAK>
We need to see beyond the surface .PERIOD <BREAK>
You know for me ,COMMA the interest in contemporary forms of slavery started with a leaflet that I picked up in London .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I'm going to admit to hubris .PERIOD <BREAK>
It was mind-blowing .PERIOD <BREAK>
But in fact that kind of bluey color are the countries where we can't find any cases of slavery .PERIOD <BREAK>
Well ,COMMA it builds up with these factors .PERIOD <BREAK>
Add in the increased vulnerability of very large numbers of people in the developing world ,COMMA caused by civil wars ,COMMA ethnic conflicts ,COMMA kleptocratic governments ,COMMA disease .PERIOD you name it ,COMMA you know it .PERIOD <BREAK>
But if corruption creeps in and people don't have the opportunity to have that protection of the rule of law ,COMMA then if you can use violence ,COMMA if you can use violence with impunity ,COMMA you can reach out and harvest the vulnerable into slavery .PERIOD <BREAK>
All around the world I've been told an almost identical story .PERIOD <BREAK>
They said ,COMMA That guy looked sketchy .PERIOD I was suspicious ,COMMA but my children were hungry .PERIOD <BREAK>
We needed medicine .PERIOD <BREAK>
Ten miles ,COMMA 100 miles ,COMMA 1000 miles later ,COMMA they find themselves in dirty ,COMMA dangerous ,COMMA demeaning work .PERIOD <BREAK>
Africans and Indians ,COMMA as usual ,COMMA South Americans ,COMMA and Eastern Europeans in particular are on our buy list .PERIOD <BREAK>
D :COLON Interesting .PERIOD Micheal ,COMMA bottom line ,COMMA what do you recommend ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Kevin Bales :COLON Okay ,COMMA you figured it out .PERIOD That's a spoof .PERIOD <BREAK>
Slaves cost between 3000 to 8000 dollars in North America ,COMMA but I could take you places in India or Nepal where human beings can be acquired for five or 10 dollars .PERIOD <BREAK>
They key here is that people have ceased to be that capital purchase item and become like Styrofoam cups .PERIOD <BREAK>
You buy them cheaply ,COMMA you use them ,COMMA you crumple them up ,COMMA and then when you're done with them you just throw them away .PERIOD <BREAK>
I've got to say ,COMMA one of the most exciting parts about my job is that I get to ,COMMA and I want to introduce you to one of those .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is not James ,COMMA this is one of the kids that he works with .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it can be done .PERIOD <BREAK>
Liberation ,COMMA and more importantly all the work that comes after liberation .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is what liberation really looks like .PERIOD <BREAK>
She said ,COMMA No ,COMMA because we've got hope now .PERIOD <BREAK>
Okay ,COMMA thank you so much .PERIOD <BREAK>
Despite the New York Times' and Vanity Fair's best efforts recently ,COMMA they're not brothers .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is actually a training film for a clown college that they had .PERIOD <BREAK>
There is a picture of Charles .PERIOD So let's watch the next clip .PERIOD <BREAK>
But people live on this land .PERIOD <BREAK>
So what we're going to see is some of the icons of Eames furniture .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I'm really here to talk about design .PERIOD <BREAK>
And this is a little film I made about the making of the Eames lounge chair .PERIOD <BREAK>
Because it just kind of ,COMMA you know ,COMMA doesn't get any more basic than that .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is a relatively famous chair .PERIOD <BREAK>
But doing these splints they learned a lot about the manufacturing process ,COMMA which was incredibly important to them .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'm trying to show you too much ,COMMA because I want you to really get a broth of ideas and images .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is a house that Charles and Ray designed .PERIOD <BREAK>
My sister is chasing someone else .PERIOD It's not me .PERIOD <BREAK>
Although I endorse heartily the fact that he stole her diary ,COMMA it's not me .PERIOD <BREAK>
The house is 1949 .PERIOD <BREAK>
And now I'm going to test you .PERIOD <BREAK>
I hope you had a nice time at Buddy's party .PERIOD <BREAK>
And they honor events in the linear world from the fictional world .PERIOD <BREAK>
And then Embassy Row is actually a historical site ,COMMA because in the Kymaerican story this is where the Parisian Diaspora started ,COMMA where there embassy was .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the town has really embraced it .PERIOD <BREAK>
And you're kind of trapped in the texture of Kymaerica .PERIOD <BREAK>
And this is Cranbrook .PERIOD I've got a real treat for you ,COMMA which is the first film that Charles ever made .PERIOD <BREAK>
And he made it for the 1939 faculty exhibition .PERIOD <BREAK>
You want to learn how to make films ?QUESTIONMARK Go make a movie .PERIOD <BREAK>
So my point is that this scope of vision ,COMMA this holistic vision of design ,COMMA was with them from the beginning .PERIOD <BREAK>
It wasn't like Oh ,COMMA we made some chairs and got successful .PERIOD <BREAK>
So we're going to do the last clip .PERIOD <BREAK>
And part of why this stuff is important and all the things that we do are important ,COMMA is that these are the ideas we need .PERIOD <BREAK>
And ,COMMA working on the idea that the cheapest electric toaster would also be the simplest to reverse-engineer ,COMMA I went and bought the cheapest toaster I could find ,COMMA took it home and was kind of dismayed to discover that ,COMMA inside this object ,COMMA which I'd bought for just 349 pounds ,COMMA there were 400 different bits made out of a hundred-plus different materials .PERIOD <BREAK>
Can I come up and get some iron ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
But after some nagging ,COMMA I got him to do that .PERIOD <BREAK>
But instead of a bellows ,COMMA I had a leaf blower .PERIOD <BREAK>
Plastic is the defining feature of cheap electrical goods .PERIOD <BREAK>
And you can actually make plastic from obviously oils which come from plants ,COMMA but also from starches .PERIOD <BREAK>
So this is attempting to make potato starch plastic .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it was looking good for a while ,COMMA but I left it outside ,COMMA because you had to leave it outside to dry ,COMMA and unfortunately I came back and there were snails eating the unhydrolyzed bits of potato .PERIOD <BREAK>
So kind of out of desperation ,COMMA I decided that I could think laterally .PERIOD <BREAK>
And there it is on the shelves .PERIOD <BREAK>
I don't know if you could see ,COMMA but I was never able to make insulation for the wires .PERIOD <BREAK>
They were trying to catch fish .PERIOD <BREAK>
However ,COMMA the report focused on what had already occurred and offered no information on what to expect now .PERIOD <BREAK>
Voice 1 :COLON It's coming again .PERIOD Voice 2 :COLON New wave ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
You know ,COMMA if you think about something like Google ,COMMA which essentially is relying on the collective intelligence of the Web to seek out those sites that have the most valuable information -- we know that Google does an exceptionally good job of doing that ,COMMA and it does that because ,COMMA collectively ,COMMA this disorganized thing we call the World Wide Web actually has a remarkable order ,COMMA or a remarkable intelligence in it .PERIOD <BREAK>
But what the blogosphere offers is the possibility of getting at the kind of collective ,COMMA distributive intelligence that is out there ,COMMA and that we know is available to us if we can just figure out a way of accessing it .PERIOD <BREAK>
A network is not just the product of its component parts .PERIOD <BREAK>
It is something more than that .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that phenomenon of piling on the existing links is one that is characteristic of the blogosphere ,COMMA particularly of the political blogosphere ,COMMA and it is one that essentially throws off this beautiful ,COMMA decentralized ,COMMA bottom-up intelligence that blogs can manifest in the right conditions .PERIOD <BREAK>
When we talk about bottom-up ,COMMA decentralized phenomena ,COMMA the ant colony is the classic metaphor ,COMMA because ,COMMA no individual ant knows what it's doing ,COMMA but collectively ants are able to reach incredibly intelligent decisions .PERIOD <BREAK>
But the pace of exponential growth is really what describes information technologies .PERIOD <BREAK>
It makes a huge difference .PERIOD <BREAK>
And Moore's Law was not the first paradigm to bring exponential growth to computing .PERIOD <BREAK>
When that comes to an end we'll go to the sixth paradigm ;SEMICOLON three-dimensional self-organizing molecular circuits .PERIOD <BREAK>
The Great Depression made not a dent in this exponential progression .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I was asked ,COMMA Well aren't you nervous ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And the cost of a transistor cycle ,COMMA which is a measure of the price performance of electronics ,COMMA comes down about every year .PERIOD <BREAK>
But that was really right on schedule .PERIOD <BREAK>
Communication technologies :COLON 50 different ways to measure this ,COMMA the number of bits being moved around ,COMMA the size of the Internet .PERIOD <BREAK>
Some critics say ,COMMA Oh ,COMMA well software is stuck in the mud .PERIOD <BREAK>
When I was a student it was across campus ,COMMA now it's in our pockets .PERIOD <BREAK>
All the intellectual property that is created and taught will be online and available ,COMMA and developed online in a collaborative fashion .PERIOD <BREAK>
Here is our founding meeting .PERIOD <BREAK>
So we're very appreciative of the support we've gotten from both the intellectual leaders ,COMMA the high-tech leaders ,COMMA particularly Google and NASA .PERIOD <BREAK>
Whole arm .PERIOD Shoulder disarticulation .PERIOD <BREAK>
Not in an envelope of a human arm ,COMMA with 21 degrees of freedom ,COMMA from your shoulder to your fingertips .PERIOD <BREAK>
You think it's bad to lose one arm ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
We have 14 out of the 21 degrees of freedom ;SEMICOLON you don't need the ones in the last two fingers .PERIOD <BREAK>
A couple of weeks ago we took it down to Walter Reed ,COMMA which is unfortunately more in the news these days .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's going to go inside something that we use in CAT scans and MRIs of whatever is their good arm ,COMMA to make silicon rubber ,COMMA then coat it ,COMMA and paint it in 3 D -- exact mirror image of their other limb .PERIOD <BREAK>
This weighs 69 pounds .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now he's going to pick up a pen with his opposed thumb and index finger .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's about 10 percent of our global needs and 100 percent of some island nations .PERIOD <BREAK>
It all began when two scientists ,COMMA Fred Grassle and Jesse Ausubel ,COMMA met in Woods Hole ,COMMA Massachusetts where both were guests at the famed oceanographic institute .PERIOD <BREAK>
They ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA are an endangered species themselves .PERIOD <BREAK>
So fishermen could only catch what they could either eat or sell that day .PERIOD <BREAK>
But this is no laughing matter .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's the sort of technology that's available today that really wasn't available even a decade ago .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so for animals that come to the surface to breathe ,COMMA such as this elephant seal ,COMMA it's an opportunity to send data back to shore and tell us where exactly it is in the ocean .PERIOD <BREAK>
For example ,COMMA the dark blue shows you where the elephant seal moved in the north Pacific .PERIOD <BREAK>
For animals that don't surface ,COMMA we have something called pop-up tags ,COMMA which collect data about light and what time the sun rises and sets .PERIOD <BREAK>
Geneticists have developed a similar tool called genetic barcoding .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so they put this together ,COMMA a list of all the species ,COMMA where they're known to occur ,COMMA and it really seemed like a very esoteric ,COMMA scientific type of exercise .PERIOD <BREAK>
So all of a sudden ,COMMA this labor of love for no obvious economic reason has become a critical piece of information in terms of how that system is going to recover ,COMMA how long it will take and how the lawsuits and the multi-billion-dollar discussions that are going to happen in the coming years are likely to be resolved .PERIOD <BREAK>
You can do this on a global scale ,COMMA but you can also do it on a regional scale .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now while a lot of the species we discovered in the census are things that are small and hard to see ,COMMA that certainly wasn't always the case .PERIOD <BREAK>
Similarly this Golden V kelp collected in Alaska just below the low water mark is probably a new species .PERIOD <BREAK>
This particular shrimp ,COMMA we've dubbed it the Jurassic shrimp ,COMMA it's thought to have gone extinct 50 years ago -- at least it was ,COMMA until the census discovered it was living and doing just fine off the coast of Australia .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now this little critter ,COMMA it's only about half a millimeter in size ,COMMA not terribly charismatic .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we also found this spectacular yeti crab that lives near boiling hot hydrothermal vents at Easter Island .PERIOD <BREAK>
That means 91 percent ,COMMA even after the census ,COMMA still remain to be discovered .PERIOD <BREAK>
But the really intriguing thing about the microbes is just how diverse they are .PERIOD <BREAK>
A single drop of seawater could contain 160 different types of microbes .PERIOD <BREAK>
The other point I'd like to make about this is that this ocean's interconnected .PERIOD <BREAK>
Census scientists worked in the rain ,COMMA they worked in the cold ,COMMA they worked under water and they worked above water trying to illuminate the wondrous discovery ,COMMA the still vast unknown ,COMMA the spectacular adaptations that we see in ocean life .PERIOD <BREAK>
So whether you're a yak herder living in the mountains of Chile ,COMMA whether you're a stockbroker in New York City or whether you're a TEDster living in Edinburgh ,COMMA the oceans matter .PERIOD <BREAK>
♫ I could show the world how to smile ,COMMA ♫ ♫ I could be glad all of the while .PERIOD ♫ ♫ I could turn the gray skies to blue ,COMMA if I had you .PERIOD ♫ ♫ I could leave the old days behind ,COMMA ♫ ♫ leave all my pals ,COMMA I’d never mind .PERIOD ♫ ♫ I could start my life all anew ,COMMA if I had you .PERIOD ♫ ♫ I could climb the snow-capped mountains ,COMMA ♫ ♫ sail the mighty ocean wide .PERIOD ♫ ♫ I could cross the burning desert ,COMMA if I had you by my side .PERIOD ♫ ♫ I could be a king ,COMMA dear ,COMMA uncrowned ,COMMA humble or poor ,COMMA rich or renowned .PERIOD ♫ ♫ There is nothing I couldn’t do ,COMMA if I had you .PERIOD ♫ Thank you .PERIOD Well ,COMMA thank you so much .PERIOD <BREAK>
And there's a cause for that ,COMMA all right .PERIOD <BREAK>
Well ,COMMA it's been around for 2500 years .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we do something different than what we did in the past ;SEMICOLON we add kind of a modicum of intelligence to that .PERIOD <BREAK>
If there are 15 operations ,COMMA you know that none of them work .PERIOD <BREAK>
You've heard that word several times in the last four days ,COMMA and everyone's familiar with Kuhnian paradigms .PERIOD <BREAK>
And by the human spirit ,COMMA I don't mean anything divine ,COMMA I don't mean anything supernatural -- certainly not coming from this skeptic .PERIOD <BREAK>
What I mean is this ability that each of us has to be something greater than herself or himself ;SEMICOLON to arise out of our ordinary selves and achieve something that at the beginning we thought perhaps we were not capable of .PERIOD <BREAK>
There has certainly been no argument about that in this room in the past four days .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA if we are to be the world's healer ,COMMA every disadvantaged person in this world -- including in the United States -- becomes our patient .PERIOD <BREAK>
I would like to quote one of my own household gods .PERIOD <BREAK>
Think about it .PERIOD <BREAK>
Rudimentary animal ,COMMA has a nervous system ,COMMA swims around in the ocean in its juvenile life .PERIOD <BREAK>
If you put a five year-old child's dexterity against the best robots of today ,COMMA the answer is simple :COLON the child wins easily .PERIOD <BREAK>
When it comes to being dexterous ,COMMA it's not even clear what the algorithm is you have to solve to be dexterous .PERIOD <BREAK>
But let me show you cutting-edge robotics .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now the Americans in the audience will know all about cup stacking .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it sounds like an easy problem .PERIOD <BREAK>
So the old days before digital radio when you were tuning in your radio and you heard crrcckkk on the station you wanted to hear ,COMMA that was the noise .PERIOD <BREAK>
So if you're lucky enough to be able to knock a small white ball into a hole several hundred yards away using a long metal stick ,COMMA our society will be willing to reward you with hundreds of millions of dollars .PERIOD <BREAK>
But we're going to represent beliefs with probabilities .PERIOD <BREAK>
But there's another source of information ,COMMA and that's effectively prior knowledge .PERIOD <BREAK>
But you know that your senses are not perfect ,COMMA and therefore there's some variability of where it's going to land shown by that cloud of red ,COMMA representing numbers between 05 and maybe 01 .PERIOD <BREAK>
That information is available in the current shot ,COMMA but there's another source of information not available on the current shot ,COMMA but only available by repeated experience in the game of tennis ,COMMA and that's that the ball doesn't bounce with equal probability over the court during the match .PERIOD <BREAK>
As we go around ,COMMA we learn about statistics of the world and lay that down ,COMMA but we also learn about how noisy our own sensory apparatus is ,COMMA and then combine those in a real Bayesian way .PERIOD <BREAK>
So that really means I have to make predictions of the future .PERIOD <BREAK>
Any discrepancy should hopefully be external .PERIOD <BREAK>
So as I go around the world ,COMMA I'm making predictions of what I should get ,COMMA subtracting them off .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we replay that to the other hand with a time delay .PERIOD <BREAK>
And based on this illustration ,COMMA we really convinced ourselves in the field that the brain's making precise predictions and subtracting them off from the sensations .PERIOD <BREAK>
So we were looking for a much more objective way to assess this phenomena .PERIOD <BREAK>
So if they retaliate with the same force ,COMMA the first person will think it's been escalated .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now we don't work with children ,COMMA we don't work with hitting ,COMMA but the concept is identical .PERIOD <BREAK>
We started with a motor with a little lever ,COMMA a little force transfuser .PERIOD <BREAK>
So it re-shows the brain makes predictions and fundamentally changes the precepts .PERIOD <BREAK>
But we've got a problem .PERIOD <BREAK>
And there's a big gap between the task and the movement system .PERIOD <BREAK>
I could choose these two paths out of an infinite number of paths .PERIOD <BREAK>
Maybe we don't all quite move the same way .PERIOD <BREAK>
But there's noise added to this .PERIOD <BREAK>
So if I pick the same command through many times ,COMMA I will get a different noisy version each time ,COMMA because noise changes each time .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the fundamental idea is you want to plan your movements so as to minimize the negative consequence of the noise .PERIOD <BREAK>
So you want to avoid big forces as one principle .PERIOD <BREAK>
So we've shown that using this ,COMMA we can explain a huge amount of data -- that exactly people are going about their lives planning movements so as to minimize negative consequences of noise .PERIOD <BREAK>
All the conversation stopped .PERIOD All the eyes turned to me .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so ,COMMA what I'd like to do now is to tell you about what we've learned in those journeys .PERIOD <BREAK>
They put smart skylights through their stores so they could harvest the daylight and reduce the lighting demands .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA let me tell you this :COLON when Wal-Mart achieves 20 percent energy reductions ,COMMA that's going to be a very big deal .PERIOD But I'm afraid it's not enough .PERIOD <BREAK>
Well ,COMMA Bob said the most important thing we could do right now is to make it clear in Sacramento ,COMMA California that we need a market-based system of mandates that's going to cap and reduce greenhouse gases in California .PERIOD <BREAK>
Here's a story about national policy that we could all learn from .PERIOD <BREAK>
They'd run ethanol or ordinary gasoline .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA what's happened in Brazil is ,COMMA they've replaced 40 percent of the gasoline consumed by their automotive fleet with ethanol .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA a team of Berkeley researchers with 15 million dollars from the Gates Foundation is engineering ,COMMA designing a radical new way to make the key ingredient ,COMMA called artemisinin ,COMMA and they're going to make that drug 10 times cheaper .PERIOD <BREAK>
Well ,COMMA I'll tell you -- a lot .PERIOD <BREAK>
Second fact :COLON the President's new budget for renewable energy is barely a billion dollars in total .PERIOD <BREAK>
Third fact :COLON I bet you didn't know that there's enough energy in hot rocks under the country to supply America's energy needs for the next thousand years .PERIOD And the federal budget calls for a measly 20 million dollars of R&ampD in geothermal energy .PERIOD <BREAK>
Not enough to stabilize the climate .PERIOD <BREAK>
Not enough to keep the ice in Greenland from crashing into the ocean .PERIOD <BREAK>
We've got to make this economic so that all people and all nations make the right outcome ,COMMA the profitable outcome ,COMMA and therefore the likely outcome .PERIOD <BREAK>
It is the mother of all markets .PERIOD You remember that Internet ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
She's like ,COMMA Oh ,COMMA us .PERIOD I'm like ,COMMA Okay .PERIOD All right .PERIOD That's cool .PERIOD <BREAK>
And there's a dude selling these aftermarket weapons for Lego ,COMMA because Lego -- the Danish -- no ,COMMA they're not into guns .PERIOD <BREAK>
But the Americans ?QUESTIONMARK Oh ,COMMA we'll make some guns for Lego ,COMMA no problem .PERIOD <BREAK>
And at a certain point ,COMMA you look around ,COMMA you're like ,COMMA Whoa ,COMMA this is a really nerdy crowd .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'm kind of into this stuff ,COMMA and I'm going to stop being embarrassed .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so this is like this CAD program where you build it .PERIOD <BREAK>
I have to take a moment .PERIOD <BREAK>
There's a whole gray market for Lego ,COMMA thousands of home-based businesses .PERIOD <BREAK>
Let's see here .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's 300 million years per minute .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA this is frozen water .PERIOD <BREAK>
The most intriguing and puzzling measurement ,COMMA in my opinion ,COMMA we've obtained of Mars ,COMMA was released earlier this year in the magazine Science .PERIOD <BREAK>
And what we're looking at is the presence of the gas methane ,COMMA CH 4 ,COMMA in the atmosphere of Mars .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's because the northern hemisphere is the region of the ancient ocean basin .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that's because the water protected the basin from being impacted by asteroids and meteorites .PERIOD <BREAK>
Here's Hellas Basin ,COMMA a very very different place ,COMMA geologically .PERIOD <BREAK>
We addressed on the board the major questions that have not been answered .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the result of our meeting was a robotic rocket-powered airplane we call ARES .PERIOD <BREAK>
And our goal is to inspire the American public who is paying for this mission through tax dollars .PERIOD <BREAK>
How do we transport an airplane to Mars ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And we have it in something called an aeroshell .PERIOD <BREAK>
Because we have tested ARES model ,COMMA several models in a half a dozen wind tunnels at the NASA Langley Research Center for eight years ,COMMA under Mars conditions .PERIOD <BREAK>
We're ready to go .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is the ARES team ;SEMICOLON we have about 150 scientists ,COMMA engineers ;SEMICOLON where we're working with Jet Propulsion Laboratory ,COMMA Goddard Space Flight Center ,COMMA Ames Research Center and half a dozen major universities and corporations in developing this .PERIOD <BREAK>
Thank you very much .PERIOD <BREAK>
And my colleague ,COMMA James Fowler and I have been studying for quite sometime what are the mathematical ,COMMA social ,COMMA biological and psychological rules that govern how these networks are assembled and what are the similar rules that govern how they operate ,COMMA how they affect our lives .PERIOD <BREAK>
They actually diffuse through networks .PERIOD <BREAK>
You could have friendship relationships ,COMMA sibling relationships ,COMMA spousal relationships ,COMMA co-worker relationships ,COMMA neighbor relationships and the like .PERIOD <BREAK>
Or their altruistic or their charitable giving behavior might be influenced by their coworkers ,COMMA or by their neighbors .PERIOD <BREAK>
Nicholas Christakis :COLON B ,COMMA it's obvious .PERIOD <BREAK>
And what we show here is -- like ,COMMA here -- very few people are affected ,COMMA more and more and more and up to here ,COMMA and here's the peak of the epidemic .PERIOD <BREAK>
And if they nominate the party host as their friend ,COMMA that party host has a hundred friends ,COMMA therefore ,COMMA has more friends than they do .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA we thought we would exploit this idea in order to study whether we could predict phenomena within networks .PERIOD <BREAK>
And also ,COMMA we had them [actively] email us a couple of times a week .PERIOD <BREAK>
By monitoring the friends group ,COMMA we could get 16 days advance warning of an impending epidemic in this human population .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now in our case ,COMMA although it wasn't necessary ,COMMA we could also actually map the network of the students .PERIOD <BREAK>
We're going to take daily cuts through the network for 120 days .PERIOD <BREAK>
Every dot is a person ,COMMA and every line represents a volume of calls between the people .PERIOD <BREAK>
And in fact ,COMMA we are in the era of what I would call massive-passive data collection efforts .PERIOD <BREAK>
They're all kinds of ways we can use massively collected data to create sensor networks to follow the population ,COMMA understand what's happening in the population ,COMMA and intervene in the population for the better .PERIOD <BREAK>
One is quasi-active ,COMMA like the flu example I gave ,COMMA where we get some people to nominate their friends and then passively monitor their friends -- do they have the flu ,COMMA or not ?QUESTIONMARK -- and then get warning .PERIOD <BREAK>
They collect millions of points at a time with very high accuracy and very high resolution .PERIOD <BREAK>
They were gone in an instant .PERIOD <BREAK>
The Royal Tombs had been destroyed by suspected arson .PERIOD <BREAK>
Let me leave you with a final thought .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that was that an American congresswoman named Patricia Schroeder from Colorado met with a group of journalists .PERIOD <BREAK>
It will refer you directly to your congressperson ,COMMA to your US .PERIOD senator ,COMMA to your governor where divestment legislation is pending .PERIOD <BREAK>
For instance ,COMMA the referral of the crimes in Darfur to the International Criminal Court ,COMMA which the Bush administration doesn't like .PERIOD <BREAK>
He moved with the headlines .PERIOD <BREAK>
But ,COMMA uh-oh ,COMMA the killers are within the camps .PERIOD <BREAK>
Well ,COMMA if you denounce ,COMMA you're probably never going to get back in the room .PERIOD <BREAK>
You're un-owned .PERIOD <BREAK>
He started as somebody who would denounce harmdoers ,COMMA he would charge up to people who were violating international law ,COMMA and he would say ,COMMA you're violating ,COMMA this is the UN .PERIOD Charter .PERIOD <BREAK>
All the great progress in this country with relation to our adversaries has come by going into the room .PERIOD <BREAK>
There's going to be a lot of people .PERIOD <BREAK>
But it never struck me as it did that moment ,COMMA because on that image was a woman trying to nurse her baby ,COMMA and she had no milk to nurse .PERIOD <BREAK>
A hundred years ago ,COMMA we didn't .PERIOD <BREAK>
At our time in history ,COMMA these images are out of place .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is more than HIV/AIDS ,COMMA malaria and tuberculosis combined .PERIOD <BREAK>
And here you see a brain scan of two children -- one who had adequate nutrition ,COMMA another ,COMMA neglected and who was deeply malnourished .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so today we focus on not just passing out food ,COMMA but making sure the mothers have enough enrichment ,COMMA and teaching them about breastfeeding .PERIOD <BREAK>
It doesn't need to be refrigerated ,COMMA it doesn't need water ,COMMA which is often lacking .PERIOD <BREAK>
Eighty percent of the people in the world have no food safety net .PERIOD <BREAK>
And usually the institutions -- churches ,COMMA temples ,COMMA other things -- do not have the resources to provide a safety net .PERIOD <BREAK>
And if you fill the cup with local agriculture from small farmers ,COMMA you have a transformative effect .PERIOD <BREAK>
Many kids in the world can't go to school because they have to go beg and find a meal .PERIOD <BREAK>
It costs less than 25 cents a day to change a kid's life .PERIOD <BREAK>
Families need the help .PERIOD <BREAK>
So is this a hopeless cause ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Cameroon ,COMMA northern Cameroon ,COMMA boom and bust cycles of hunger every year for decades .PERIOD <BREAK>
Food aid coming in every year when people are starving during the lean seasons .PERIOD <BREAK>
You manage ,COMMA the village manages these warehouses .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the food banks are growing .PERIOD <BREAK>
We're seeing that now in the Horn of Africa where food prices are up 240 percent in some areas over last year .PERIOD <BREAK>
The shopkeepers are hiring more people .PERIOD <BREAK>
And they require that a third of that food come from the smallest farmers who would have no opportunity .PERIOD <BREAK>
I've gone out there ;SEMICOLON I've met with the small farmers who have built their livelihoods on the opportunity and platform provided by this .PERIOD <BREAK>
You look at the cost-benefit analysis ,COMMA and my dream is to take this issue ,COMMA not just from the compassion argument ,COMMA but to the finance ministers of the world ,COMMA and say we cannot afford to not invest in the access to adequate ,COMMA affordable nutrition for all of humanity .PERIOD <BREAK>
When a leader says ,COMMA Not under my watch ,COMMA everything begins to change .PERIOD <BREAK>
WFP's been able to leave 30 nations because they have transformed the face of hunger in their nations .PERIOD <BREAK>
Not only that ,COMMA transforming hunger is an opportunity ,COMMA but I think we have to change our mindsets .PERIOD <BREAK>
What's exciting is that over the last two or three years ,COMMA the government has spent 400 million dollars ,COMMA and they've allocated another billion dollars ,COMMA to what we call the Cancer Genome Atlas Project .PERIOD <BREAK>
The Cancer Genome Atlas is coming out now .PERIOD <BREAK>
There's also a field of proteomics that I'll talk about in a few minutes ,COMMA which I think is going to be the next level in terms of understanding and classifying disease .PERIOD <BREAK>
Cancer is an interaction of a cell that no longer is under growth control with the environment .PERIOD <BREAK>
The goal of me as a cancer doctor is not to understand cancer .PERIOD <BREAK>
You know ,COMMA if I measured your temperature over 30 days ,COMMA and I asked ,COMMA What was the average temperature ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
I mean ,COMMA this is a scary slide ,COMMA not to take an aside ,COMMA but it looks at obesity in the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA our systems today are dramatically different than our systems a decade or two ago .PERIOD <BREAK>
That is the most effective ,COMMA cost-effective ,COMMA best way we can do things today .PERIOD <BREAK>
Sounds are affecting your hormone secretions all the time ,COMMA but also your breathing ,COMMA your heart rate -- which I just also did -- and your brainwaves .PERIOD <BREAK>
It has the frequency of roughly 12 cycles per minute .PERIOD <BREAK>
There are eight expressions of a brand in sound .PERIOD <BREAK>
You all recognize that one .PERIOD This is the most-played tune in the world today .PERIOD <BREAK>
Why are we doing this ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
The first is ,COMMA it's essential for us to understand the human brain if we do want to get along in society ,COMMA and I think that it is a key step in evolution .PERIOD <BREAK>
And you may think that anesthetics work by sending you into some deep sleep ,COMMA or by blocking your receptors so that you don't feel pain ,COMMA but in fact most anesthetics don't work that way .PERIOD <BREAK>
99 percent of what you see is not what comes in through the eyes .PERIOD <BREAK>
They are highly reactive ,COMMA and they are super-plastic ,COMMA and so the autists are probably capable of building and learning a symphony which is unthinkable for us .PERIOD <BREAK>
They choose very carefully who they connect with .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we did that for tens of thousands of neurons ,COMMA built digital models of all the different types of neurons we came across .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we think this is species-specific ,COMMA which means that that could explain why we can't communicate across species .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA let's switch it on .PERIOD But to do it ,COMMA what you have to do is you have to make this come alive .PERIOD <BREAK>
There literally are only a handful of equations that you need to simulate the activity of the neocortex .PERIOD <BREAK>
Here we activate it .PERIOD And this gives the first glimpse of what is happening in your brain when there is a stimulation .PERIOD <BREAK>
We can ask ,COMMA Where is it inside ,COMMA if we stimulate it with a picture ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Fifty years ago ,COMMA when I began exploring the ocean ,COMMA no one -- not Jacques Perrin ,COMMA not Jacques Cousteau or Rachel Carson -- imagined that we could do anything to harm the ocean by what we put into it or by what we took out of it .PERIOD <BREAK>
I want to share with you my personal view of changes in the sea that affect all of us ,COMMA and to consider why it matters that in 50 years ,COMMA we've lost -- actually ,COMMA we've taken ,COMMA we've eaten -- more than 90 percent of the big fish in the sea ;SEMICOLON why you should care that nearly half of the coral reefs have disappeared ;SEMICOLON why a mysterious depletion of oxygen in large areas of the Pacific should concern not only the creatures that are dying ,COMMA but it really should concern you .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'm haunted by the thought of what Ray Anderson calls tomorrow's child ,COMMA asking why we didn't do something on our watch to save sharks and bluefin tuna and squids and coral reefs and the living ocean while there still was time .PERIOD <BREAK>
For me ,COMMA as a scientist ,COMMA it all began in 1953 when I first tried scuba .PERIOD <BREAK>
Since then ,COMMA I've used about 30 kinds of submarines and I've started three companies and a nonprofit foundation called Deep Search to design and build systems to access the deep sea .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I'm living proof .PERIOD <BREAK>
No matter where on Earth you live .PERIOD <BREAK>
Over time ,COMMA most of the planet's organic carbon has been absorbed and stored there ,COMMA mostly by microbes .PERIOD <BREAK>
You did a great job with the land ,COMMA the dirt .PERIOD <BREAK>
We need new deep-diving submarines .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's bad news for us too .PERIOD <BREAK>
We're putting hundreds of millions of tons of plastic and other trash into the sea .PERIOD <BREAK>
Millions of tons of discarded fishing nets ,COMMA gear that continues to kill .PERIOD <BREAK>
We're still killing bluefin tuna ;SEMICOLON truly endangered and much more valuable alive than dead .PERIOD <BREAK>
Using Google Earth you can witness trawlers -- in China ,COMMA the North Sea ,COMMA the Gulf of Mexico -- shaking the foundation of our life support system ,COMMA leaving plumes of death in their path .PERIOD <BREAK>
Together we had just broken the world speed record for a trek to the South Pole .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA many of you are probably saying ,COMMA Wait a sec ,COMMA is this tough to do ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
You'll be in a massive headwind .PERIOD <BREAK>
Virtually none .PERIOD All of our equipment ,COMMA including film equipment ,COMMA was charged by the sun .PERIOD <BREAK>
Look at that central building right in the middle of the picture :COLON that's the 130 -foot diameter library ,COMMA that is exactly the size of the base of the spaceship .PERIOD <BREAK>
Two days later ,COMMA the space traveler's manifesto explaining why -- just like we heard yesterday -- why we need to go into space :COLON trips to satellites of the outer planets .PERIOD August 20 ,COMMA 1958 .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that's why when you get something declassified ,COMMA that's what it looks like .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is Ed Day putting .PERIOD So each of these coffee cans has three pounds of C 4 in it .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA thanks to him .PERIOD <BREAK>
And now we have ground hazard assessments when you have a blow-up on the pad .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is the kind of stuff that's not been declassified ,COMMA just that people managed to sneak home and after ,COMMA you know ,COMMA on their deathbed basically gave me .PERIOD <BREAK>
And one part of NASA was interested in it but the headquarters in NASA ,COMMA they killed the project .PERIOD <BREAK>
So finally at the end ,COMMA we can see the thing followed its sort of design path right up to 1965 and then all those paths came to a halt .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it turned out to be quite fun in two ways .PERIOD <BREAK>
And to the extent you believe I didn't shrink the lines ,COMMA which I didn't ,COMMA I've proven to you that your eyes were deceiving you .PERIOD <BREAK>
Right ?QUESTIONMARK It's impossible to overcome this sense that this is indeed longer .PERIOD <BREAK>
Turns out that they got to 28 percent after mailing every household in the country a letter begging people to join this organ donation program .PERIOD <BREAK>
When you walk into the DMV ,COMMA the person who designed the form will have a huge influence on what you'll end up doing .PERIOD <BREAK>
What do you do ?QUESTIONMARK Do you pull the patient back and try ibuprofen ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
The other group of the physicians ,COMMA they said ,COMMA Yesterday when you reviewed the case you discovered there were two medications you didn't try out yet ,COMMA ibuprofen and piroxicam .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now think of it .PERIOD This decision makes it as easy to let the patient continue with hip replacement .PERIOD <BREAK>
The thing is is that no physician would ever say ,COMMA Piroxicam ,COMMA ibuprofen ,COMMA hip replacement .PERIOD <BREAK>
An online subscription for 59 dollars .PERIOD <BREAK>
These are the market share .PERIOD Most people wanted the combo deal .PERIOD <BREAK>
The answer was absolutely yes .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now you're getting it .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we also have more than five billion of these devices here .PERIOD <BREAK>
These 14 million cellular radio masts ,COMMA or base stations ,COMMA consume a lot of energy .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that creates a big problem .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's good for a nice suntan ,COMMA but otherwise dangerous for the human body .PERIOD <BREAK>
And multiply that by 10000 ,COMMA then you end up at 14 billion .PERIOD <BREAK>
Not usable for a YouTube video .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the light goes through that hole .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that signal is then converted back to a high-speed data stream .PERIOD <BREAK>
And not only integrate a photo detector here ,COMMA but maybe use the camera inside .PERIOD <BREAK>
So what happens when I switch on that light ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
But at the same time ,COMMA you see this video coming up here .PERIOD <BREAK>
So no one ,COMMA if I have a light here ,COMMA if I have secure data ,COMMA no one on the other side of this room through that wall would be able to read that data .PERIOD <BREAK>
So for me ,COMMA the applications of it ,COMMA to me ,COMMA are beyond imagination at the moment .PERIOD <BREAK>
And they use light to illuminate space down there .PERIOD <BREAK>
If you saw 2001 :COLON A Space Odyssey ,COMMA and you heard the boom ,COMMA boom ,COMMA boom ,COMMA boom ,COMMA and you saw the monolith ,COMMA you know ,COMMA that was Arthur C .PERIOD Clarke's representation that we were at a seminal moment in the evolution of our species .PERIOD <BREAK>
And ,COMMA you know ,COMMA we in the last 30 years in particular have seen this acceleration in knowledge and technology ,COMMA and technology has bred more knowledge and given us tools .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we've seen many seminal moments .PERIOD <BREAK>
You're walking around ;SEMICOLON your car has 12 microprocessors .PERIOD <BREAK>
Then we go along and create the Internet and connect the world together ;SEMICOLON we flatten the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
The DNA is organized in words ,COMMA call them :COLON genes and chromosomes .PERIOD <BREAK>
DNA is a very elegant molecule .PERIOD <BREAK>
This here is a bug in my genome that I have struggled with for a long ,COMMA long time .PERIOD <BREAK>
What is the code ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
then you can go about the process of trying to fix it and figure it out .PERIOD <BREAK>
For my wife :COLON eat three times as much and you never put on any weight .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's all hidden in this code ,COMMA and it's starting to be understood at breakneck pace .PERIOD <BREAK>
We can understand ,COMMA for example ,COMMA why we create plaque in our arteries ,COMMA what creates the starchiness inside of a grain ,COMMA why does yeast metabolize sugar and produce carbon dioxide .PERIOD <BREAK>
We can also look at ,COMMA at a grander scale ,COMMA what creates problems ,COMMA what creates disease ,COMMA and how we may be able to fix them .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA you have the genome and you say to yourself ,COMMA So ,COMMA if I plug this synthetic genome -- if I pull the old one out and plug it in -- does it just boot up and live ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And this is extremely profound .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA then what do you do ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
We can start to figure that out .PERIOD <BREAK>
And he had the best answer I ever heard to this question :COLON Well ,COMMA somebody has to .PERIOD <BREAK>
You cannot compete with the environment ,COMMA if you have an adolescent dog's brain .PERIOD <BREAK>
Go on ,COMMA something should happen now .PERIOD <BREAK>
No ,COMMA we go ,COMMA Puppy ,COMMA sit -- boom ,COMMA it's got it in six to 10 trials .PERIOD <BREAK>
He'll find Jamie wherever he is ,COMMA you know ,COMMA wherever kids are ,COMMA crushing rocks by a stream or something ,COMMA and take him a little message that says ,COMMA Hey ,COMMA dinner's ready .PERIOD Come in for dinner .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA at this point ,COMMA the dog knows what we want it to do .PERIOD <BREAK>
The dog lives with you ,COMMA the dog can get you any time .PERIOD <BREAK>
So the second stage in training is to teach the dog to want to do what we want him to do ,COMMA and this is very easy .PERIOD <BREAK>
And what we're doing ,COMMA in essence ,COMMA is we're teaching the dog ,COMMA kind of like -- we're letting the dog think that the dog is training us .PERIOD <BREAK>
And now the dog's really happy .PERIOD <BREAK>
There's several definitions of what a punishment is ,COMMA but one definition ,COMMA the most popular ,COMMA is :COLON a punishment is a stimulus that reduces the immediately preceding behavior ,COMMA such that it's less likely to occur in the future .PERIOD <BREAK>
The dog is actually euthanized now ,COMMA but this was a dog I worked with for a while .PERIOD <BREAK>
When the dog would try to leave the mat ,COMMA she would say ,COMMA Rover ,COMMA on the mat ,COMMA on the mat ,COMMA on the mat .PERIOD <BREAK>
How are you going to reprimand a grizzly bear ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Rover ,COMMA come here .PERIOD Rover ,COMMA come here ,COMMA you son of a bitch .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I went ,COMMA Oh my God ,COMMA do I do something ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
The husband won't clear up his clothes ,COMMA or the wife's always late for meetings ,COMMA whatever it is ,COMMA OK ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
You see it especially in the workplace ,COMMA especially from boss to employee .PERIOD <BREAK>
And this ,COMMA I would say ,COMMA is the biggest human foible that we have .PERIOD <BREAK>
Your kids are easy to train .PERIOD <BREAK>
We think how we do it -- one night in bed ,COMMA we're pregnant ,COMMA and then we're raising the most important thing in life ,COMMA a child .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it concludes in something that you see here ,COMMA that you actually wouldn't expect as being the result of rationality .PERIOD <BREAK>
I call it sort of shotgun flexibility .PERIOD <BREAK>
So what you're seeing now is actually the design of the building .PERIOD <BREAK>
So that was the core idea .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA once we had presented that back to them ,COMMA they agreed that this sort of core concept could work .PERIOD <BREAK>
The things on the -- on the left-hand side of the diagram ,COMMA those are the boxes .PERIOD <BREAK>
That skin serves double duty ,COMMA again for economics .PERIOD <BREAK>
So it's an unusual building for a public library ,COMMA obviously .PERIOD <BREAK>
That was the main sort of technology area in the building .PERIOD <BREAK>
You dizzy yet ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And it allowed us to go back to first principles ,COMMA and redefine fly tower ,COMMA acoustic enclosure ,COMMA light enclosure and so forth .PERIOD <BREAK>
They came to us and they said -- unlike normal developers -- they said ,COMMA We want to start out by providing a contemporary art museum in Louisville .PERIOD That's our main goal .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so instead of being a developer that sees an opportunity to make money ,COMMA they saw an ability to be a catalyst in their downtown .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that pro forma led us to a mixed-use building that was very large in order to support their aspirations of the art ,COMMA but it also opened up opportunities for the art itself to collaborate ,COMMA interact with commercial spaces that actually artists more and more want to work within .PERIOD <BREAK>
And there is a pedestrian corridor that they wanted to add that would link a series of cultural buildings ,COMMA and a view corridor -- because this is the historic district -- that they didn't want to obstruct with the new building .PERIOD <BREAK>
It also means that if an artist wants to invade something like a swimming pool ,COMMA they can begin to do their exhibition in a swimming pool ,COMMA so they're not forced to always work within the confines of a contemporary gallery space .PERIOD <BREAK>
OK .PERIOD Now ,COMMA you're 19 now ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And I tried ,COMMA and I made it .PERIOD <BREAK>
And you made it out of what ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And so ,COMMA and that windmill ,COMMA what -- it worked ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Yeah .PERIOD <BREAK>
So what did they make of -- that you were 14 ,COMMA 15 at the time -- what did they make of this ?QUESTIONMARK They were impressed ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Yeah .PERIOD <BREAK>
So that would produce irrigation for the entire village ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Because it gets into all sorts of crazy realms .PERIOD <BREAK>
♫ This is a loop ,COMMA feedback loop ♫ ♫ This is a loop ,COMMA feedback loop ♫ ♫ This is a loop ,COMMA feedback loop ♫ ♫ This is a loop ,COMMA feedback loop ♫ ♫ This is a loop ,COMMA feedback loop ♫ ♫ This is a loop ,COMMA feedback loop ♫ ♫ This is a -- All right .PERIOD I don't know if that was necessary to demonstrate -- -- but my point is it's the sound of self-destruction .PERIOD <BREAK>
There seems to be a rule in nature that if you get too close to where you came from ,COMMA it gets ugly .PERIOD <BREAK>
The oil was running out ,COMMA and a nuclear winter would finish us off .PERIOD <BREAK>
It just tells you they were both designed to fit the human hand .PERIOD <BREAK>
Homo erectus made the same tool for 30000 generations .PERIOD <BREAK>
Of course there were a few changes ,COMMA but tools changed slower than skeletons in those days .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's an extraordinary phenomenon ,COMMA but it's true .PERIOD <BREAK>
And more than that ,COMMA it's a confection of different ideas ,COMMA the idea of plastic ,COMMA the idea of a laser ,COMMA the idea of transistors .PERIOD <BREAK>
One goes extinct for the other to survive .PERIOD <BREAK>
So what sex does is it enables the individual to draw upon the genetic innovations of the whole species .PERIOD <BREAK>
So Oz is better at both spears and axes than Adam .PERIOD <BREAK>
Ask yourself how long you would have to work to provide for yourself an hour of reading light this evening to read a book by .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that's seven and a half seconds of prosperity that you've gained since 1950 ,COMMA as it were ,COMMA because that's seven and a half seconds in which you can do something else ,COMMA or you can acquire another good or service .PERIOD <BREAK>
They were a highly intelligent species .PERIOD <BREAK>
The reason :COLON because Tierra del Fuego is separated from South America by a much narrower straight ,COMMA and there was trading contact across that straight throughout 10000 years .PERIOD <BREAK>
The Tasmanians were isolated .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's not the same with language .PERIOD <BREAK>
With language we have to transfer ideas that we understand with each other .PERIOD <BREAK>
There will be wars ;SEMICOLON there will be depressions ;SEMICOLON there will be natural disasters .PERIOD <BREAK>
My work is about the behaviors that we all engage in unconsciously ,COMMA on a collective level .PERIOD <BREAK>
And as individuals ,COMMA we all do these things ,COMMA all the time ,COMMA everyday .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's like when you're mean to your wife because you're mad at somebody else .PERIOD <BREAK>
Or when you overeat because your feelings are hurt ,COMMA or whatever .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's 15 minutes of our cup consumption .PERIOD <BREAK>
And if you could actually stack up that many cups in real life ,COMMA that's the size it would be .PERIOD <BREAK>
I wanted to make a piece that shows the actual number of Americans who die from cigarette smoking .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we aren't talking about it -- we dismiss it .PERIOD <BREAK>
And strangely enough ,COMMA the only plastic surgery that is more popular than breast augmentation is liposuction ,COMMA and most of that is being done by men .PERIOD <BREAK>
My belief is that you don't have to make yourself bad to look at these issues .PERIOD <BREAK>
How can we investigate this flora of viruses that surround us ,COMMA and aid medicine ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
But evolution is a balance :COLON where you have fast change ,COMMA you also have ultra-conservation -- things that almost never change .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so we looked into this a little more carefully ,COMMA and I'm going to show you data now .PERIOD <BREAK>
Down here you can see slower evolution :COLON less diversity .PERIOD <BREAK>
OK ,COMMA so that's what we did ,COMMA but how are we going to do that ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
If you've got enough money to buy just a Camry ,COMMA you can build one of these too ,COMMA and so we put a deep how-to guide on the Web ,COMMA totally free ,COMMA with basically order-off-the-shelf parts .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so what we did -- and this is a really cool project -- we just started by making a respiratory virus chip .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's the scourge of daycare centers everywhere -- it's like boogeremia ,COMMA basically .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so it is not any one stripe or something that tells me I have a virus of a particular type here ;SEMICOLON it's the barcode that in bulk represents the whole thing .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's me ,COMMA getting a nasal lavage .PERIOD <BREAK>
Actually ,COMMA we thought the nasal tract might be full of viruses even when you're walking around healthy .PERIOD <BREAK>
So that's great ,COMMA but again ,COMMA cheap shot ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
So ,COMMA we built out the chip .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now we're using this chip .PERIOD And what are we using it for ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And this is what this looks like .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that is ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA what these particular cell cultures are chronically infected with .PERIOD <BREAK>
So let's do something a little bit harder .PERIOD <BREAK>
They did a CT scan .PERIOD <BREAK>
Switch antibiotics :COLON so they switched to another antibiotic ,COMMA Tamiflu .PERIOD <BREAK>
There's almost no epidemiology or studies on it .PERIOD <BREAK>
And why is that ?QUESTIONMARK Just lore .PERIOD There's no data -- no data to support whether it causes severe or mild disease .PERIOD <BREAK>
It doesn't make sense -- unless ,COMMA maybe ,COMMA there's a virus ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And this is a little phylogenetic tree to see how it's related to other viruses .PERIOD <BREAK>
Is it the case that these guys are just more susceptible to viruses ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
This was all done by folks in the lab -- I cannot take credit for most of this .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'm talking about the production of aluminum .PERIOD <BREAK>
The electrolyte is not a solution of salt and water ,COMMA but rather salt that's melted .PERIOD <BREAK>
So now ,COMMA how to choose the metals ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
I felt the thrill of realization when I knew I'd come upon the answer .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's pretty cool ,COMMA at least in theory .PERIOD <BREAK>
We go to the laboratory .PERIOD <BREAK>
No ,COMMA I hire a student and mentor him ,COMMA teach him how to think about the problem ,COMMA to see it from my perspective and then turn him loose .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I was able to attract really ,COMMA really good people ,COMMA people who share my passion for science and service to society ,COMMA not science and service for career building .PERIOD <BREAK>
I went to Aspen recently and stumbled into this song .PERIOD <BREAK>
♫ Black men go to Aspen ♫ ♫ and rent colorful chalets .PERIOD ♫ ♫ Giggle at the questions ♫ ♫ their mere presence seems to raise .PERIOD ♫ ♫ Get taken for men ♫ ♫ we don't resemble in the least .PERIOD ♫ Are you .PERIOD <BREAK>
And since they discovered those things ,COMMA it really stuck with them so much more ,COMMA and also they would experience their own failures ;SEMICOLON there was a failure-based aspect to learning there .PERIOD It was very important .PERIOD <BREAK>
And another thing that really impressed me a long time ago was Powers of Ten ,COMMA Charles and Ray Eames' film .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so I'm going to show you a toy today that I've been working on ,COMMA that I think of more than anything else as kind of a philosophy toy .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA we actually play through many generations here ,COMMA at the cellular scale .PERIOD <BREAK>
But basically ,COMMA this is the editor where we're going to design the next generation of our creature .PERIOD So it has a little spine .PERIOD <BREAK>
But really the goal here was ,COMMA within about a minute ,COMMA I wanted somebody to replicate what typically takes a pictorial artist several weeks to create .PERIOD <BREAK>
OK ,COMMA now I'll put some hands on it .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I can see how it might dance .PERIOD <BREAK>
I can also play with the dynamics of this world over time .PERIOD <BREAK>
And our cities are going to be at risk too ,COMMA because a lot of these are coastal cities .PERIOD <BREAK>
Here it is ,COMMA some indigenous life down here .PERIOD <BREAK>
You see ,COMMA now they've actually gone to tribal dynamics .PERIOD <BREAK>
I think I'll leave before they get hostile .PERIOD <BREAK>
But these are the things that we can kind of put in this little galaxy here .PERIOD <BREAK>
Because I think most of the problems that our world is facing right now is the result of short-term thinking ,COMMA and the fact that it is so hard for us to think 50 ,COMMA 100 ,COMMA or 1000 years out .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so I'm going to talk a little bit about that ,COMMA keeping in mind that we have a lot on the program here .PERIOD <BREAK>
What's in it for the ant ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
No ,COMMA it's worse than that .PERIOD <BREAK>
There are a lot of ideas to die for .PERIOD <BREAK>
The secret of happiness is :COLON Find something more important than you are and dedicate your life to it .PERIOD <BREAK>
Actually ,COMMA I think we're all responsible for not just the intended effects of our ideas ,COMMA but for their likely misuses .PERIOD <BREAK>
So let me just point out :COLON memes are like viruses .PERIOD <BREAK>
And you might think ,COMMA Well ,COMMA how can that be ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
They're made of information ,COMMA and can be carried in any physical medium .PERIOD <BREAK>
Not just the priests .PERIOD Everybody .PERIOD <BREAK>
After all ,COMMA the meme for Shaker-dom was essentially a sterilizing parasite .PERIOD <BREAK>
But among all those ideas that inevitably flow out into the whole world thanks to our technology ,COMMA are a lot of toxic ideas .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it's not our fault ,COMMA anymore than it's our fault when our germs lay waste to people that haven't developed the immunity .PERIOD <BREAK>
We drove to the Goodwill and we threw the sweater away somewhat ceremoniously ,COMMA my idea being that I would never have to think about the sweater nor see it ever again .PERIOD <BREAK>
I tell that story ,COMMA because it has served and continues to serve as a metaphor to me about the level of connectedness that we all have on this Earth .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's thrilling .PERIOD <BREAK>
First ,COMMA she talked about comfort ,COMMA status ,COMMA beauty .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we've started making curtains ,COMMA and not only is it beautiful ,COMMA but people can see status -- that you care about your children .PERIOD <BREAK>
Thank you .PERIOD <BREAK>
My job depends upon it .PERIOD <BREAK>
Up to and around about the Second World War ,COMMA conductors were invariably dictators -- these tyrannical figures who would rehearse ,COMMA not just the orchestra as a whole ,COMMA but individuals within it ,COMMA within an inch of their lives .PERIOD <BREAK>
Let's be under no illusions .PERIOD <BREAK>
Simply through singing .PERIOD <BREAK>
So we got some shows off the ground .PERIOD We started touring them internationally .PERIOD <BREAK>
One of them was Carmen .PERIOD <BREAK>
I want to play you a tiny clip of it now for no other reason than to give you proof positive that there is nothing tiny about South African music making .PERIOD <BREAK>
They don't read music .PERIOD <BREAK>
And yet ,COMMA ladies and gentlemen ,COMMA every single one of us on this planet probably engages with music on a daily basis .PERIOD <BREAK>
I've got a little experiment I want to try with you .PERIOD <BREAK>
T ,COMMA see it's the same as F in music .PERIOD <BREAK>
There I am like a bloody windmill again ,COMMA you see .PERIOD <BREAK>
The music will start ,COMMA and then at a signal from me ,COMMA you will sing that .PERIOD <BREAK>
One more time ,COMMA with feeling ,COMMA ladies and gentlemen .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's going to be Britain's first ever national disabled orchestra .PERIOD <BREAK>
Clarence :COLON I would rather be able to play an instrument again than walk .PERIOD <BREAK>
I only wish that some of those musicians were here with us today ,COMMA so you could see at firsthand how utterly extraordinary they are .PERIOD <BREAK>
If any of you thinks you want to help me in any way to achieve what is a fairly impossible and implausible dream still at this point ,COMMA please let me know .PERIOD <BREAK>
Haydn remonstrated with the prince ,COMMA but to no avail .PERIOD <BREAK>
♫ Like the heather ♫ ♫ on the hillside ♫ ♫ as they drove us ♫ ♫ from the Highlands ♫ ♫ Like the ice flow ♫ ♫ from the Arctic ♫ ♫ where we landed ♫ ♫ in Newfoundland ♫ ♫ There's a color ♫ ♫ to my sorrow ♫ ♫ There's a name for ♫ ♫ all this sadness ♫ ♫ Like the ocean ♫ ♫ in between us ♫ ♫ I am blue ♫ ♫ Blue is a river ♫ ♫ Blue remembered ♫ ♫ Blue water ♫ ♫ running clear ♫ ♫ Blue like a planet ♫ ♫ to a spaceman ♫ ♫ Blue river ♫ ♫ of my tears ♫ ♫ So I came here ♫ ♫ to the city ♫ ♫ where the dream burns ♫ ♫ like a furnace ♫ ♫ And I dazzled ♫ ♫ in these dark streets ♫ ♫ like a diamond ♫ ♫ in a coalface ♫ ♫ Then the cold wind ♫ ♫ from the islands ♫ ♫ blew a storm cloud ♫ ♫ across the new moon ♫ ♫ Like the gun smoke ♫ ♫ above the houses ♫ ♫ in my home ♫ ♫ Blue is a river ♫ ♫ Blue remembered ♫ ♫ Blue water ♫ ♫ running clear ♫ ♫ Blue like a planet ♫ ♫ to a spaceman ♫ ♫ Blue river ♫ ♫ of my tears ♫ ♫ Blue river ♫ ♫ of my tears ♫ Well ,COMMA the subject of difficult negotiation reminds me of one of my favorite stories from the Middle East ,COMMA of a man who left to his three sons 17 camels .PERIOD <BREAK>
Seventeen doesn't divide by two .PERIOD <BREAK>
The wise old woman thought about their problem for a long time ,COMMA and finally she came back and said ,COMMA Well ,COMMA I don't know if I can help you ,COMMA but at least ,COMMA if you want ,COMMA you can have my camel .PERIOD <BREAK>
They had one camel left over .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now if you think about that story for a moment ,COMMA I think it resembles a lot of the difficult negotiations we get involved in .PERIOD <BREAK>
As I've spent the last better part of three decades ,COMMA almost four ,COMMA traveling the world ,COMMA trying to work ,COMMA getting involved in conflicts ranging from Yugoslavia to the Middle East to Chechnya to Venezuela ,COMMA some of the most difficult conflicts on the face of the planet ,COMMA I've been asking myself that question .PERIOD <BREAK>
So how do they deal with their differences ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
But what we don't often see is that there's always a third side ,COMMA and the third side of the conflict is us ,COMMA it's the surrounding community ,COMMA it's the friends ,COMMA the allies ,COMMA the family members ,COMMA the neighbors .PERIOD <BREAK>
Perhaps the most fundamental way in which the third side can help is to remind the parties of what's really at stake .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we met in the Hague ,COMMA in the Peace Palace ,COMMA in the same room where the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal was taking place .PERIOD <BREAK>
And then he went on ,COMMA and then he turned to me and said ,COMMA You're an American .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now I don't pretend to have an answer to the Middle East conflict ,COMMA but I think I've got a first step ,COMMA literally ,COMMA a first step ,COMMA something that any one of us could do as third-siders .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so my question is ,COMMA yes ,COMMA let's try and resolve the politics there in the Middle East ,COMMA but let's also take a look at the story .PERIOD <BREAK>
Let's see if we can apply the third side to it .PERIOD <BREAK>
What would that mean ?QUESTIONMARK What is the story there ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Now as anthropologists ,COMMA we know that every culture has an origin story .PERIOD <BREAK>
That man ,COMMA of course ,COMMA was Abraham .PERIOD <BREAK>
What's the opposite of terrorism ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
It's taking an innocent stranger and treating them as a friend whom you welcome into your home in order to sow and create understanding ,COMMA or respect ,COMMA or love .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that's what comes to the first step here .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's the essence of the Abraham path .PERIOD <BREAK>
So what we discovered is that Abraham is not just a figure out of a book for those people .PERIOD <BREAK>
And just a couple weeks ago ,COMMA there was an NPR story on it .PERIOD <BREAK>
And they quoted a villager who said ,COMMA This walk connects us to the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
She's partially blind ,COMMA her husband can't work ,COMMA she's got seven kids .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so more and more walkers have come ,COMMA and lately she's begun to earn an income to support her family .PERIOD <BREAK>
So my question is ,COMMA if it can be done in Europe ,COMMA why not in the Middle East ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
That's walking Abraham's path .PERIOD <BREAK>
After a TEDTalk ,COMMA why not a TEDWalk ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
There's an old African proverb that goes :COLON When spider webs unite ,COMMA they can halt even the lion .PERIOD <BREAK>
If we're able to unite our third-side webs of peace ,COMMA we can even halt the lion of war .PERIOD <BREAK>
Well ,COMMA what is needed for the earliest possible warning of a heart attack ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
A means to determine if there's a complete blockage of a coronary artery .PERIOD <BREAK>
And if we had a computer put into the body of a person who's at risk ,COMMA we could know ,COMMA before they even have symptoms ,COMMA that they're having a heart attack ,COMMA to save their life .PERIOD <BREAK>
And what we tried with the pig was external electrodes on the skin ,COMMA like you see in an emergency room ,COMMA and I'm going to show you why they don't work very well .PERIOD <BREAK>
Next to it ,COMMA at 30 seconds ,COMMA you see this rise here ,COMMA then this rise -- that's the ST elevation .PERIOD <BREAK>
Then ,COMMA on Friday at 643 ,COMMA he began to get certain signs ,COMMA which later we had the pig run around -- I'm not going to go into this early stage .PERIOD <BREAK>
Finally ,COMMA if you're lucky ,COMMA you are treated in three or four hours after the incident ,COMMA but the heart muscle has died .PERIOD <BREAK>
And now I want to talk about something entirely different .PERIOD <BREAK>
So here's a picture of what we're doing .PERIOD <BREAK>
There's this migraine that is preceded by a visual aura ,COMMA and this visual aura ,COMMA by the way -- and I'll show you a picture -- but it sort of begins with little dancing lights ,COMMA gets bigger and bigger until it fills your whole visual field .PERIOD <BREAK>
Christina Sidebottom :COLON Well ,COMMA my first reaction was that it was -- looked awfully gun-like ,COMMA and it was very strange .PERIOD <BREAK>
The most severe headaches responded better after we did it several times ,COMMA and the unexpected finding indicates that even established headaches ,COMMA not only those with aura ,COMMA get treated and get diminished .PERIOD <BREAK>
Well ,COMMA responsive electrical stimulation means that we sense ,COMMA at a place in your brain which is called an epileptic focus ,COMMA which is where the epileptic seizure begins -- we sense there ,COMMA that it's going to happen ,COMMA and then we respond by applying an electrical energy at that spot ,COMMA which erases the errant signal so that you don't get the clinical manifestations of the migraine headache .PERIOD <BREAK>
That concludes my discussion of epilepsy ,COMMA which is the third invention that I want to discuss here this afternoon .PERIOD <BREAK>
We want to have some people ,COMMA who really know how to do this ,COMMA perform human engineering studies to develop the optimum design for the portable device for treating migraine headaches .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that is the second wish .PERIOD <BREAK>
We needed to take what we had built and create a platform out of it so that it could be used elsewhere in the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so there is a team of developers from all over Africa ,COMMA who are part of this team now -- from Ghana ,COMMA from Malawi ,COMMA from Kenya .PERIOD <BREAK>
What is the veracity level of what you're looking at ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
So you've got a lot of information .PERIOD That's great .PERIOD <BREAK>
Take the crowd and apply them to the information .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we are very happy to be part of the TED family .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's inevitable ,COMMA terrible ,COMMA but really what I want to talk about is ,COMMA I'm just fascinated by the legacy people leave when they die .PERIOD <BREAK>
A value for things with a personal touch -- an autograph book ,COMMA a soul-searching letter .PERIOD <BREAK>
If a fraction of this powerful TED audience could be inspired to buy a beautiful paper -- John ,COMMA it'll be a recycled one -- and write a beautiful letter to someone they love ,COMMA we actually may start a revolution where our children may go to penmanship classes .PERIOD <BREAK>
So what do I plan to leave for my son ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
I plan to publish my own notebook .PERIOD <BREAK>
I have no idea how I'm going to do it ,COMMA but I am committed to compiling his thoughts and mine into a book ,COMMA and leave that published book for my son .PERIOD <BREAK>
What's happened in the music world is there's a culture or an ecosystem that's been created that ,COMMA if you take some words from Apple ,COMMA the catchphrase that we create ,COMMA rip ,COMMA mix and burn .PERIOD <BREAK>
And what that's done is it's created ,COMMA like I said ,COMMA a vibrant community that's very inclusive with people continually working to connect musical ideas ,COMMA innovate them and keep things constantly up to date .PERIOD <BREAK>
Imagine making it free ,COMMA so that anyone in the world can have access to all of this knowledge ,COMMA and imagine using information technology so that you can update this content ,COMMA improve it ,COMMA play with it ,COMMA on a timescale that's more on the order of seconds instead of years .PERIOD <BREAK>
In fact ,COMMA a lot of this use coming from Unites States ,COMMA K-through- 12 schools because anyone who's involved in a school scale back ,COMMA the first thing that's cut is the music curriculum and so this is just indicating the tremendous thirst for this kind of open ,COMMA free content .PERIOD <BREAK>
We've been working with AMD ,COMMA which has a project called 50 by ' 15 ,COMMA which is trying to bring Internet connectivity to 50 percent of the world's population by 2015 .PERIOD <BREAK>
In particular ,COMMA a bunch of the projects that are funded by Hewlett Foundation ,COMMA who have taken a real leadership role in this area of open content .PERIOD <BREAK>
OK ,COMMA burn ,COMMA I think this is sort of ,COMMA quite interesting .PERIOD <BREAK>
How much would it cost in a bookstore ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Why does it cost 22 dollars ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Remember we took the book ,COMMA tore the pages out ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Imagine music XML that actually lets you delve into the semantic structure of music ,COMMA play with it ,COMMA understand it .PERIOD <BREAK>
Even the three wise men .PERIOD <BREAK>
Because we're saying that anybody can contribute things to this commons .PERIOD Anybody can contribute anything .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA thanks very much .PERIOD <BREAK>
I've been at MIT for 44 years .PERIOD I went to TED I .PERIOD <BREAK>
Everybody agrees that whatever the solutions are to the big problems ,COMMA they include education ,COMMA sometimes can be just education ,COMMA and can never be without some element of education .PERIOD <BREAK>
So with those as the principles -- some of you may know Seymour Papert ;SEMICOLON this is back in 1982 ,COMMA when we were working in Senegal .PERIOD <BREAK>
Here we're in the ' 80 s .PERIOD <BREAK>
And these kids ,COMMA their first English word is Google ,COMMA and they only know Skype .PERIOD They've never heard of telephony .PERIOD <BREAK>
Screw you .PERIOD Go to the back of the line and someone else will do it ,COMMA and then when you figure out that this works ,COMMA you can join as well .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the idea is to launch with enough scale that the scale itself helps bring the price down ,COMMA and that's why I said seven to 10 million there .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now once people start looking at this ,COMMA they say ,COMMA ah ,COMMA this is a laptop project .PERIOD <BREAK>
Because laptop economics are the following :COLON I say 50 percent here ;SEMICOLON it's more like 60 ,COMMA 60 percent of the cost of your laptop is sales ,COMMA marketing ,COMMA distribution and profit .PERIOD <BREAK>
OK ,COMMA I've been using laptops since their inception .PERIOD <BREAK>
The dual mode display -- the idea is to have a display that both works outdoors -- isn't it fun using your cell phone outdoors in the sunlight ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And in about 30 days we'll know for sure whether this works .PERIOD <BREAK>
Probably the most important piece there is that the kids really can do the maintenance .PERIOD <BREAK>
So this is just a mechanical engineering sort of embodiment of it for you to play with .PERIOD <BREAK>
Everybody thinks they know about education ,COMMA a lot of culture is built into it as well .PERIOD <BREAK>
Well ,COMMA guess what ,COMMA we're not .PERIOD <BREAK>
Because there's no market for post office trucks .PERIOD <BREAK>
You can spray paint it ;SEMICOLON you can do anything you want .PERIOD <BREAK>
That came from a 1960 paper on space travel ,COMMA because ,COMMA if you think about it ,COMMA space is pretty awkward .PERIOD <BREAK>
He said ,COMMA No ,COMMA no ,COMMA no .PERIOD Here's a better way .PERIOD <BREAK>
And he said ,COMMA Well ,COMMA okay .PERIOD <BREAK>
And if you were able to print out everybody in your cell phone ,COMMA the room would be very crowded .PERIOD <BREAK>
These are the people that you have access to right now ,COMMA in general -- all of these people ,COMMA all of your friends and family that you can connect to .PERIOD <BREAK>
But when you actually visualize it ,COMMA all the connections that we're doing right now -- this is an image of the mapping of the Internet -- it doesn't look technological .PERIOD <BREAK>
It actually looks very organic .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's that they're helping us to be more human ,COMMA helping us to connect with each other .PERIOD <BREAK>
We're just increasing our humanness and our ability to connect with each other ,COMMA regardless of geography .PERIOD <BREAK>
So that's why I study cyborg anthropology .PERIOD <BREAK>
and people are initially reluctant to tell you .PERIOD <BREAK>
We talk about things in relative terms .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so when we look at these PMTCT programs ,COMMA what does it mean ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Imagine yourself ,COMMA if you can ,COMMA you're a young woman in Africa ,COMMA you're going to the hospital or clinic .PERIOD <BREAK>
And you don't know who you can talk to ,COMMA because the truth is ,COMMA HIV is so stigmatizing that if you partner ,COMMA your family ,COMMA anyone in your home ,COMMA you're likely to be thrown out without any means of support .PERIOD <BREAK>
And this -- this is the face and story of HIV in Africa today .PERIOD <BREAK>
But we're here to talk about possible solutions and some good news .PERIOD <BREAK>
Our organization ,COMMA mothers 2 mothers ,COMMA enlists women with HIV as care providers .PERIOD <BREAK>
But if you wanted to understand what that surgery would do to your life ,COMMA you'd like to engage someone ,COMMA someone who's had the procedure .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so doctors and nurses -- they look up to them as experts .PERIOD <BREAK>
Men are not frequently part of pregnancy care .PERIOD <BREAK>
And this is so important in breaking through the stigma .PERIOD <BREAK>
And if we can change enough communities ,COMMA we can change national attitudes .PERIOD <BREAK>
We have the medicines ,COMMA we have the tests ,COMMA but how do you reduce the stigma ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
I've been afraid to tell everybody .PERIOD <BREAK>
How do you build a better health care system ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And our organization helps women across that bridge .PERIOD <BREAK>
The program is now working in nine countries ,COMMA we have 670 program sites ,COMMA we're seeing about 230000 women every month ,COMMA we're employing 1600 mentor mothers ,COMMA and last year ,COMMA they enrolled 300000 HIV-positive pregnant women and mothers .PERIOD <BREAK>
All of this is possible ,COMMA if we each contribute to this fight .PERIOD <BREAK>
Thank you .PERIOD <BREAK>
Then they irradiate our food ,COMMA trying to make it last longer ,COMMA so it can travel thousands of miles from where it's grown to the supermarkets .PERIOD <BREAK>
This man ,COMMA Joel Salatin ,COMMA they call him a lunatic farmer because he grows against the system .PERIOD <BREAK>
Since I'm home-schooled ,COMMA I went to go hear him speak one day .PERIOD <BREAK>
I want you to know that there are farmers' markets in every community popping up .PERIOD <BREAK>
Not too long ago ,COMMA my uncle said that he offered my six-year-old cousin cereal .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now we had a Harvard professor here -- she was from Harvard ,COMMA I just wanted to mention and -- and she was actually a professor from Harvard .PERIOD <BREAK>
The scales here are religiosity from zero percent ,COMMA or atheist ,COMMA to 100 percent ,COMMA Bible literally true .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now let's talk about some of the characteristics that are important for this revolutionary device .PERIOD <BREAK>
First of all ,COMMA it needs to be small .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA I bought this device from Clifford Stoll for about 900 bucks .PERIOD <BREAK>
Free Bird .PERIOD <BREAK>
OK ,COMMA one more time -- I'm just going to give you a little help .PERIOD <BREAK>
And finally ,COMMA we're going to put the Marriott Hotel and the Portola Plaza on the top .PERIOD <BREAK>
Mr .PERIOD Vice President ,COMMA I wish I knew how to quit you .PERIOD <BREAK>
And Sylvia Earle and I were on an expedition in this submarine 20 years ago in Japan .PERIOD <BREAK>
But when I got there ,COMMA I found lots of plastic garbage and other debris .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's in the mid-Pacific .PERIOD It's about five days from anywhere .PERIOD <BREAK>
So that's when I first learned of the Islands and had no idea what I was getting into .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's a very deep-water part of our planet .PERIOD <BREAK>
But we got up there ,COMMA and I had the unique and wonderful scientific opportunity and personal opportunity to get to a place that had never been dived and just get to an island and go ,COMMA Okay ,COMMA where are we going to dive ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Let's try there ,COMMA and then falling into the water .PERIOD <BREAK>
The Phoenix Islands and all the equatorial parts of our planet are very important for tuna fisheries ,COMMA especially this yellowfin tuna that you see here .PERIOD <BREAK>
So I thought the scenes of never-ending wilderness would go on forever ,COMMA but they did finally come to an end .PERIOD <BREAK>
They basically are one nation that controls most of the equatorial waters of the Central Pacific Ocean .PERIOD <BREAK>
And for some reason they didn't want me to come ,COMMA or it was hard to find a time and a place ,COMMA and it took a while ,COMMA but finally they said ,COMMA Okay ,COMMA you can come .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I was free for dinner ,COMMA and I went out to dinner with the Minister of Fisheries in Kiribati .PERIOD <BREAK>
It had occurred on land ,COMMA in rainforests of South America and Africa ,COMMA where landowners had been paid not to cut the trees down .PERIOD <BREAK>
So we had very strong leadership ,COMMA very good vision and a lot of science ,COMMA a lot of lawyers involved .PERIOD <BREAK>
So suddenly we had this area that we were protecting ,COMMA but now it appeared to be dead ,COMMA at least in the coral areas .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that's the story with climate-change heating .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we are now in the process of raising the full endowment .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I actually went to see some of the design companies in Hong Kong in my stay there .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I'll just give you one example .PERIOD I had gotten my first Walkman .PERIOD <BREAK>
Last November ,COMMA a museum opened in Tokyo called The Mori Museum ,COMMA in a skyscraper ,COMMA up on the 56 th floor .PERIOD <BREAK>
And ,COMMA for sure ,COMMA I haven't looked at the sky in the same way after spending an hour in there .PERIOD <BREAK>
You know ,COMMA one is :COLON just working without pressure .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is ,COMMA you know ,COMMA related to it :COLON getting out of the studio .PERIOD <BREAK>
Again ,COMMA we could supply the content for it .PERIOD <BREAK>
Icons like Batman ,COMMA Superman ,COMMA Wonder Woman and their colleagues will be teaming up with icons Jabbar ,COMMA Noora ,COMMA Jami and their colleagues .PERIOD <BREAK>
As Christian iconography got changed ,COMMA and swastikas were created out of crucifixes ,COMMA Batman and Superman were created by Jewish young men in the United States and Canada ,COMMA also going back to the Bible .PERIOD <BREAK>
Superman is not only sent to Earth from the heavens ,COMMA or Krypton ,COMMA but he's sent in a pod ,COMMA much like Moses was on the Nile .PERIOD <BREAK>
So 33 of the stones are smuggled onto the Nina ,COMMA the Pinta and the Santa Maria and are spread in the New World .PERIOD <BREAK>
To which he said ,COMMA Let them be ,COMMA because what they're giving us is worth a lot more than what we're paying them .PERIOD <BREAK>
So these 99 stones ,COMMA a few kind of rules in the game :COLON Number one ,COMMA you don't choose the stone ;SEMICOLON the stone chooses you .PERIOD <BREAK>
Well .PERIOD <BREAK>
We have Jabbar from Saudi who starts breaking things when he has the power .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'm like ,COMMA are all the girls going to be kind and merciful and the guys all strong ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
That's not timely .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that led to all kinds of things ,COMMA from being in curricula in universities and schools to -- one of my favorite pictures I have from South Asia ,COMMA it was a couple of men with long beards and a lot of girls wearing the hijab -- it looked like a school .PERIOD <BREAK>
Opened a theme park through a license in Kuwait a year and a half ago called The 99 Village Theme Park -- 300000 square feet ,COMMA 20 rides ,COMMA all with our characters :COLON a couple back-to-school licenses in Spain and Turkey .PERIOD <BREAK>
Rughal :COLON There must be something we can do .PERIOD <BREAK>
Dr .PERIOD Razem :COLON It's time to go ,COMMA Miklos .PERIOD <BREAK>
You are Noora the Light .PERIOD <BREAK>
I don't deserve it .PERIOD I don't deserve anything .PERIOD <BREAK>
Jabbar :COLON We're here to help you .PERIOD <BREAK>
Miklos :COLON No .PERIOD He gave me access ,COMMA and you want to reboot the [unclear] .PERIOD No more [unclear] .PERIOD <BREAK>
As the father of five sons ,COMMA I worry about who they're going to be using as role models .PERIOD <BREAK>
And torture's a terrible enough thing as it is ,COMMA but when it's done by your hero ,COMMA that just breaks you in so many ways .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA one of the things that I refer to when I -- about the importance of this message -- is that I gave a lecture at the medical school at Kuwait University ,COMMA where I lecture on the biological basis of behavior ,COMMA and I gave the students two articles ,COMMA one from The New York Times and one from New York magazine .PERIOD <BREAK>
Any boys and girls caught flirting would get married off immediately ,COMMA okay .PERIOD <BREAK>
The second one took place in upstate New York .PERIOD <BREAK>
She was actually coming out of an Amnesty International meeting .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the good news is there might be an easy solution to that ,COMMA and that's using our eyes more .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it mushroomed slightly .PERIOD Afghanistan and Iraq mushroomed now to 3000 billion .PERIOD <BREAK>
So there it is :COLON 227 billion is what Africa owes .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the recent financial crisis ,COMMA how much of this diagram might that figure take up ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
We need to imagine what a landscape of the world's fears might look like .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is Mountains Out of Molehills ,COMMA a timeline of global media panic .PERIOD <BREAK>
And there's a very interesting and odd pattern hidden in this data that you can only see when you visualize it .PERIOD <BREAK>
Let me show you this .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'll take answers .PERIOD <BREAK>
I wonder if I could make my life beautiful .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's the language of the eye .PERIOD <BREAK>
But of course ,COMMA China has an enormous population .PERIOD <BREAK>
And if it can do that ,COMMA maybe it can also change your behavior .PERIOD <BREAK>
But what it points to is that visualizing information like this is a form of knowledge compression .PERIOD <BREAK>
So heart is filtered out ,COMMA so I can see if I'm curious about that .PERIOD <BREAK>
So the data is now alive ;SEMICOLON this is a living image ,COMMA and I can update it in a second .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's even fun to engage with them because it's visual .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that is beautiful .PERIOD Thank you .PERIOD <BREAK>
I will show it to you .PERIOD <BREAK>
The top note that you smelled at the very beginning ,COMMA the cut-grass green ,COMMA what we call in perfumery -- they’re weird terms -- and this would be called a green note ,COMMA because it smells of something green ,COMMA like cut grass .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is cis- 3 -hexene- 1 -ol .PERIOD And I had to learn chemistry on the fly in the last three years .PERIOD A very expensive high school chemistry education .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA this is a totally insane idea .PERIOD <BREAK>
And my definition of a theory is ,COMMA it’s not just something that you teach people ;SEMICOLON it’s labor saving .PERIOD <BREAK>
If it does ,COMMA you put the glass down ,COMMA you go to a different bar .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA I showed this to a physicist friend of mine who has a profound distaste for biology ,COMMA and he says ,COMMA That’s easy !EXCLAMATIONMARK The things are a different color !EXCLAMATIONMARK <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA Fact B :COLON nothing in the world has that frequency except S-H .PERIOD <BREAK>
And in an enormous 40 -page paper in German he says ,COMMA at one point -- my wife is German and she translated it for me -- and at one point he says ,COMMA ganz widerlich Geruch ,COMMA an absolutely repulsive smell ,COMMA which is good .PERIOD Reminiscent of hydrogen sulfide .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it’s fair to say that if you look up somebody’s nose ,COMMA you’re unlikely to see anything resembling this .PERIOD <BREAK>
OK .PERIOD Now .PERIOD If something absorbs the energy ,COMMA the electron can travel .PERIOD <BREAK>
What’s nice about this idea ,COMMA if you have a philosophical bent of mind ,COMMA is that then it tells you that the nose ,COMMA the ear and the eye are all vibrational senses .PERIOD <BREAK>
He says to me ,COMMA I bet you cannot make a coumarin .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA coumarin is a very common thing ,COMMA a material ,COMMA in fragrance which is derived from a bean that comes from South America .PERIOD <BREAK>
And :COLON You’re completely wrong ,COMMA and I’m sure you’re completely wrong .PERIOD <BREAK>
Working with the Harvard Business School ,COMMA you'll see this example when you talk about minimum payment :COLON If you spent 62 dollars for a meal ,COMMA the longer you take to pay out that loan ,COMMA you see ,COMMA over a period of time using the minimum payment it's 99 dollars and 17 cents .PERIOD <BREAK>
But it's going to work .PERIOD It's more effective than just computational aids .PERIOD <BREAK>
Received very favorably by business .PERIOD <BREAK>
And there is some good news to report today .PERIOD <BREAK>
There is no way we should do business with companies that have agreements with stealth provisions and that are unintelligible .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now we come down to it ,COMMA relatives grieving .PERIOD <BREAK>
Never retreat to the 'glorious past' Keep to the track ,COMMA to the beaten track ;SEMICOLON Treat every day of your life as your last .PERIOD <BREAK>
Never acknowledge the ghost on the stair .PERIOD <BREAK>
Don't do it .PERIOD <BREAK>
You bodies are wonderful as they are .PERIOD <BREAK>
Youth can never come again ;SEMICOLON We have drunk the summer wine .PERIOD <BREAK>
Dearest ,COMMA do I love thee less ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Do I shrink from thy caress ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Lady lady ,COMMA do not weep -- What is gone is gone .PERIOD Now sleep .PERIOD <BREAK>
What of the titans of media ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And what of the Constitution ,COMMA That bully of last resort ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
At 30 my powers seemed mighty to me .PERIOD <BREAK>
Grown sick to our stomachs ,COMMA and sick of our lives .PERIOD <BREAK>
Um ,COMMA there are -- I've got far too much money and I have far too much fun in my businesses .PERIOD <BREAK>
I was in a clinic .PERIOD I wasn't allowed to make telephone calls .PERIOD <BREAK>
That was in October of 2000 .PERIOD <BREAK>
But sometimes I try to put myself in an evil man's position .PERIOD <BREAK>
But sometimes I try to put myself in that position .PERIOD <BREAK>
But it's interesting to me .PERIOD I love to write historical verse .PERIOD <BREAK>
I love to think what they thought ,COMMA what it was like .PERIOD <BREAK>
We're still doing it ,COMMA with all of the genius assembled in this room .PERIOD <BREAK>
And you stay up for 12 .PERIOD <BREAK>
But always we scrabbled to lie with her first .PERIOD <BREAK>
We are one species of about five and a half thousand mammalian species that exist on planet Earth today .PERIOD <BREAK>
You then hope that the earth moves in such a way as to bring the bones back up to the surface .PERIOD <BREAK>
In fact ,COMMA if you go back in time ,COMMA it is the norm that there are multiple species of hominids or of human ancestors that coexist at any one time .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I imagined him to be tall ,COMMA dark-skinned .PERIOD <BREAK>
We began to find limb bones ;SEMICOLON we found finger bones ,COMMA the bones of the pelvis ,COMMA vertebrae ,COMMA ribs ,COMMA the collar bones ,COMMA things that had never ,COMMA ever been seen before in Homo erectus .PERIOD <BREAK>
But also ,COMMA surprising finds recently announced from the Island of Flores in Indonesia ,COMMA where a group of these human ancestors have been isolated ,COMMA and have become dwarfed ,COMMA and they're only about a meter in height .PERIOD <BREAK>
And what is it that really makes us us ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
I think it's our collective intelligence .PERIOD <BREAK>
I had saved a few hundred photos of dodo skeletons into my Creative Projects folder -- it's a repository for my brain ,COMMA everything that I could possibly be interested in .PERIOD <BREAK>
Assuming it was roughly the size of my wife's hand ,COMMA I made some measurements of her thumb ,COMMA and I scaled them out to the size of the skull .PERIOD <BREAK>
Built out of words ,COMMA it is the engine that drives the plot of his book and also the movie ,COMMA in which another object is created :COLON a prop that has to represent the thing that Hammett created out of words ,COMMA inspired by the Kniphausen Hawk ,COMMA and this represents the falcon in the movie .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so now it was time to do some research .PERIOD <BREAK>
What do they do ,COMMA how do you start something like that ?QUESTIONMARK I really don't know .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I'm following all the light kicks on this thing and making sure that as I'm holding the light in the same position ,COMMA I'm getting the same type of reflection on it -- that's the level of detail I'm going into this thing .PERIOD <BREAK>
This thing was made of resin and it was too light .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's half the weight of my dog ,COMMA Huxley .PERIOD <BREAK>
On the far left is a piece of crap -- a replica I bought on eBay .PERIOD <BREAK>
So what do I do ?QUESTIONMARK I figure I have two options .PERIOD <BREAK>
One ,COMMA I can fire a freaking laser at it ,COMMA which I have already done ,COMMA to do a 3 D scan -- there's a 3 D scan of this Falcon .PERIOD <BREAK>
But really ,COMMA if we're all going to be honest with ourselves ,COMMA I have to admit that achieving the end of the exercise was never the point of the exercise to begin with ,COMMA was it .PERIOD <BREAK>
It was actually developed for use by the offshore oil industry for diving on oil rigs down to a depth of 2000 feet .PERIOD <BREAK>
If I go out in the open ocean environment ,COMMA virtually anywhere in the world ,COMMA and I drag a net from 3000 feet to the surface ,COMMA most of the animals -- in fact ,COMMA in many places ,COMMA 80 to 90 percent of the animals that I bring up in that net -- make light .PERIOD <BREAK>
So you turn on the camera ,COMMA turn out the lights .PERIOD <BREAK>
I knew my forward speed ,COMMA I knew the area ,COMMA and so I could figure out how many hundreds of sources there were per cubic meter .PERIOD <BREAK>
So it uses its red bioluminescence like a sniper's scope to be able to sneak up on animals that are blind to red light and be able to see them without being seen .PERIOD <BREAK>
And a lot of animals will use their bioluminescence as a lure .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA she's got a lure that she sticks out in front of this living mousetrap of needle-sharp teeth in order to attract in some unsuspecting prey .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA now we believe that the different shape of the lure is how the male recognizes the female in the anglerfish world ,COMMA because many of these males are what are known as dwarf males .PERIOD <BREAK>
Well ,COMMA this is a deep-sea version of Women's Lib .PERIOD <BREAK>
She always knows where he is ,COMMA and she doesn't have to be monogamous ,COMMA because some of these females come up with multiple males attached .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we were using a special trawling net that we were able to bring these animals up alive .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is an unbelievable light show .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA I've wanted for a long time to figure out a different way to explore .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's me on the left ,COMMA my graduate student at the time ,COMMA Erika Raymond ,COMMA and Lee Fry ,COMMA who was the engineer on the project .PERIOD <BREAK>
We're at the edge of the Brine Pool ,COMMA there's a fish that's swimming towards the camera .PERIOD <BREAK>
DNA :COLON Design ,COMMA Nature ,COMMA Art .PERIOD These are the three things that condition my world .PERIOD <BREAK>
All the guys in the rugby team couldn't understand ,COMMA but anyway -- this is a meringue .PERIOD This is another sample I have .PERIOD <BREAK>
It shows how you make one holistic form ,COMMA like the car industry ,COMMA and then you break up what you need .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's like 21 st-century Henry Moore .PERIOD When you see a Henry Moore still ,COMMA your hair stands up .PERIOD There's some amazing spiritual connect .PERIOD <BREAK>
We need to be in that realm .PERIOD I want to do stuff like that .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is two weeks ago in CCP in Coventry ,COMMA who build parts for Bentleys and so on .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is what goes on in my studio everyday .PERIOD I walk -- I'm traveling .PERIOD I come back .PERIOD <BREAK>
I said ,COMMA You get into biopolymers .PERIOD They looked straight through me .PERIOD <BREAK>
I've had this image of a water droplet for 20 years sitting on a hot bed .PERIOD <BREAK>
You see that thing .PERIOD You do .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'm not putting Charles Eames' furniture in buildings anymore .PERIOD <BREAK>
Who cares ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
This is called a Plasnet .PERIOD <BREAK>
These are my sculptures .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is a room of sleep-deprived women .PERIOD <BREAK>
And in the course of that ,COMMA I studied ,COMMA I met with medical doctors ,COMMA scientists ,COMMA and I'm here to tell you that the way to a more productive ,COMMA more inspired ,COMMA more joyful life is getting enough sleep .PERIOD <BREAK>
And our guide was a local science teacher .PERIOD <BREAK>
At the end of this day I could have filled a book just with stories about law from this one teacher .PERIOD <BREAK>
We lack even a vocabulary to deal with this problem ,COMMA and that's because we have the wrong frame of reference .PERIOD <BREAK>
The trial lawyers say ,COMMA Well ,COMMA this legal fear makes doctors practice better medicine .PERIOD <BREAK>
The fear has chilled professional interaction so thousands of tragic errors occur because doctors are afraid to speak up :COLON Are you sure that's the right dosage ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
it goes on .PERIOD We did a study of all the rules that affect one school in New York .PERIOD The Board of Ed .PERIOD had no idea .PERIOD <BREAK>
I mean it's just absolutely a formula for failure .PERIOD <BREAK>
And why not ?QUESTIONMARK They don't trust the law .PERIOD Why don't they trust the law ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Well how do you fix it ?QUESTIONMARK We could spend 10000 lifetimes trying to prune this legal jungle .PERIOD <BREAK>
But law is different than other kinds of uncertainties ,COMMA because it carries with it the power of state .PERIOD <BREAK>
If you make people self-conscious about their judgments ,COMMA studies show you will make them make worse judgments .PERIOD <BREAK>
Edison stated it best .PERIOD He said ,COMMA Hell ,COMMA we ain't got no rules around here ,COMMA we're trying to accomplish something .PERIOD <BREAK>
All these choices involve value judgments and social norms ,COMMA not objective facts .PERIOD <BREAK>
You can't run a society by the lowest common denominator .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA what's needed is a basic shift in philosophy .PERIOD <BREAK>
Law is a human institution ;SEMICOLON responsibility is a human institution .PERIOD <BREAK>
If the judge doesn't have the authority to toss out unreasonable claims ,COMMA then all of us go through the day looking over our shoulders .PERIOD <BREAK>
What the world needs now is to restore the authority to make common choices .PERIOD <BREAK>
The second thing I want to do is introduce my co-author and dear friend and co-teacher .PERIOD <BREAK>
We certainly can't trust the bankers ,COMMA and we certainly can't trust the brokers .PERIOD <BREAK>
And even as we do our own work ,COMMA all too often ,COMMA we find ourselves having to choose between doing what we think is the right thing and doing the expected thing ,COMMA or the required thing ,COMMA or the profitable thing .PERIOD <BREAK>
Or if they do have our interests at heart ,COMMA we worry that they don't know us well enough to figure out what they need to do in order to allow us to secure those interests .PERIOD <BREAK>
In addition ,COMMA we are struggling to find some way to create incentives for people in the financial services industry that will have them more interested in serving the long-term interests even of their own companies ,COMMA rather than securing short-term profits .PERIOD <BREAK>
If there is a lesson to be learned from the financial collapse it is that .PERIOD <BREAK>
A wise person knows when to bend the rules .PERIOD <BREAK>
A wise person knows when to improvise .PERIOD <BREAK>
And most important ,COMMA a wise person does this improvising and rule-bending in the service of the right aims .PERIOD <BREAK>
He was supporting his wife and a child ,COMMA and the child was going to parochial school .PERIOD <BREAK>
Then he lost his job .PERIOD <BREAK>
The judge on the case ,COMMA Judge Lois Forer thought that this made no sense .PERIOD <BREAK>
He did .PERIOD He served out his sentence .PERIOD <BREAK>
For Ms .PERIOD Dewey ,COMMA this isn't why she became a teacher .PERIOD <BREAK>
In the Veterans' Court -- this was the first of its kind in the United States .PERIOD <BREAK>
Why has the idea spread ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Anyone would glom onto a criminal justice system that has this kind of a record .PERIOD <BREAK>
So here's is a system-changer ,COMMA and it seems to be catching .PERIOD <BREAK>
Aristotle thought that practical wisdom was the key to happiness ,COMMA and he was right .PERIOD <BREAK>
Indeed ,COMMA we argue ,COMMA there is no substitute for wisdom .PERIOD <BREAK>
First of all ,COMMA we started off the nuclear age in 1945 .PERIOD <BREAK>
We had a few nuclear weapons ,COMMA two of which we dropped on Japan ,COMMA in Hiroshima ,COMMA a few days later in Nagasaki ,COMMA in August 1945 ,COMMA killing about 250000 people between those two .PERIOD <BREAK>
So the goal was to evacuate the target cities .PERIOD <BREAK>
We would move people out of the target cities into the countryside .PERIOD <BREAK>
This disconnect was never actually resolved .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA what is a nuclear terror threat ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
There are plans for how to create a terror farm where you could actually manufacture and develop all the components and assemble it .PERIOD <BREAK>
Since there is no real retribution possible that would make any difference ,COMMA since there are people willing to actually give up their lives in order to do a lot of damage to us ,COMMA it becomes apparent that the whole notion of this mutually assured destruction would not work .PERIOD <BREAK>
You take it wherever you want to take it ,COMMA and you can detonate it .PERIOD <BREAK>
You can't get an exact number for that kind of probability ,COMMA but what I'm trying to say is that we have all the elements of that happening .PERIOD <BREAK>
I don't think we would see an all-out nuclear war any time soon ,COMMA although even that is not completely off the table .PERIOD <BREAK>
There's still enough nuclear weapons in the arsenals of the superpowers to destroy the Earth many ,COMMA many times over .PERIOD <BREAK>
We're coming down ,COMMA and we bring that truck that you just saw somewhere in here ,COMMA in the Financial District .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is a 10 -kiloton bomb ,COMMA slightly smaller than was used in Hiroshima .PERIOD And I want to just conclude this by just giving you some information .PERIOD I think -- news you could use kind of concept here .PERIOD <BREAK>
And if you're in this vicinity ,COMMA you've got to get away .PERIOD <BREAK>
And if you're wearing clothing ,COMMA you've taken off your clothing ,COMMA you're going to get showered down some place and remove the radiation that would be -- the radioactive material that might be on you .PERIOD <BREAK>
Thank you .PERIOD <BREAK>
No ,COMMA no ,COMMA I wasn't 14 years old .PERIOD <BREAK>
I wasn't really a rocket scientist ,COMMA but I was working at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in sunny California where it's warm ;SEMICOLON whereas now I'm in the mid-West ,COMMA and it's cold .PERIOD <BREAK>
And he told me ,COMMA Biosignatures ,COMMA we need to look for a biosignature .PERIOD <BREAK>
And he said ,COMMA It's any measurable phenomenon that allows us to indicate the presence of life .PERIOD <BREAK>
But immediately the system goes like ,COMMA What kind of dumb piece of code was this ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
So you see waves of new types taking over the other types .PERIOD <BREAK>
As long as I know that there's some sort of alphabet .PERIOD <BREAK>
And obviously each of these letters comes off about roughly equally frequent .PERIOD <BREAK>
And if I look at French texts ,COMMA it looks a little bit different ,COMMA or Italian or German .PERIOD <BREAK>
It doesn't matter whether it's a poem or whether it's a mathematical text .PERIOD <BREAK>
The Avidians being the denizens of this computer world where they are perfectly happy replicating and growing in complexity .PERIOD <BREAK>
Too hot ,COMMA too hot .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I'm just showing this to you again because it's so nice .PERIOD <BREAK>
One of them is ,COMMA if we are able to think about life in abstract terms -- and we're not talking about things like plants ,COMMA and we're not talking about amino acids ,COMMA and we're not talking about bacteria ,COMMA but we think in terms of processes -- then we could start to think about life ,COMMA not as something that is so special to Earth ,COMMA but that ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA could exist anywhere .PERIOD <BREAK>
But what really turns me on about technology is not just the ability to get more songs on MP 3 players .PERIOD <BREAK>
What I would like to see is idealism decoupled from all constraints .PERIOD <BREAK>
Political ,COMMA economic ,COMMA psychological ,COMMA whatever .PERIOD <BREAK>
Don't ask .PERIOD <BREAK>
Well ,COMMA I turned him down .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's not a cause .PERIOD That's an emergency .PERIOD <BREAK>
And what we're facing in Africa is an unprecedented threat to human dignity and equality .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's right .PERIOD <BREAK>
We like to give ,COMMA and we give a lot .PERIOD <BREAK>
You see ,COMMA Africa makes a fool of our idea of justice .PERIOD <BREAK>
Africa is a continent in flames .PERIOD <BREAK>
Anyway ,COMMA I believe that that kind of thinking offends the intellectual rigor in this room .PERIOD <BREAK>
There's an opportunity here ,COMMA and it's real .PERIOD <BREAK>
Our credibility ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
I can't ;SEMICOLON you can't ,COMMA as individuals ;SEMICOLON but we can change the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
But working together ,COMMA we can actually change the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
Ideas that you gestated in your youth .PERIOD <BREAK>
Well ,COMMA now ,COMMA actually because of you ,COMMA it is possible to change the physical world .PERIOD <BREAK>
So why ,COMMA then ,COMMA are we not pumping our fists into the air ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
But for the first time in history ,COMMA we have the technology ;SEMICOLON we have the know-how ;SEMICOLON we have the cash ;SEMICOLON we have the life-saving drugs .PERIOD <BREAK>
The Clash wore big army boots ,COMMA not sandals .PERIOD <BREAK>
But some of them they haven't .PERIOD <BREAK>
Not only in lives saved ,COMMA but in goodwill ,COMMA stability and security that we'll gain .PERIOD <BREAK>
What I hope is that beyond individual merciful acts ,COMMA that you will tell the politicians to do right by Africa ,COMMA by America and by the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
Give us that kind of dreaming ,COMMA that kind of doing .PERIOD <BREAK>
The war against terror ,COMMA yes .PERIOD <BREAK>
Actually we're talking to ABC today about the Oscars .PERIOD <BREAK>
We need to get the math ;SEMICOLON we need to get the statistics out to the American people .PERIOD <BREAK>
One by one they step forward ,COMMA a nurse ,COMMA a teacher ,COMMA a homemaker ,COMMA and lives are saved .PERIOD <BREAK>
We can make history .PERIOD <BREAK>
We can start to make poverty history .PERIOD <BREAK>
The idea that the Internet ,COMMA which changed all of our lives ,COMMA can transform a country -- and a continent that has hardly made it to analog ,COMMA let alone digital -- blows my mind .PERIOD <BREAK>
Communication is very important for Ethiopia -- will transform the country .PERIOD <BREAK>
I am ,COMMA of course ,COMMA referring to none other than Elvis Presley .PERIOD <BREAK>
And love is not love ,COMMA but being all shook up .PERIOD <BREAK>
Does that correspond ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Metaphor creates a kind of conceptual synesthesia ,COMMA in which we understand one concept in the context of another .PERIOD <BREAK>
One of the sentences was ,COMMA Some jobs are jails .PERIOD <BREAK>
And they had those expectations because agent metaphors imply the deliberate action of a living thing pursuing a goal .PERIOD <BREAK>
But there is a better translation .PERIOD <BREAK>
The Latin word cogito is derived from the prefix co ,COMMA meaning together ,COMMA and the verb agitare ,COMMA meaning to shake .PERIOD <BREAK>
And in that sense ,COMMA ballooning is a beautiful metaphor .PERIOD <BREAK>
We want to go in a direction ,COMMA but the winds push us in another direction ,COMMA like in life .PERIOD <BREAK>
And as long as we fight horizontally ,COMMA against life ,COMMA against the winds ,COMMA against what's happening to us ,COMMA life is a nightmare .PERIOD <BREAK>
How do we go from the metaphor to something more practical that we can really use every day ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
It's not true .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is very practical .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is why you need people with long-term vision .PERIOD <BREAK>
But we were expected to have doubts ;SEMICOLON we're expected to have fears .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's to show you how much gas was left in the last bottles .PERIOD <BREAK>
We landed with 40 kilos .PERIOD <BREAK>
I had no idea how it was possible .PERIOD <BREAK>
And when the capsule of my balloon was introduced officially in the Air and Space Museum in Washington ,COMMA together with the airplane of Charles Lindbergh ,COMMA with Apollo 11 ,COMMA with the Wright Brothers' Flyer ,COMMA with Chuck Yeager's 61 ,COMMA I had really a thought then .PERIOD <BREAK>
It will be prohibited because we'll have to save our natural resources in a few decades from now .PERIOD <BREAK>
Which means that they have more proven the limits of renewable energies than the potential of it .PERIOD <BREAK>
The goal is to take off ,COMMA end of this year for the first test ,COMMA but mainly next year ,COMMA spring or summer ,COMMA take off ,COMMA on our own power ,COMMA without additional help ,COMMA without being towed ,COMMA climb to 9000 meters altitude .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA you see that this airplane is more a symbol .PERIOD <BREAK>
I don't think it will transport 200 people in the next years .PERIOD <BREAK>
And 20 years later there were 200 people in every airplane crossing the Atlantic .PERIOD <BREAK>
And each time we have some ice in the future ,COMMA we have to know that life will be great ,COMMA and the success will be brilliant if we dare to overcome our fear of the ice ,COMMA to go through the obstacle ,COMMA to go through the problem ,COMMA in order to see what there is on the other side .PERIOD <BREAK>
I wish I could show you my Yemen .PERIOD <BREAK>
It was very hard ,COMMA you know ,COMMA to impose my authority .PERIOD <BREAK>
But a woman's got to do what a woman's got to do .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's about proving who you are and what you can do .PERIOD <BREAK>
But in assuming this responsibility and going about it as you have ,COMMA you have become a bridge between an older and traditional society and the one that you are now creating at the paper .PERIOD <BREAK>
And this is true .PERIOD <BREAK>
Well the Yemen Times ,COMMA across 20 years ,COMMA has been through so much .PERIOD <BREAK>
They think that if there's anything against them ,COMMA then we are being an opposition newspaper .PERIOD <BREAK>
And very ,COMMA very difficult times .PERIOD <BREAK>
And he ended up writing about a story that even surprised me -- hip hop -- that there are young Yemeni men who express themselves through dancing and puchu puchu .PERIOD <BREAK>
That thing .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'm not so old .PERIOD <BREAK>
Actually ,COMMA that's a documentary that's available online ;SEMICOLON the video's online .PERIOD <BREAK>
And certainly you yourself and what you do have given us a view of the future that we will embrace and be grateful for .PERIOD <BREAK>
On Twitter also .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it doesn't take much time to discover some really astonishing statistics with this issue .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's the number one contaminant of groundwater ,COMMA drinking water ,COMMA rain water .PERIOD <BREAK>
In some cases ,COMMA another species like the North American Leopard Frog showed that males exposed to atrazine grew eggs in their testes .PERIOD <BREAK>
Normally the testes should make testosterone ,COMMA the male hormone .PERIOD <BREAK>
In fact ,COMMA this aromatase is so important in breast cancer that the latest treatment for breast cancer is a chemical called letrozole ,COMMA which blocks aromatase ,COMMA blocks estrogen ,COMMA so that if you developed a mutated cell ,COMMA it doesn't grow into a tumor .PERIOD <BREAK>
PJC :COLON So speaking of estrogen ,COMMA one of the other compounds that Tyrone talks about in the film is something called bisphenol A ,COMMA BPA ,COMMA which has been in the news recently .PERIOD <BREAK>
So we're dosing our babies ,COMMA our newborns ,COMMA our infants ,COMMA with a synthetic estrogen .PERIOD <BREAK>
So the pup you see on the bottom is affected by atrazine that its grandmother was exposed to .PERIOD <BREAK>
And given the life of many of these chemicals ,COMMA generations ,COMMA years ,COMMA dozens of years ,COMMA that means that we right now are affecting the health of our grandchildren's grandchildren by things that we're putting into the environment today .PERIOD <BREAK>
And this was something that was really brought home to me a year ago when I found out I was pregnant and the first scan revealed that my baby had a birth defect associated with exposure to estrogenic chemicals in the womb and the second scan revealed no heartbeat .PERIOD <BREAK>
We know so much about global warming and climate change ,COMMA and yet ,COMMA we have no concept of what I've been calling internal environmentalism .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'm not married ,COMMA but one year ago today ,COMMA I woke up from a month-long coma ,COMMA following a double lung transplant .PERIOD <BREAK>
Crazy ,COMMA I know .PERIOD Insane .PERIOD <BREAK>
But I was not limited when I sang ,COMMA and as air came up from my lungs ,COMMA through my vocal cords and passed my lips as sound ,COMMA it was the closest thing I had ever come to transcendence .PERIOD <BREAK>
My father and my grandfather were always looking for the newest thing in alternative or traditional therapies for PH ,COMMA but after six months ,COMMA I couldn't walk up a small hill .PERIOD I couldn't climb a flight of stairs .PERIOD <BREAK>
Mine was 146 .PERIOD <BREAK>
Doctors insert a catheter into your chest ,COMMA which is attached to a pump that weighs about four-and-a-half pounds .PERIOD <BREAK>
Literally hundreds of elevator rides were spent with me alone stuffing the pump into my Spanx ,COMMA hoping the doors wouldn't open unexpectedly .PERIOD <BREAK>
Against my doctors' and family's wishes ,COMMA I needed to go back for the funeral .PERIOD <BREAK>
I was dying ,COMMA and if I didn't mix that stuff up fast ,COMMA I would never leave that apartment alive .PERIOD <BREAK>
I went back to the States ,COMMA anticipating I'd return to Europe ,COMMA but the heart catheterization showed that I wasn't going anywhere further that a flight-for-life from Johns Hopkins Hospital .PERIOD <BREAK>
A happy patient is a healthy patient .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it was right-heart failure .PERIOD <BREAK>
It was a match .PERIOD <BREAK>
Because ,COMMA despite their problems ,COMMA I had spent my whole life training my lungs ,COMMA and I was not particularly enthusiastic about giving them up .PERIOD <BREAK>
They left my chest open for two weeks .PERIOD <BREAK>
An infection ravaged my skin .PERIOD <BREAK>
If they stayed in ,COMMA there was no way I would ever sing again .PERIOD <BREAK>
There were a dozen tubes coming in and out of my body .PERIOD <BREAK>
I couldn't walk ,COMMA I couldn't talk ,COMMA I couldn't eat ,COMMA I couldn't move ,COMMA I certainly couldn't sing ,COMMA I couldn't even breathe ,COMMA but when I looked up and I saw my mother ,COMMA I couldn't help but smile .PERIOD <BREAK>
Whether by a Mack truck or by heart failure or faulty lungs ,COMMA death happens .PERIOD <BREAK>
But life isn't really just about avoiding death ,COMMA is it ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Life Magazine helped in this effort by announcing the introduction of throwaways that would liberate the housewife from the drudgery of doing dishes .PERIOD <BREAK>
A teacher told me how to express the under-five-percent of plastics recovered in our waste stream .PERIOD <BREAK>
In spite of deposit fees ,COMMA much of this trash leading out to the sea will be plastic beverage bottles .PERIOD <BREAK>
Isla San Roque is an uninhabited bird rookery off Baja's sparsely populated central coast .PERIOD <BREAK>
Notice that the bottles here have caps on them .PERIOD <BREAK>
A four-month old Laysan Albatross chick died with this in its stomach .PERIOD <BREAK>
That day I ended up spending nearly 60 .PERIOD <BREAK>
And this particular beach is Kailua Beach ,COMMA the beach where our president and his family vacationed before moving to Washington .PERIOD <BREAK>
We wanted to see if the most common fish in the deep ocean ,COMMA at the base of the food chain ,COMMA was ingesting these poison pills .PERIOD <BREAK>
But no fishmonger on Earth can sell you a certified organic wild-caught fish .PERIOD <BREAK>
The range of the species goes up to as much as 380 feet tall .PERIOD <BREAK>
I became very interested ,COMMA and I wrote about a couple .PERIOD <BREAK>
His friend ,COMMA a guy named Marwood Harris ,COMMA was following behind .PERIOD <BREAK>
But they made it to the top ,COMMA and what they found was not a Redwood desert ,COMMA but a lost world -- a kind of three-dimensional labyrinth in the air ,COMMA filled with unknown life .PERIOD <BREAK>
Children are incredibly adept at climbing trees .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's my son ,COMMA Oliver .PERIOD <BREAK>
If ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny ,COMMA then children are somewhat closer to our roots as primates in the arboreal forest .PERIOD <BREAK>
You ascend 30 stories .PERIOD <BREAK>
And there's also something that I want to show you .PERIOD <BREAK>
The scientists are doing all kinds of experiments in these trees .PERIOD <BREAK>
We're looking at the very top of Gaya ,COMMA which is thought to be the oldest Redwood .PERIOD <BREAK>
What can the Redwoods tell us about ourselves ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
The flickering ,COMMA transitory quality of human time and the brevity of human life -- the necessity to love .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I think that one of the happiest things is the sense that with my children I've been able to introduce them into the very small circle of humans who are lucky enough ,COMMA or possibly stupid enough ,COMMA to still climb trees .PERIOD <BREAK>
But that's just a very small facet of a much greater problem of invasions of species worldwide ,COMMA all through the ecosystems ,COMMA and you know ,COMMA the Earth itself -- CA :COLON Partly caused by us ,COMMA inadvertently .PERIOD <BREAK>
Thank you .PERIOD <BREAK>
We know because it says so inside the code .PERIOD <BREAK>
And Basit and Amjad are first names ,COMMA Pakistani first names .PERIOD <BREAK>
So half a year ago ,COMMA I decided to go to Pakistan myself .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I knocked on the door .PERIOD <BREAK>
You want to guess who opened the door ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
So let me just run some viruses on my computer .PERIOD <BREAK>
Let me show you one which actually makes some sound .PERIOD <BREAK>
We find guys like Bjorn Sundin ,COMMA originally from Sweden ,COMMA and his partner in crime ,COMMA also listed on the INTERPOL wanted pages ,COMMA Mr .PERIOD Shaileshkumar Jain ,COMMA a US .PERIOD citizen .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA criminals who weren't capable of reaching us before can reach us .PERIOD <BREAK>
But even more interestingly ,COMMA if we continue decrypting ,COMMA we'll find this mysterious string ,COMMA which says O 600 KO 78 RUS .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's not used for anything .PERIOD <BREAK>
I got zero hits ;SEMICOLON wasn't there .PERIOD <BREAK>
So I spoke with the guys at the lab .PERIOD <BREAK>
And on this blog ,COMMA he blogs about his life ,COMMA about his life in St .PERIOD Petersburg -- he's in his early 20 s -- about his cat ,COMMA about his girlfriend .PERIOD <BREAK>
In fact ,COMMA this guy drives a Mercedes-Benz S 600 V 12 with a six-liter engine with more than 400 horsepower .PERIOD <BREAK>
The vast majority of the online crime cases ,COMMA we don't even know which continent the attacks are coming from .PERIOD <BREAK>
PLC's ,COMMA these small boxes which have no display ,COMMA no keyboard ,COMMA which are programmed ,COMMA are put in place ,COMMA and they do their job .PERIOD <BREAK>
You go to any factory ,COMMA any power plant ,COMMA any chemical plant ,COMMA any food processing plant ,COMMA you look around -- everything is being run by computers .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'm worried that we are running into problems because of online crime .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'm not engaged in predicting random number generators .PERIOD <BREAK>
I don't have a clue .PERIOD <BREAK>
Mother Theresa ,COMMA she was rational .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA we have to work out who influences problems .PERIOD <BREAK>
There are lots of people shaping decisions and so if we want to predict correctly we have to pay attention to everybody who is trying to shape the outcome ,COMMA not just the people at the pinnacle of the decision-making pyramid .PERIOD <BREAK>
So with just that little bit of input we can work out what the choices are that people have ,COMMA what the chances are that they're willing to take ,COMMA what they're after ,COMMA what they value ,COMMA what they want ,COMMA and what they believe about other people .PERIOD <BREAK>
I remind you of that 90 percent accuracy rate .PERIOD <BREAK>
What's its future ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Over here you can see this is the distribution of power in favor of civilian nuclear energy today ,COMMA this is what that power block is predicted to be like by the late parts of 2010 ,COMMA early parts of 2011 .PERIOD <BREAK>
That power disappears completely ;SEMICOLON nobody supports that by 2011 .PERIOD <BREAK>
Here is Mr .PERIOD Ahmadinejad .PERIOD <BREAK>
He is on the way down .PERIOD <BREAK>
Everything is not predictable :COLON the stock market is ,COMMA at least for me ,COMMA not predictable ,COMMA but most complicated negotiations are predictable .PERIOD <BREAK>

So ,COMMA I've had an obsession basically for 30 years ,COMMA and that obsession has been ,COMMA What makes the difference in the quality of peoples lives ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Whether it be your business ,COMMA your contribution to society ,COMMA money -- whatever it is for you -- your body ,COMMA your family .PERIOD <BREAK>
But the other lesson of life that is rarely mastered is the art of fulfillment .PERIOD <BREAK>
Because science is easy ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And everybody in this room -- you wouldn't be in this room if you bought that theory -- but the -- most of society thinks biography is destiny .PERIOD <BREAK>
Audience :COLON Aye .PERIOD <BREAK>
Al Gore :COLON Supreme Court .PERIOD <BREAK>
If you don't have the money ,COMMA but you're creative and determined enough ,COMMA you find the way .PERIOD So this is the ultimate resource .PERIOD <BREAK>
In this second ,COMMA consciously or unconsciously ,COMMA the minute you decide to focus on something you've got to give it a meaning ,COMMA and whatever that meaning is produces emotion .PERIOD <BREAK>
Honestly ,COMMA better or worse ?QUESTIONMARK Say ,COMMA Aye .PERIOD <BREAK>
How would their lives be different ?QUESTIONMARK Their impact ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Audience :COLON Aye .PERIOD <BREAK>
Let me tell you what they are .PERIOD First one :COLON certainty .PERIOD <BREAK>
So that's why violence has always been around and will be around unless we have a consciousness change as a species .PERIOD <BREAK>
I said ,COMMA Focus on :COLON 'there's food' -- what a concept ,COMMA you know .PERIOD <BREAK>
Second -- but this is what changed my life ,COMMA this is what shaped me as a human being -- Somebody's gift .PERIOD <BREAK>
10 seconds ,COMMA that's all .PERIOD I want to be respectful .PERIOD 10 seconds .PERIOD <BREAK>
If you saw these women on the street in their faded clothes ,COMMA you might dismiss them as poor and simple .PERIOD <BREAK>
We will not be there .PERIOD <BREAK>
Mau is a palu ,COMMA a navigator priest .PERIOD <BREAK>
Their tradition is so extraordinary that these mariners sailed three million square miles across the Pacific without the use of instruments .PERIOD <BREAK>
The palu also had an uncanny ability to forecast weather conditions days in advance .PERIOD <BREAK>
Their achievements ,COMMA intellectually and scientifically ,COMMA are extraordinary ,COMMA and they are so relevant for these times that we are in when we are riding out storms .PERIOD <BREAK>
We cannot afford to lose it .PERIOD <BREAK>
The link between the past and the future is fragile .PERIOD <BREAK>
I am haunted by the fact that I no longer remember the names of the winds and the rains .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I am reminded that throughout the world there are cultures with vast sums of knowledge in them ,COMMA as potent as the Micronesian navigators ,COMMA that are going dismissed ,COMMA that this is a testament to brilliant ,COMMA brilliant technology and science and wisdom that is vanishing rapidly .PERIOD <BREAK>
YouTube cares deeply about the rights of content owners ,COMMA but in order to give them choices about what they can do with copies ,COMMA mashups and more ,COMMA we need to first identify when copyrighted material is uploaded to our site .PERIOD <BREAK>
Because Sony Music had registered Chris Brown's video in our Content ID system ,COMMA within seconds of attempting to upload the video ,COMMA the copy was detected ,COMMA giving Sony the choice of what to do next .PERIOD <BREAK>
The video's inspired over 26000 dollars in donations to end domestic violence .PERIOD <BREAK>
So why has no one ever solved this problem before ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
But it's not just about dollars and impressions .PERIOD <BREAK>
♫ Billie crept softly ♫ ♫ into my waking arms ♫ ♫ warm like a sip of sour mash ♫ ♫ Strange fruit for ♫ ♫ a sweet hunk of trash ♫ ♫ Panic at the stage door ♫ ♫ of Carnegie Hall ♫ ♫ Famous Jazz Singer Gone AWOL ♫ ♫ Must have left the building ♫ ♫ body and soul ♫ ♫ On a creaky ♫ ♫ piano stool tonight ♫ ♫ as the moon is my ♫ ♫ only witness ♫ ♫ She was breathing ♫ ♫ in my ear ♫ ♫ This time it's love ♫ ♫ But love is a loaded pistol ♫ ♫ By daybreak she's gone ♫ ♫ Over the frozen river ,COMMA home ♫ ♫ Me and Johnny Walker ♫ ♫ See in the new age ♫ ♫ alone ♫ ♫ Stay with me ♫ ♫ again tonight ♫ ♫ Billie ,COMMA time ,COMMA ♫ ♫ time is a wily trickster ♫ ♫ Still an echo ♫ ♫ in my heart says ,COMMA ♫ ♫ This time it's love ♫ So I really consider myself a storyteller .PERIOD <BREAK>
Since the dawn of human history ,COMMA we've tried to rectify this imbalance by making art ,COMMA writing poems ,COMMA singing songs ,COMMA scripting editorials and sending them in to a newspaper ,COMMA gossiping with friends .PERIOD This is nothing new .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's been running for about a year and a half .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I'll show you a glimpse of how this information is then visualized .PERIOD So this is We Feel Fine .PERIOD <BREAK>
The dots exhibit human qualities .PERIOD They kind of have their own physics ,COMMA and they swarm wildly around ,COMMA kind of exploring the world of life .PERIOD <BREAK>
And then they also exhibit curiosity .PERIOD <BREAK>
There's also Murmurs ,COMMA Montage ,COMMA Mobs ,COMMA Metrics and Mounds .PERIOD <BREAK>
And then ,COMMA one by one ,COMMA in reverse chronological order ,COMMA they excuse themselves ,COMMA entering the scrolling list of feelings .PERIOD <BREAK>
I feel invisible to you .PERIOD <BREAK>
I feel in love with Carolyn .PERIOD I feel so naughty .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is in response to ,COMMA What's beautiful ?QUESTIONMARK Miss World .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it caused me to wonder about our world today .PERIOD <BREAK>
And those are the questions that inspired my new project ,COMMA which is debuting here today at TED .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's called Universe :COLON Revealing Our Modern Mythology .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is the universe of 2007 ,COMMA the last two months .PERIOD <BREAK>
But we can actually be more specific in defining our universe .PERIOD <BREAK>
So we see Obama and the Clintons meet in Alabama .PERIOD <BREAK>
You can see that this is an important story ;SEMICOLON there are a lot of things in its orbit .PERIOD If we open this up ,COMMA we get different perspectives on this story .PERIOD <BREAK>
And you'll all be able to use it and kind of explore what your own personal mythology might be .PERIOD <BREAK>
As you search for the things that are important to you in your world ,COMMA and then see what the constellations of those might look like .PERIOD <BREAK>
We're facing this problem .PERIOD <BREAK>
There is the problem .PERIOD <BREAK>
And you know ,COMMA going back maybe 10 years in time when I got the funding to buy my first graphics computer -- it was a huge machine .PERIOD <BREAK>
It was cabinets of processors and storage and everything .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is a data set that was captured using a CT scanner .PERIOD <BREAK>
And of course all the data is inside ,COMMA so I can start rotating ,COMMA I can look at it from different angles ,COMMA and I can see that this woman had a problem .PERIOD <BREAK>
And one of the applications that we've been working on -- and this has gotten a little bit of traction worldwide -- is the application of virtual autopsies .PERIOD <BREAK>
So this is from a virtual autopsy .PERIOD <BREAK>
The person was killed by stabs in the heart ,COMMA but they just deposited the knife by putting it through one of the eyeballs .PERIOD <BREAK>
Here's another case that I think is interesting .PERIOD <BREAK>
During a physical autopsy ,COMMA if you actually have to dig through the body to find these fragments ,COMMA that's actually quite hard to do .PERIOD <BREAK>
So if you have the opportunity ,COMMA please try it out .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's really a hands-on experience .PERIOD <BREAK>
And this is a bit of science fiction now ,COMMA so we're moving into really the future .PERIOD <BREAK>
And he's also hearing our instructions when we tell him to do things .PERIOD <BREAK>
And in just a second here you will see -- okay ,COMMA here .PERIOD Motts ,COMMA now move your left foot .PERIOD <BREAK>
I can look inside of it .PERIOD <BREAK>
And here it is .PERIOD Here is the nose of the bear .PERIOD <BREAK>
Well ,COMMA 80 percent of the men in Lesotho worked in the mines over the border ,COMMA in brutal conditions .PERIOD <BREAK>
He was the son of one of the poorest families in the village .PERIOD <BREAK>
Perhaps the universe existed before the bang ,COMMA and the bang was just a violent event in a pre-existing universe .PERIOD <BREAK>
I won't go into the details of why we think the universe is like this ,COMMA but it comes out of the math and trying to explain the physics that we know .PERIOD <BREAK>
And there've been bangs in the past ,COMMA and there will be bangs in the future .PERIOD <BREAK>
What about Africa ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
It's still going on .PERIOD <BREAK>
What about Africa's capacity to do something about these problems ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Well ,COMMA here's the number of physicians in Africa .PERIOD <BREAK>
And while I was busy working -- I was working on these colliding worlds ,COMMA in the day .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we got lots of applicants .PERIOD <BREAK>
You have to rethink ,COMMA what is the university for ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
No droning on at the chalkboard .PERIOD <BREAK>
Everyone lives together in this hotel -- lecturers and students -- and it's not surprising at all to find an impromptu tutorial at 1 am .PERIOD <BREAK>
We especially emphasize areas of great relevance to Africa's development ,COMMA because ,COMMA in those areas ,COMMA scientists working in Africa will have a competitive advantage .PERIOD <BREAK>
They'll publish ,COMMA be invited to conferences .PERIOD <BREAK>
And AIMS has done extremely well .PERIOD <BREAK>
Five students can be educated at AIMS for the cost of educating one in the US .PERIOD or Europe .PERIOD <BREAK>
She communicates well with the immunologists at the hospital .PERIOD <BREAK>
Here are the current students at AIMS .PERIOD There are 53 of them from 20 different countries ,COMMA including 20 women .PERIOD <BREAK>
So now I'm going to get to my TED business .PERIOD <BREAK>
I want to point out a few other exceptional people in this picture .PERIOD <BREAK>
And she's now at AIMS .PERIOD <BREAK>
And our wish has two parts :COLON one is a dream and the other's a plan .PERIOD OK .PERIOD <BREAK>
Our TED dream is that the next Einstein will be African .PERIOD <BREAK>
We want to add entrepreneurship and policy skills .PERIOD <BREAK>
Over the last year ,COMMA we've been visiting sites in Africa ,COMMA looking at potential sites for new AIMS centers .PERIOD <BREAK>
So we have political support right across the continent .PERIOD <BREAK>
But nobody was really worried about this .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is a quote ,COMMA actually ,COMMA from Alan Turing :COLON In 30 years ,COMMA it will be as easy to ask a computer a question as to ask a person .PERIOD <BREAK>
This was in 1946 .PERIOD And now ,COMMA in 2007 ,COMMA it's still not true .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's how much power this computer uses .PERIOD <BREAK>
Rory is a graduate student at Stanford .PERIOD <BREAK>
I estimate 10 to the 16 bits per second ,COMMA which is actually about very similar to what Blue Gene does .PERIOD <BREAK>
And let me just summarize .PERIOD So the bottom line :COLON the brain processes information using 100000 times less energy than we do right now with this computer technology that we have .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA this clip is from the PBS series ,COMMA The Secret Life of the Brain .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that's basically what's going on in your brain right now as you're watching this .PERIOD <BREAK>
The devices that computers use are what's called a transistor .PERIOD <BREAK>
Your computer uses this presence of current to represent a one ,COMMA and the absence of current to represent a zero .PERIOD <BREAK>
But ,COMMA when it's open ,COMMA because these ions have to line up and flow through ,COMMA one at a time ,COMMA you get a kind of sporadic ,COMMA not steady -- it's a sporadic flow of current .PERIOD <BREAK>
In fact ,COMMA there's about 12 electrons can all be flowing this way .PERIOD <BREAK>
What you see here is that there's these redundant connections .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is Kareem's dark eyes and that's the white background that you see here .PERIOD <BREAK>
So we are really duplicating the kind of signals that you have on the optic nerve .PERIOD <BREAK>
Let me just end by saying that this is what happens when you put Africa in a piano ,COMMA OK .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I had this gut reaction that this was the wrong way to do it .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'm interested in finding whether or not there is a really massive ,COMMA what we like to call supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy .PERIOD <BREAK>
But today ,COMMA the way I want you to understand a black hole ,COMMA for the proof of a black hole ,COMMA is to think of it as an object whose mass is confined to zero volume .PERIOD <BREAK>
So why is it so important ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA the key here is to figure out what that Schwarzschild radius is .PERIOD <BREAK>
It depends only on the mass of the object .PERIOD <BREAK>
There are big ones .PERIOD There are little ones .PERIOD <BREAK>
And there are a hundred billion stars in that galaxy ,COMMA just to give you a sense of scale .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA at the center there ,COMMA that's actually where most of the starlight comes out from .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA you can't see the black hole itself ,COMMA but you can convert the gravitational energy of the black hole into the light we see .PERIOD <BREAK>
And if there is a supermassive black hole ,COMMA what we need to assume is that it's a black hole on a diet .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we live in the middle of it ,COMMA so when we look towards the center ,COMMA we see this plane which defines the plane of the galaxy ,COMMA or line that defines the plane of the galaxy .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's the gravitational pull that makes these things orbit .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA this is great ,COMMA because remember my job is to show there is a lot of mass inside a small volume .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA I want to see the stars that are as close to the center of the galaxy as possible .PERIOD <BREAK>
Because I want to show there is a mass inside as small a region as possible .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that buys us about a factor of 20 .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA without this technology you can't see the stars .PERIOD <BREAK>
And this one ,COMMA this one goes around in a human lifetime .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the truth is ,COMMA I'm not quite there .PERIOD <BREAK>
But we actually have no alternative today to explaining this concentration of mass .PERIOD <BREAK>
Likewise ,COMMA for the young stars ,COMMA or in contrast ,COMMA the young stars ,COMMA they just should not be there .PERIOD <BREAK>
Using observations that are not the ones I've shown you today ,COMMA we can actually figure out which ones are old and which ones are young .PERIOD <BREAK>
The old ones are red .PERIOD <BREAK>
He didn't read a note ,COMMA and he was profoundly hearing impaired .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the thing about classical music ,COMMA that what and how ,COMMA it's inexhaustible .PERIOD <BREAK>
And a tough ,COMMA slouchy kid got up to bat ,COMMA and he took a swing and really connected .PERIOD <BREAK>
Brah dada dadadadah .PERIOD <BREAK>
And whether we call them 440 per second ,COMMA A ,COMMA or 3729 ,COMMA B flat -- trust me ,COMMA that's right -- they're just phenomena .PERIOD <BREAK>
And in the 17 th century ,COMMA it was more like this .PERIOD <BREAK>
And there began to be a real difference at this point between the art of improvisation and the art of composition .PERIOD <BREAK>
So in the first eight centuries or so of this tradition the big 'what' was to praise God .PERIOD <BREAK>
The 'how' was a style called polyphony ,COMMA music of many independently moving voices that suggested the way the planets seemed to move in Ptolemy's geocentric universe .PERIOD <BREAK>
Ah ,COMMA avaricious heaven !EXCLAMATIONMARK <BREAK>
And the chords ,COMMA it turned out ,COMMA were capable of representing incredible varieties of emotions .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's just these two notes in the middle .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it turned out the symphony could be used for more complex issues ,COMMA like gripping ones of culture ,COMMA such as nationalism or quest for freedom or the frontiers of sensuality .PERIOD <BREAK>
What happens when the music stops ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Where does it go ?QUESTIONMARK What's left ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
It's the passing on part .PERIOD It's the 'why' part of it .PERIOD <BREAK>
At the same time technology ,COMMA by taking over the role that notation had always played ,COMMA shifted the balance within music between instinct and intelligence way over to the instinctive side .PERIOD <BREAK>
What's the long-term effect of this on us or on music ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Nobody knows .PERIOD <BREAK>
There's just a role here for so many people -- teachers ,COMMA parents ,COMMA performers -- to be explorers together .PERIOD <BREAK>
You can start anywhere .PERIOD Ramble a bit .PERIOD <BREAK>
Then these two fellows came along ,COMMA and they were flying kites to develop the control systems that would ultimately enable powered human flight .PERIOD <BREAK>
But unfortunately ,COMMA it relegated kites once again to be considered children's toys .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it doesn't hurt to do it in a location like this either .PERIOD <BREAK>
If you'd loan me your Gulfstream ,COMMA I'll rip its wings off and generate you a megawatt .PERIOD <BREAK>
The story starts with just a single person ,COMMA a child ,COMMA behaving a little strangely .PERIOD <BREAK>
They're creating the ecosystem from which innovation emerges .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's based on hundreds of hours of research ,COMMA of practice .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA here's an example -- pre-Internet -- of this machine in action .PERIOD <BREAK>
I mean ,COMMA you might just be a kid with a webcam ,COMMA but if you can do something that goes viral ,COMMA you get to be seen by the equivalent of sports stadiums crammed with people .PERIOD <BREAK>
And even if it's not that eloquent -- and it's not -- it can still really make your day .PERIOD <BREAK>
In fact ,COMMA my colleague ,COMMA June Cohen ,COMMA has taken to calling it radical openness ,COMMA because it works for us each time .PERIOD <BREAK>
By giving away our TEDx brand ,COMMA we suddenly have a thousand-plus live experiments in the art of spreading ideas .PERIOD <BREAK>
We're a social species .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that's why what I'm excited about ,COMMA and what I think is under-reported ,COMMA is the significance of the rise of online video .PERIOD <BREAK>
He's a unicyclist .PERIOD <BREAK>
Jove is a website that was founded to encourage scientists to publish their peer-reviewed research on video .PERIOD <BREAK>
Why do people like watching TEDTalks ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
500 years ago ,COMMA it ran into a competitor with a lethal advantage .PERIOD <BREAK>
I mean ,COMMA today ,COMMA one person speaking can be seen by millions ,COMMA shedding bright light on potent ideas ,COMMA creating intense desire for learning and to respond -- and in his case ,COMMA intense desire to laugh .PERIOD <BREAK>
Thousands of people are figuring out new ways to learn and ,COMMA crucially ,COMMA to respond ,COMMA completing the cycle .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so ,COMMA as we've thought about this ,COMMA you know ,COMMA it's become clear to us what the next stage of TED's evolution has to be .PERIOD <BREAK>
They used the same trash to form green manure .PERIOD <BREAK>
Thank you .PERIOD <BREAK>
The name Abegg -- Abegg is actually A-B-E-G-G ,COMMA and that's the main theme in the melody .PERIOD <BREAK>
What I do first is ,COMMA I make a lot of little musical ideas -- you can just improvise here at the piano -- and I choose one of those to become my main theme ,COMMA my main melody ,COMMA like the Abegg that you just heard .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA for inspiration I listened to Liszt and Tchaikovsky and all the great Romantic composers .PERIOD <BREAK>
And once I realized it ,COMMA there's a parallel between creating music and creating art ,COMMA because for your motive or your little initial idea for your drawing ,COMMA it's your character -- you want to decide who do you want to draw ,COMMA or if you want to draw an original character .PERIOD <BREAK>
Like ,COMMA am I going to use one page ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Am I going to use a two-page spread like a comic book for more grandiose effect ,COMMA I guess ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Instead ,COMMA I'd like to try something called improvisation .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that's a huge amount of data .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the more technical topics ,COMMA such as architecture ,COMMA materials and ,COMMA strangely enough ,COMMA men ,COMMA those are not good topics to talk about .PERIOD <BREAK>
Ingenious TEDTalks ,COMMA much more this green color ,COMMA etc ,COMMA et .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA since this is TEDActive ,COMMA and I learned from my analysis that I should actually give you something ,COMMA I will not impose the ultimate or worst TEDTalk on you ,COMMA but rather give you a tool to create your own .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I call this tool the TEDPad .PERIOD <BREAK>
Thank you very much .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA if you combine this very simple ,COMMA very conservative thought -- go with the grain of human nature -- with all the advances in behavioral economics ,COMMA some of which we were just hearing about ,COMMA again ,COMMA I think we can achieve a real increase in well-being ,COMMA in happiness ,COMMA in a stronger society without necessarily having to spend a whole lot more money .PERIOD <BREAK>
Well I can't ,COMMA in the time I've got ,COMMA give huge numbers of examples ,COMMA but let me just give a few of the ways that life can change .PERIOD <BREAK>
And this is so obvious ,COMMA in a way ,COMMA because you think about how all of you have changed the way we shop ,COMMA the way we travel ,COMMA the way that business is done .PERIOD <BREAK>
We want to get people to be more energy efficient .PERIOD <BREAK>
Obviously ,COMMA here we have JFK with that incredibly simple and powerful formulation ,COMMA Ask not what your country can do for you ;SEMICOLON ask what you can do for your country ,COMMA an incredibly noble sentiment .PERIOD <BREAK>
But when he made that speech ,COMMA what could you do to build the stronger ,COMMA better society ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And I think an even more wonderful speech ,COMMA which I'm going to read a big chunk of ,COMMA which sums up what I said at the beginning about believing there is more to life than money ,COMMA and more that we should try and measure than money .PERIOD <BREAK>
Some say up to five tons .PERIOD <BREAK>
They're fantastic creatures .PERIOD <BREAK>
So they were incredibly important animals .PERIOD <BREAK>
The importance of basking sharks to the coast communities is recognized through the language .PERIOD <BREAK>
And most of what we do know is based on their habit of coming to the surface .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we try to guess what they're doing from their behavior on the surface .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we tagged them very simply ,COMMA not very hi-tech ,COMMA with a big ,COMMA long pole .PERIOD <BREAK>
And of course ,COMMA sharks ,COMMA fish ,COMMA are underwater most of the time .PERIOD <BREAK>
And here's a couple of maps that we've done .PERIOD <BREAK>
That one ,COMMA you can see that we tagged both off Kerry .PERIOD <BREAK>
So he did another study using microsatellites ,COMMA which are much more expensive ,COMMA much more time consuming ,COMMA and ,COMMA to his surprise ,COMMA came up with almost identical results .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it's thought maybe it was a bottleneck ,COMMA a genetic bottleneck thought to be 12000 years ago ,COMMA and this has caused a very low diversity .PERIOD <BREAK>
But the average of all these studies came out -- the mean is about 5000 ,COMMA which I personally don't believe ,COMMA but then I am a skeptic .PERIOD <BREAK>
In fact ,COMMA of those 20000 ,COMMA 8000 were thought to be females .PERIOD <BREAK>
They didn't get enough samples to really explore the genetics in enough detail .PERIOD <BREAK>
And some are caught in nets ,COMMA in trawls .PERIOD <BREAK>
And in about half an hour ,COMMA we got five samples ,COMMA five individual sharks ,COMMA were sampled using Simon's shark slime sampling system .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I was thinking of humpback whales breaching and dolphins .PERIOD <BREAK>
And what you're trying to look at is the males have claspers ,COMMA which kind of dangle out behind the back of the shark .PERIOD <BREAK>
And you just want to learn as much as you can as soon as you can .PERIOD <BREAK>
Philosophers ,COMMA dramatists ,COMMA theologians have grappled with this question for centuries :COLON what makes people go wrong ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
So when I read Robert Louis Stevenson ,COMMA that wasn't fiction .PERIOD <BREAK>
And apparently ,COMMA he disobeyed God ,COMMA and that's the ultimate disobedience to authority .PERIOD <BREAK>
I became an expert witness for one of the guards ,COMMA Sergeant Chip Frederick ,COMMA and in that position ,COMMA I had access to the dozen investigative reports .PERIOD <BREAK>
I had access to him .PERIOD I could study him ,COMMA have him come to my home ,COMMA get to know him ,COMMA do psychological analysis to see ,COMMA was he a good apple or bad apple .PERIOD <BREAK>
Why ?QUESTIONMARK Tier 1 -A was the center for military intelligence .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's one of the visual illustrations of evil .PERIOD <BREAK>
Who are the bad apples ?QUESTIONMARK Well ,COMMA that's a bad question .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so we're interested in ,COMMA what are the external factors around the individual -- the bad barrel ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And social scientists stop there ,COMMA and they miss the big point that I discovered when I became an expert witness for Abu Ghraib .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is Stanley Milgram ,COMMA little Jewish kid from the Bronx ,COMMA and he asked the question ,COMMA Could the Holocaust happen here ,COMMA now ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
He gets tied up to the shock apparatus in another room .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so ,COMMA he's the modern Lucifer effect ,COMMA a man of God who becomes the Angel of Death .PERIOD <BREAK>
It was a real cop car ,COMMA it was a real policeman ,COMMA and there were real neighbors in the street ,COMMA who didn't know that this was an experiment .PERIOD <BREAK>
Do they kill ,COMMA torture ,COMMA mutilate ?QUESTIONMARK 13 .PERIOD <BREAK>
If you give people power without oversight ,COMMA it's a prescription for abuse .PERIOD They knew that ,COMMA and let that happen .PERIOD <BREAK>
The answer is nobody ,COMMA and ,COMMA I think ,COMMA nobody on purpose .PERIOD <BREAK>
Banality of heroism is ,COMMA it's ordinary people who do heroic deeds .PERIOD <BREAK>
He was a low-level private ,COMMA and that stopped it .PERIOD Was he a hero ?QUESTIONMARK No .PERIOD <BREAK>
She came down ,COMMA saw that madhouse and said ,COMMA You know what ,COMMA it's terrible what you're doing to those boys .PERIOD <BREAK>
So the psychology of heroism is -- we're going to end in a moment -- how do we encourage children in new hero courses ,COMMA that I'm working with Matt Langdon -- he has a hero workshop -- to develop this heroic imagination ,COMMA this self-labeling ,COMMA I am a hero in waiting ,COMMA and teach them skills .PERIOD <BREAK>
Wesley and the guy -- 20 and a half inches height .PERIOD <BREAK>
A half an inch would have taken his head off .PERIOD <BREAK>
Take path one ,COMMA you're going to be a perpetrator of evil .PERIOD <BREAK>
Path two ,COMMA you become guilty of the evil of passive inaction .PERIOD <BREAK>
We should ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA because without having this possibility of conscious minds ,COMMA we would have no knowledge whatsoever about our humanity ;SEMICOLON we would have no knowledge whatsoever about the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
So much for the wonder ,COMMA now for the mystery .PERIOD <BREAK>
And in that image there ,COMMA you see a variety of islands of what I call image-making regions in the brain .PERIOD <BREAK>
You have the green for example ,COMMA that corresponds to tactile information ,COMMA or the blue that corresponds to auditory information .PERIOD <BREAK>
But what about the self ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And for a long time ,COMMA people did not even want to touch it ,COMMA because they'd say ,COMMA How can you have this reference point ,COMMA this stability ,COMMA that is required to maintain the continuity of selves day after day ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
I like to call it an almost infinite sameness from day to day .PERIOD <BREAK>
There is the brain stem in between the cerebral cortex and the spinal cord .PERIOD <BREAK>
It developed in collectives of human beings .PERIOD <BREAK>
Why care if it is the brain stem or the cerebral cortex and how this is made ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And if we are interested ,COMMA for example ,COMMA in the fact that anti-gravity is pulling galaxies away from the Earth ,COMMA why should we not be interested in what is going on inside of human beings ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
When I was just a little girl ,COMMA my mom started what is now the longest-running women's film festival in the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
Fishnet stockings .PERIOD <BREAK>
I thought they were really hot .PERIOD <BREAK>
There are lots of very modern political movements that have caught fire in no small part because of cultural hipness .PERIOD <BREAK>
And one of our biggest successes is we get mail from teenage girls in the middle of Iowa who say ,COMMA I Googled Jessica Simpson and stumbled on your site .PERIOD <BREAK>
We don't want one face .PERIOD <BREAK>
Thank you .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's enough to make you feel very overwhelmed .PERIOD <BREAK>
Which brings me to my third paradox .PERIOD <BREAK>
You may have guessed by now ,COMMA I did not light myself on fire .PERIOD <BREAK>
Cornel West says ,COMMA Of course it's a failure .PERIOD <BREAK>
She was talking about board meetings ,COMMA she was founding peace organizations ,COMMA she was coordinating carpools ,COMMA she was consoling friends -- all these daily acts of care and creativity .PERIOD <BREAK>
And surely ,COMMA at three and four years old ,COMMA I was listening to the soothing sound of her voice ,COMMA but I think I was also getting my first lesson in activist work .PERIOD <BREAK>
Know thyself .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we feel like we have to get far ,COMMA far away to a secluded retreat ,COMMA leaving it all behind .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is the term that armies use when they've lost a battle .PERIOD <BREAK>
You may or may not have noticed that I'm wearing a tiny electrode on my forehead .PERIOD <BREAK>
Let me show you what it looks like .PERIOD <BREAK>
Or what if I can take that information and put it into an organic shape up on the screen ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
I may also be interested in knowing how focused I am ,COMMA so I can put my level of attention into the circuit board on the other side .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that was responsiveness .PERIOD <BREAK>
We then realized that if technology could know something about you and use it to help you ,COMMA there's an even more valuable application than that .PERIOD <BREAK>
In the original Zen Bound game ,COMMA you play it by scrolling your fingers over the pad .PERIOD <BREAK>
You have graphs and charts that tell you how your brain was doing -- not just how much rope you used or what your high score is ,COMMA but what was going on inside of your mind .PERIOD <BREAK>
The way these children will be able to use their new awareness to improve themselves will upend many of the damaging and widespread social stigmas that people who are diagnosed as different are challenged with .PERIOD <BREAK>
Thank you .PERIOD <BREAK>
So I used to get my eyes tested just for fun .PERIOD <BREAK>
So let me just tell you ,COMMA the great part of all of this ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And so when I heard that eye specialist tell me all the things ,COMMA a big fat no ,COMMA everybody imagines I was devastated .PERIOD <BREAK>
The first thing I thought about was my mom ,COMMA who was crying over beside me .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that wind in my face made me believe that he was mad and I would drive .PERIOD <BREAK>
Oh ,COMMA for the love of God .PERIOD <BREAK>
I just was so -- how do I tell him ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And then he said to me ,COMMA What did you want to be when you were little ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
I know this run so well ,COMMA by the back of my hand .PERIOD <BREAK>
I count the steps and the lampposts and all those things that visually impaired people have a tendency to have a lot of meetings with .PERIOD <BREAK>
And you know ,COMMA the extraordinary part of it is I just simply had no answers .PERIOD <BREAK>
And nobody can tell me no .PERIOD <BREAK>
Yes ,COMMA you can say I can't be an archeologist .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'm going to go across India on the back of an elephant .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I never thought about noes anymore ,COMMA or not seeing ,COMMA or any of that kind of nothing .PERIOD <BREAK>
And consequently ,COMMA we can see the result all around us .PERIOD <BREAK>
I hope it's not the curb cut between the Chuck E .PERIOD Cheese and the Target store because that's not good enough for Americans to be spilling their blood for .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is the other side of the building .PERIOD <BREAK>
And what is the message that is coming ,COMMA what are the vocabularies and grammars that are coming ,COMMA from this building and how is it informing us about who we are ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
You know ,COMMA this is a building designed like a DVD player .PERIOD <BREAK>
Anyway ,COMMA this is how you compose and assemble a downtown business building ,COMMA and this is what happened when in Glens Falls ,COMMA New York ,COMMA when we tried to do it again ,COMMA where it was missing ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And that starts to be delivered in the form of the railroad suburb :COLON the country villa along the railroad line ,COMMA which allows people to enjoy the amenity of the city ,COMMA but to return to the countryside every night .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that's the great non-articulated agony of suburbia and one of the reasons that it lends itself to ridicule .PERIOD <BREAK>
I don't have any eyes on the side of my head .PERIOD I can't see .PERIOD <BREAK>
So they take the first one that comes along ,COMMA often .PERIOD <BREAK>
We're going to have to do something else instead .PERIOD <BREAK>
So that ,COMMA you know ,COMMA the residences make sense deployed in relation to the places of business ,COMMA of culture and of governance .PERIOD <BREAK>
The dead malls :COLON what are we going to do with them ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
No amount or combination of alternative fuels is going to allow us to continue running what we're running ,COMMA the way we're running it .PERIOD <BREAK>
We're going to have to do everything very differently .PERIOD <BREAK>
And America's not prepared .PERIOD <BREAK>
And within that context ,COMMA we can offer the kids time -- something that seems in short supply in their over-scheduled lives .PERIOD <BREAK>
All materials are available for use .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's a great honor today to share with you The Digital Universe ,COMMA which was created for humanity to really see where we are in the universe .PERIOD <BREAK>
NASA supported this work 12 years ago as part of the rebuilding of the Hayden Planetarium so that we would share this with the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
I captured this live from my laptop in a cafe called Earth Matters on the Lower East Side of Manhattan ,COMMA where I live ,COMMA and it was done as a collaborative project with the Rubin Museum of Himalayan Art for an exhibit on comparative cosmology .PERIOD <BREAK>
But this our containment of the visible universe .PERIOD <BREAK>
This map can be updated ,COMMA and we can add in new data .PERIOD <BREAK>
We have a growing user base of this ,COMMA and we network domes .PERIOD <BREAK>
So you're seeing the edge of the Earth .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is Nepal and Tibet .PERIOD <BREAK>
Thank you .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA he figures out a way to download himself into his environment ,COMMA actually into a series of books .PERIOD <BREAK>
I think that this is the future of interface ,COMMA it's the future of music ,COMMA the future of instruments .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I'll let Adam tell you .PERIOD So ,COMMA Adam is a PhD .PERIOD student at MIT ,COMMA an expert in music technology and medicine .PERIOD And Adam and Dan have become close collaborators .PERIOD <BREAK>
Adam Boulanger :COLON Yes .PERIOD So ,COMMA Tod and I entered into a discussion following the Tewksbury work and it was really about how Dan is an expressive person ,COMMA and he's an intelligent and creative person .PERIOD And it's in his face ,COMMA it's in his breathing ,COMMA it's in his eyes .PERIOD How come he can't perform one of his pieces of music ?QUESTIONMARK That's our responsibility ,COMMA and it doesn't make sense .PERIOD <BREAK>
But what about expression ?QUESTIONMARK What about that moment when an artist delivers that piece of work ?QUESTIONMARK You know ,COMMA do our technologies allow us to express ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
So let's do it .PERIOD So Dan do you want to tell everyone about what you're going to play now ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
So he can go in Hyperscore .PERIOD You start out by making melodies and rhythms .PERIOD <BREAK>
He can place those exactly where he wants .PERIOD <BREAK>
But instead of making it very literal ,COMMA showing you exactly the camera tracing ,COMMA we turned it into a graphic that shows you the basic movement ,COMMA and shows the way it's being analyzed .PERIOD <BREAK>
Yeah .PERIOD <BREAK>
And these women sing an enchanting song ,COMMA a song so alluring that all sailors who hear it crash into the rocks and die .PERIOD <BREAK>
I want to hear that song .PERIOD Untie me .PERIOD <BREAK>
There is first ,COMMA the present self .PERIOD <BREAK>
Well resisting temptation is hard ,COMMA as the 19 th century English economist Nassau William Senior said ,COMMA To abstain from the enjoyment which is in our power ,COMMA or to seek distant rather than immediate results ,COMMA are among the most painful exertions of the human will .PERIOD <BREAK>
So the first is ,COMMA when you've got one of these devices going ,COMMA such as this contract to write everyday or pay ,COMMA it's just a constant reminder that you have no self-control .PERIOD <BREAK>
The other problem with commitment devices is that you can always weasel your way out of them .PERIOD <BREAK>
And this is a timely issue .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we're at a situation now where for every three baby boomers ,COMMA the McKinsey Global Institute predicts that two will not be able to meet their pre-retirement needs while they're in retirement .PERIOD <BREAK>
He said that ,COMMA We might neglect our future selves because of some failure of belief or imagination .PERIOD <BREAK>
When you make an investment ,COMMA what you're really saying is ,COMMA I accept that any one of these 100 things could happen to me and determine my wealth .PERIOD <BREAK>
Once you find an investment that you're happy with ,COMMA what people do is they click done and the markers begin to disappear ,COMMA slowly ,COMMA one by one .PERIOD <BREAK>
If you save very little ,COMMA the future self is unhappy living on 44 percent of the income .PERIOD <BREAK>
And what's nice about it is it's not something that biasing people actually ,COMMA because as one face smiles ,COMMA the other face frowns .PERIOD <BREAK>
There are programs you can get to see how people might look if they smoke ,COMMA if they get too much exposure to the sun ,COMMA if they gain weight and so on .PERIOD <BREAK>
Hal is here ,COMMA so I think we owe it to him as well as yourself to disabuse you of that last image .PERIOD <BREAK>
I began my life as a markets professional and continued to take an interest ,COMMA but most of my recent effort has been looking at the value of what comes to human beings from nature ,COMMA and which doesn't get priced by the markets .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the answer is :COLON Yeah ,COMMA it can .PERIOD <BREAK>
Biodiversity ,COMMA the living fabric of this planet ,COMMA is not a gas .PERIOD <BREAK>
And if you look at the species level ,COMMA you saw about fish .PERIOD <BREAK>
And at this rate at which we are losing fish ,COMMA it is a human problem of enormous dimensions ,COMMA a health problem of a kind we haven't seen before .PERIOD <BREAK>
The green represents the percentage .PERIOD <BREAK>
The reason this is happening boils down ,COMMA in my mind ,COMMA to one basic problem ,COMMA which is our inability to perceive the difference between public benefits and private profits .PERIOD <BREAK>
We tend to constantly ignore public wealth simply because it is in the common wealth ,COMMA it's common goods .PERIOD <BREAK>
It causes pollutants being issued ,COMMA which have an economic cost ,COMMA health cost and so on .PERIOD <BREAK>
When we measure GDP as a measure of economic performance at the national level ,COMMA we don't include our biggest asset at the country level .PERIOD <BREAK>
When we measure corporate performances ,COMMA we don't include our impacts on nature and what our business costs society .PERIOD <BREAK>
That has to stop .PERIOD <BREAK>
So clearly there was a problem with deforestation .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I couldn't answer because neither of these companies ,COMMA good though they are and professional though they are ,COMMA do not calculate or disclose their externalities .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's an example ,COMMA I think ,COMMA for us to look at and for us to draw comfort from .PERIOD <BREAK>
If more companies did this ,COMMA and if more sectors engaged this as sectors ,COMMA you could have analysts ,COMMA business analysts ,COMMA and you could have people like us and consumers and NGOs actually look and compare the social performance of companies .PERIOD <BREAK>
has already set up a coalition to do this ,COMMA an international coalition .PERIOD <BREAK>
A bit like inflation :COLON you over-issue currency ,COMMA you get what you see ,COMMA declining prices .PERIOD <BREAK>
So in selecting targets of 450 parts per million and selecting two degrees at the climate negotiations ,COMMA what we have done is we've made an ethical choice .PERIOD <BREAK>
I decided when I was asked to do this that what I really wanted to talk about was my friend Richard Feynman .PERIOD <BREAK>
Richard Feynman was a very complex man .PERIOD <BREAK>
He was a man of many ,COMMA many parts .PERIOD <BREAK>
It may still exist ;SEMICOLON I don't know .PERIOD <BREAK>
But it was really brutal .PERIOD <BREAK>
But the amazing thing was -- Feynman had to leave a little early .PERIOD <BREAK>
Sometimes I would win ,COMMA mostly he would win ,COMMA but we both enjoyed them .PERIOD <BREAK>
And he said ,COMMA Leonardo ,COMMA were you closer to your mother or to you father when you were a kid ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Being Dick ,COMMA he ,COMMA of course ,COMMA wanted to check this .PERIOD <BREAK>
There went that theory down the trashcan of history .PERIOD <BREAK>
But let me tell you a little bit about Feynman the physicist .PERIOD <BREAK>
He would try to visualize it ,COMMA guided by a small number of simple principles .PERIOD <BREAK>
It was so simple ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA that I suspect a really smart high school student ,COMMA who didn't even have calculus ,COMMA could understand what he wrote down .PERIOD <BREAK>
You simply take the proton ,COMMA and you hit it really sharply with an electron .PERIOD <BREAK>
So I think I'll just finish up by saying I actually don't think Feynman would have liked this event .PERIOD <BREAK>
Thank you .PERIOD <BREAK>
When this trailer showed up at my shop in Berkeley ,COMMA I'd actually never stepped foot in an Airstream trailer ,COMMA or any other trailer .PERIOD <BREAK>
I decided I had to do some research and really figure out what had gone wrong somewhere along the history of Airstream .PERIOD <BREAK>
There's no such things as two walls and a ceiling coming together ,COMMA where you can change materials and shapes .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's the trailer ,COMMA pretty much finished .PERIOD <BREAK>
I thought ,COMMA Finally ,COMMA oh yeah great ,COMMA big company ,COMMA I'm gonna work with somebody with money for tooling and molding .PERIOD <BREAK>
Welcome to Five Dangerous Things You Should Let Your Children Do .PERIOD <BREAK>
We put warnings on coffee cups to tell us that the contents may be hot .PERIOD <BREAK>
So where does this trend stop ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And yeah ,COMMA they're going to cut themselves .PERIOD <BREAK>
So practicing throwing things has been shown to stimulate the frontal and parietal lobes ,COMMA which have to do with visual acuity ,COMMA 3 D understanding ,COMMA and structural problem solving ,COMMA so it gives a sense -- it helps develop their visualization skills and their predictive ability .PERIOD <BREAK>
Number four -- deconstruct appliances .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it's fun for the whole family .PERIOD <BREAK>
Narrator :COLON We are all aware of the risk of cancer ,COMMA but there's another disease that's destined to affect even more of us :COLON arthritis .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is the field of biologic replacements ,COMMA where we replace worn-out parts with new ,COMMA natural ones .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it works ,COMMA not just for my wife ,COMMA but certainly for other patients .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so that's not going to be a solution that's going to get us global with biologic tissue .PERIOD <BREAK>
How are we going to revolutionize artificial joint replacement ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
The space age began 50 years ago in October ,COMMA and that’s exactly what Sputnik looked like .PERIOD <BREAK>
They would bring them back and mount them .PERIOD <BREAK>
So that’s for fun .PERIOD <BREAK>
You can see how portable and handy it was to have your own Guttenberg in 1455 .PERIOD <BREAK>
In 1455 ,COMMA nobody could read .PERIOD <BREAK>
But why is this so interesting ?QUESTIONMARK Here’s the quick story .PERIOD <BREAK>
That is why the printing press succeeded ,COMMA and that is why Martin Luther nailed his 90 theses to the door :COLON because he was complaining that the Catholic Church had gone amok in printing out indulgences and selling them in every town and village and city in all of Western Europe .PERIOD <BREAK>
Instead of showing an object from the stage I’m going to do something special for the first time .PERIOD <BREAK>
We are going to show ,COMMA actually ,COMMA what the library looks like ,COMMA OK ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And all throughout the library are different objects ,COMMA different spaces .PERIOD <BREAK>
And yet ,COMMA looking at them ,COMMA you would see a machine and a molecule .PERIOD <BREAK>
And what does a lump of coal have to do with the Internet ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
What that means is ,COMMA a 200 -megabyte file looks like this ,COMMA ladies and gentlemen .PERIOD OK ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
The ego is not supposed to be involved in graphic design .PERIOD <BREAK>
So then I can add some color in with the background and add a bit more color in with the words themselves ,COMMA and this way ,COMMA working with the art director ,COMMA I'm able to bring it to just the right point that it's puzzling for the audience -- they can figure out that there's something they have to read -- but it's not impossible for them to read .PERIOD <BREAK>
So I'm currently working on a book ,COMMA which plays with both senses of the word ,COMMA as I explore some of my own ideas and inquiries in a visual display of rather peacock-like grandeur .PERIOD <BREAK>
I've been sending out valentines on a fairly large scale since 2005 .PERIOD <BREAK>
There's a longer story to this ,COMMA but I did get them all done in time ,COMMA and they were extremely well received .PERIOD <BREAK>
I got an almost 100 percent response rate .PERIOD <BREAK>
I had this idea that I wanted people to receive a kind of mysterious love letter ,COMMA like a found fragment in their mailbox .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I specifically wrote four pages that don't connect .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'm certain I can see you blushing .PERIOD <BREAK>
So I solicited friends to send me their used Christmas cards ,COMMA and I made 500 of these .PERIOD <BREAK>
What does it say ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
So that's why I do what I do ,COMMA and why I spend so much time and effort on it ,COMMA and why I work in the commercial ,COMMA public sphere ,COMMA as opposed to the isolated ,COMMA private sphere of fine art :COLON because I want as many people as possible to see my work ,COMMA notice it ,COMMA be drawn into it ,COMMA and be able to take something from it .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I actually really feel that it's worthwhile to spend my valuable and limited time on this Earth in this way .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I thank you for allowing me to show it to you .PERIOD <BREAK>
The main characteristics of such a system is that there's one sole contact point to the ground .PERIOD <BREAK>
He's now keeping a constant distance to Thomas .PERIOD <BREAK>
And of course ,COMMA who wouldn't like to take a ride on one of these .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I say ,COMMA What is the light bulb good for ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Even when you're standing in front of a megaphone ,COMMA it's pretty much every direction .PERIOD <BREAK>
I got this waterfall I recorded in my back yard .PERIOD <BREAK>
You have to be kind of smart ,COMMA and though I did not graduate from college doesn't mean I'm stupid ,COMMA because you cannot be stupid and do very much in the world today .PERIOD <BREAK>
We're just starting to really discover the laws of nature and science and physics .PERIOD <BREAK>
I have been really lucky with this technology :COLON all of a sudden as it is ready ,COMMA the world is ready to accept it .PERIOD <BREAK>
This unit that I played goes from about 200 hertz to above the range of hearing .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's actually emitting ultrasound -- low-level ultrasound -- that's about 100000 vibrations per second .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the sound that you're hearing ,COMMA unlike a regular speaker on which all the sound is made on the face ,COMMA is made out in front of it ,COMMA in the air .PERIOD <BREAK>
Or you can whisper in the ear of a supposed terrorist some Biblical verse .PERIOD <BREAK>
We put it on a turret with a camera ,COMMA so that when they shoot at you ,COMMA you're over there ,COMMA and it's there .PERIOD <BREAK>
I took it back to the Pentagon after it got declassified ,COMMA when the patent issued ,COMMA and told the people back there about it ,COMMA and they laughed ,COMMA and then I took them back a demo and they bought .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA I've been really lucky as an inventor .PERIOD <BREAK>
I've got a Coke can opening that's right in your head ;SEMICOLON that's really cool .PERIOD <BREAK>
Appreciate it very much .PERIOD <BREAK>
I thought I would talk a little bit about how nature makes materials .PERIOD <BREAK>
I've been fascinated by how nature makes materials ,COMMA and there's a lot of sequence to how they do such an exquisite job .PERIOD <BREAK>
So that's the vision that I've been thinking about .PERIOD <BREAK>
There's diatoms made out of SIO 2 ,COMMA and they're magnetotactic bacteria that make small ,COMMA single-domain magnets used for navigation .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I was really fortunate to have President Obama visit my lab this year on his visit to MIT ,COMMA and I really wanted to give him a periodic table .PERIOD <BREAK>
What if he says ,COMMA 'Oh ,COMMA I already have one' or ,COMMA 'I've already memorized it' ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Now if you take all billion viruses ,COMMA and you can put them in one drop of liquid ,COMMA you can force them to interact with anything you want on the periodic table .PERIOD <BREAK>
So basically ,COMMA viruses can't replicate themselves ;SEMICOLON they need a host .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so through a process of selection evolution ,COMMA we went from being able to have a virus that made a crummy battery to a virus that made a good battery to a virus that made a record-breaking ,COMMA high-powered battery that's all made at room temperature ,COMMA basically at the bench top .PERIOD <BREAK>
You can make lots of amplifications to it .PERIOD <BREAK>
When you shine light on them ,COMMA you can see them bubbling .PERIOD <BREAK>
In this case ,COMMA you're seeing oxygen bubbles come out .PERIOD <BREAK>
The last example are solar cells .PERIOD <BREAK>
And what we've found is through genetic engineering ,COMMA we can actually increase the efficiencies of these solar cells to record numbers for these types of dye-sensitized systems .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'll hear things like an extra room in the house ,COMMA the basement ,COMMA the coffee shop ,COMMA the library .PERIOD <BREAK>
And then you'll hear things like the train ,COMMA a plane ,COMMA a car -- so ,COMMA the commute .PERIOD <BREAK>
Why is that happening ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
You don't have a workday anymore .PERIOD You have work moments .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's like the front door of the office is like a Cuisinart ,COMMA and you walk in and your day is shredded to bits ,COMMA because you have 15 minutes here and 30 minutes there ,COMMA and then something else happens and you're pulled off your work ,COMMA and you've got to do something else ,COMMA then you have 20 minutes ,COMMA then it's lunch .PERIOD <BREAK>
I sat at my desk .PERIOD I used my expensive computer .PERIOD <BREAK>
You might have a quick idea ,COMMA but to be in deep thought about a problem and really consider a problem carefully ,COMMA you need long stretches of uninterrupted time .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA there are different kinds of distractions ,COMMA but there aren't the really bad kinds of distractions that I'll talk about in just a minute .PERIOD <BREAK>
So sleep is about sleep phases ,COMMA or stages -- some people call them different things .PERIOD <BREAK>
If you're interrupted and woken up ,COMMA you have to start again .PERIOD <BREAK>
I don't think anyone would say yes .PERIOD <BREAK>
They'll also say -- sometimes they'll also say ,COMMA Well ,COMMA if I can't see the person ,COMMA how do I know they're working ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
which is ridiculous ,COMMA of course ,COMMA but that's one of the excuses that managers give .PERIOD <BREAK>
No one cared about letting people take a smoke break for 15 minutes 10 years ago ,COMMA so why does everyone care about someone going to Facebook here and there ,COMMA or Twitter here and there ,COMMA or YouTube here and there ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Those are the real problems in the modern office today .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's kind of bad .PERIOD <BREAK>
And meetings are just toxic ,COMMA terrible ,COMMA poisonous things during the day at work .PERIOD <BREAK>
What if they're doing important work ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
If there are 10 people in the meeting ,COMMA it's a 10 -hour meeting ;SEMICOLON it's not a one-hour meeting .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's 10 hours of productivity taken from the rest of the organization to have this one one-hour meeting ,COMMA which probably should have been handled by two or three people talking for a few minutes .PERIOD <BREAK>
These things don't exist outside of the office .PERIOD <BREAK>
I have about three minutes ,COMMA so that'll fit perfectly .PERIOD <BREAK>
I don't know if people still do that .PERIOD <BREAK>
So just the afternoon ,COMMA one Thursday .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is when people actually get stuff done ,COMMA is when no one's bothering them ,COMMA when no one's interrupting them .PERIOD <BREAK>
All these discussions and decisions you thought you had to make at this one time at 9 am .PERIOD on Monday ,COMMA just forget about them ,COMMA and things will be just fine .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I specialize in human behavioral research ,COMMA and applying what we learn to think about the future in different ways ,COMMA and to design for that future .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it'll take about another two years to connect the next billion after that .PERIOD <BREAK>
So this is interesting to us ,COMMA because the conscious and subconscious decision process implies that the stuff that you do take with you and end up using has some kind of spiritual ,COMMA emotional or functional value .PERIOD <BREAK>
But if you ask people what the three most important things that they carry are -- across cultures and across gender and across contexts -- most people will say keys ,COMMA money and ,COMMA if they own one ,COMMA a mobile phone .PERIOD <BREAK>
And a mobile phone ,COMMA it turns out ,COMMA is a great recovery tool .PERIOD <BREAK>
But -- and it's a pretty big but -- we forget .PERIOD <BREAK>
I think ,COMMA quite a nice feature .PERIOD <BREAK>
And these things don't stay in the center of gravity ,COMMA but over time ,COMMA they gravitate there .PERIOD <BREAK>
But the difference between this and that is ,COMMA there's no central authority trying to control this .PERIOD <BREAK>
And OK ,COMMA if you break one of these things here ,COMMA you return it to the carrier .PERIOD <BREAK>
They'll probably give you three new ones ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
It challenges the norms .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is how it's shifting .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'm just the messenger .PERIOD <BREAK>
And companies like Navigenics and DNA Direct and 23 andMe ,COMMA that are giving you your genetic profiles ,COMMA are giving some people a sense of ,COMMA Gosh ,COMMA well ,COMMA what can I do about it ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And so my request is ,COMMA please ,COMMA let's make technologies that make people more human ,COMMA and not less .PERIOD <BREAK>
I made a lot of mistakes and dumb decisions ,COMMA of course .PERIOD <BREAK>
So let's say for instance that you're on your way to your best friend's wedding and you're trying to get to the airport and you're stuck in terrible traffic ,COMMA and you finally arrive at your gate and you've missed your flight .PERIOD <BREAK>
We wish we'd taken better advantage of the education that we did have .PERIOD <BREAK>
Odds are ,COMMA you're not going to care in five years .PERIOD <BREAK>
It feels terrible .PERIOD Regret feels awful .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the thought was ,COMMA Make it go away !EXCLAMATIONMARK <BREAK>
We just want it to vanish .PERIOD <BREAK>
Make it go away .PERIOD Make it go away .PERIOD <BREAK>
In point of fact ,COMMA no insurance covers acts of idiocy .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the problem is that there are certain things that happen in life that we desperately want to change and we cannot .PERIOD <BREAK>
But first I want to say that the intensity and persistence with which we experience these emotional components of regret is obviously going to vary depending on the specific thing that we're feeling regretful about .PERIOD <BREAK>
The FDA estimates that of all the Americans who have tattoos ,COMMA 17 percent of us regret getting them .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now in my case ,COMMA this really wasn't a problem ,COMMA because it's actually very easy to laugh at yourself when you're 29 years old and you want your mommy because you don't like your new tattoo .PERIOD <BREAK>
All right .PERIOD <BREAK>
And what I loved about this image of the compass was that I felt like it encapsulated both of these ideas in one simple image .PERIOD <BREAK>
Even in wealthy countries it is common now to see inequality growing .PERIOD <BREAK>
In the United States ,COMMA since 2001 we've had five years of economic growth ,COMMA five years of productivity growth in the workplace ,COMMA but median wages are stagnant and the percentage of working families dropping below the poverty line is up by four percent .PERIOD <BREAK>
It is also unstable .PERIOD <BREAK>
Because primarily of the power of the Internet ,COMMA people of modest means can band together and amass vast sums of money that can change the world for some public good if they all agree .PERIOD <BREAK>
You saw one reference to that in what we were able to do with AIDS drugs .PERIOD <BREAK>
When I got out of office and was asked to work ,COMMA first in the Caribbean ,COMMA to try to help deal with the AIDS crisis ,COMMA generic drugs were available for about 500 dollars a person a year .PERIOD <BREAK>
We need a movie on those six categories .PERIOD <BREAK>
And all of you need to have it embedded in your brains and to organize yourselves around it .PERIOD <BREAK>
You think about whatever your life has been ,COMMA however many obstacles you have faced in your life ,COMMA at critical junctures you always knew there was a predictable connection between the effort you exerted and the result you achieved .PERIOD <BREAK>
As poor as Haiti is ,COMMA in the area where Farmer's clinic is active -- and they serve a catchment area far greater than the medical professionals they have would indicate they could serve -- since 1988 ,COMMA they have not lost one person to tuberculosis ,COMMA not one .PERIOD <BREAK>
We're essentially implementing what Paul Farmer did in Haiti :COLON he develops and trains paid community health workers who are able to identify health problems ,COMMA ensure that people who have AIDS or TB are properly diagnosed and take their medicine regularly ,COMMA who work on bringing about health education ,COMMA clean water and sanitation ,COMMA providing nutritional supplements and moving people up the chain of health care if they have problems of the severity that require it .PERIOD <BREAK>
The procedures that make this work have been perfected ,COMMA as I said ,COMMA by Paul Farmer and his team in their work in rural Haiti over the last 20 years .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the results were so good that the Rwandan government has now agreed to adopt the model for the entire country ,COMMA and has strongly supported and put the full resources of the government behind it .PERIOD <BREAK>
And then we have others working in these other related programs .PERIOD <BREAK>
So she now works full-time on this for very little pay .PERIOD <BREAK>
And not a single soul in this area was being treated for AIDS or tuberculosis .PERIOD <BREAK>
Listen to this :COLON less than four-tenths of one percent of those being treated stopped taking their medicine or otherwise defaulted on treatment .PERIOD <BREAK>
We're now working with Partners in Health and the Ministry of Health in Rwanda and our Foundation folks to scale this system up .PERIOD <BREAK>
We need initial upfront investment to train doctors ,COMMA nurses ,COMMA health administration and community health workers throughout the country ,COMMA to set up the information technology ,COMMA the solar energy ,COMMA the water and sanitation ,COMMA the transportation infrastructure .PERIOD <BREAK>
I had a really hard time in school .PERIOD <BREAK>
In fact ,COMMA my mother told me eventually that I was the little kid in the village who cried all the way to school .PERIOD <BREAK>
I ran away .PERIOD <BREAK>
And when the natural breeze isn't enough ,COMMA the kids deploy bubbles ,COMMA but not the kind of bubbles you know .PERIOD <BREAK>
They know they can control their world .PERIOD <BREAK>
Landscaping .PERIOD <BREAK>
They're part of the rice cycle and these skills will be valuable for them in their future .PERIOD <BREAK>
The food is incredible .PERIOD <BREAK>
Green School is a place of pioneers ,COMMA local and global .PERIOD <BREAK>
The kids are from 25 countries .PERIOD <BREAK>
You practice ancient Balinese arts .PERIOD <BREAK>
The kids love it .PERIOD <BREAK>
And together these volunteers and the teachers are deeply committed to creating a new generation of global ,COMMA green leaders .PERIOD <BREAK>
The Green School effect -- we don't know what it is .PERIOD <BREAK>
And how did we do all this ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
It's a double helix .PERIOD <BREAK>
From the time the foundations were finished ,COMMA in three months it had roofs and floors .PERIOD <BREAK>
You ruined my life ,COMMA but you gave me an incredible future .PERIOD <BREAK>
And then a third attempt ,COMMA which also patched me back together pretty well ,COMMA until it failed .PERIOD <BREAK>
I tried out various computer voices that were available online ,COMMA and for several months I had a British accent ,COMMA which Chaz called Sir Lawrence .PERIOD <BREAK>
There are all sorts of html codes you can use to control the timing and inflection of computer voices ,COMMA and I've experimented with them .PERIOD <BREAK>
But what value do we place on the sound of our own voice ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
But it wasn't that simple .PERIOD <BREAK>
or Roger 20 .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is the first version of my computer voice .PERIOD <BREAK>
When I read something ,COMMA it will read in my voice .PERIOD <BREAK>
The voice was created by a company in Scotland named CereProc .PERIOD <BREAK>
I plan to use it on television ,COMMA radio and the Internet .PERIOD <BREAK>
People who need a voice should know that most computers already come with built-in speaking systems .PERIOD <BREAK>
John Hunter :COLON All my life I was a motormouth .PERIOD <BREAK>
I doubt ,COMMA on that day 50 years ago ,COMMA they even dreamed of what Salman Khan has accomplished .PERIOD <BREAK>
But that's not the point .PERIOD <BREAK>
I have learned from Wikipedia that ,COMMA starting with that humble beginning ,COMMA PLATO established forums ,COMMA message boards ,COMMA online testing ,COMMA email ,COMMA chat rooms ,COMMA picture languages ,COMMA instant messaging ,COMMA remote screen sharing and multiple-player games .PERIOD <BREAK>
But online ,COMMA everybody speaks at the same speed .PERIOD <BREAK>
Ironic that my legs are fine ,COMMA and it's my shoulders that slow up my walk .PERIOD <BREAK>
When you see me today ,COMMA I look like the Phantom of the Opera .PERIOD <BREAK>
I’d like to dedicate this one to all the women in South Africa -- those women who refused to dwindle in the midst of apartheid .PERIOD <BREAK>

Let me tell you my story .PERIOD <BREAK>
I came to London ,COMMA and I've seen performance by Cirque du Soleil .PERIOD <BREAK>
I wanted my artistic statement ,COMMA my interpretation of reality .PERIOD <BREAK>
The secret is that we were treating the whole newspaper as one piece ,COMMA as one composition -- like music .PERIOD <BREAK>
And design is responsible for this experience .PERIOD <BREAK>
What really makes it amazing :COLON that the circulation of these newspapers were growing too .PERIOD <BREAK>
Same in Poland :COLON plus 13 ,COMMA up to 35 percent raise of circulation after three years .PERIOD <BREAK>
You can work for a small company ,COMMA in a boring branch .PERIOD <BREAK>
So bear with me as I take you through this journey .PERIOD <BREAK>
I was running across the street ,COMMA and the only thing that I actually remember is feeling like a grenade went off in my head .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I remember putting my hands on the ground and feeling my life's blood emptying out of my neck and my mouth .PERIOD <BREAK>
I had no idea what was going on ,COMMA but strangers intervened ,COMMA kept my heart moving ,COMMA beating .PERIOD <BREAK>
I had lots of titanium put in me ,COMMA cadaver bones to try to get my feet moving the right way .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I needed that wisdom at that moment in my life .PERIOD <BREAK>
So they eventually started matching their talents and skills to all of my needs .PERIOD <BREAK>
So they figured not being able to see is one thing ,COMMA but they need to get me to talk .PERIOD <BREAK>
The redundancy was actually good for me .PERIOD <BREAK>
So everything is different when you're a sighted person because you take that for granted .PERIOD <BREAK>
We didn't have words like crowd-sourcing and radical collaboration when I had my accident .PERIOD <BREAK>
A peasant ,COMMA who was walking to market that morning ,COMMA ran towards where the gunshot had come from ,COMMA and found a young man writhing in agony on the floor ,COMMA clearly shot by a dueling wound .PERIOD <BREAK>
Galois was taken to the local hospital where he died the next day in the arms of his brother .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the last words he said to his brother were ,COMMA Don't cry for me ,COMMA Alfred .PERIOD <BREAK>
But a few years earlier ,COMMA while still at school ,COMMA he'd actually cracked one of the big mathematical problems at the time .PERIOD <BREAK>
Symmetry can also help us to explain what's happening in the Large Hadron Collider in CERN .PERIOD <BREAK>
Artists too love to play around with symmetry .PERIOD <BREAK>
Here is Thomas Mann talking about symmetry in The Magic Mountain .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the gateway you see behind has eight columns ,COMMA with beautiful symmetrical designs on them .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I said to Professor Kurokawa ,COMMA Wow ,COMMA the architects must have really been kicking themselves when they realized that they'd made a mistake and put this one upside down .PERIOD <BREAK>
Recently I took my family -- we do these rather kind of nerdy mathematical trips ,COMMA which my family love .PERIOD <BREAK>
I think one of the problems about school mathematics is it doesn't look at how mathematics is embedded in the world we live in .PERIOD <BREAK>
So they explored a more geometric art .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the power of mathematics is often to change one thing into another ,COMMA to change geometry into language .PERIOD <BREAK>
Actually ,COMMA the invention of the number zero was a very modern concept ,COMMA seventh century AD ,COMMA by the Indians .PERIOD <BREAK>
I can reflect it in the line through X ,COMMA or the line through Y ,COMMA or the line through Z .PERIOD <BREAK>
So both of these objects have six symmetries .PERIOD <BREAK>
So the little table here records how the algebra of these symmetries work .PERIOD <BREAK>
And this enables us to distinguish why the symmetries of these objects -- they both have six symmetries .PERIOD So why shouldn't we say they have the same symmetries ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And ,COMMA using those rules ,COMMA he was able to say that there are in fact only two objects with six symmetries .PERIOD <BREAK>
And all the tiles match up again .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA there was a sixth of a turn .PERIOD A third of a turn where the Z pieces meet .PERIOD <BREAK>
How many symmetries does a Rubik's Cube have ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Rather than you all shouting out ,COMMA I want you to count how many digits there are in that number .PERIOD Okay ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Because this one .PERIOD I think there were a few here .PERIOD <BREAK>
The people who just last sat down .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I'd like to review just how unintended consequences play the part that they do .PERIOD <BREAK>
But he did his best ,COMMA and he kept meticulous records that let him transform that branch of medicine .PERIOD <BREAK>
So there were benefits in calamities -- benefits to pure science ,COMMA as well as to applied science and medicine .PERIOD <BREAK>
There are two historians of business at the University of Maryland ,COMMA Brent Goldfarb and David Kirsch ,COMMA who have done some extremely interesting work ,COMMA much of it still unpublished ,COMMA on the history of major innovations .PERIOD <BREAK>
They have combined the list of major innovations ,COMMA and they've discovered that the greatest number ,COMMA the greatest decade ,COMMA for fundamental innovations ,COMMA as reflected in all of the lists that others have made -- a number of lists that they have merged -- was the Great Depression .PERIOD <BREAK>
So we see that sometimes ,COMMA as a result of these dislocations ,COMMA as a result of people leaving their original intended career and going into something else where their creativity could make a difference ,COMMA that depressions and all kinds of other unfortunate events can have a paradoxically stimulating effect on creativity .PERIOD <BREAK>
We need to see what they can do for us .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's kind of like a new approach to desktop computing .PERIOD <BREAK>
And some of those we wanted to transfer to the icons in our system .PERIOD <BREAK>
Also just like paper ,COMMA around our workspace we'll pin things up to the wall to remember them later ,COMMA and I can do the same thing here ,COMMA and you know ,COMMA you'll see post-it notes and things like that around people's offices .PERIOD <BREAK>
So one thing we have for that is like a grid align ,COMMA kind of -- so you get that more traditional desktop .PERIOD Things are kind of grid aligned .PERIOD <BREAK>
The photo was made when we were deep in the valley over there .PERIOD <BREAK>
But I think the point is that this is metaphor with teeth ,COMMA and it's with those teeth that I want to propose today that we rethink a little bit about the role of contemporary math -- not just financial math ,COMMA but math in general .PERIOD <BREAK>
And he said ,COMMA It's funny you ask that ,COMMA because it's actually called black box trading .PERIOD <BREAK>
There's a company in Boston called Nanex ,COMMA and they use math and magic and I don't know what ,COMMA and they reach into all the market data and they find ,COMMA actually sometimes ,COMMA some of these algorithms .PERIOD <BREAK>
And when they find them they pull them out and they pin them to the wall like butterflies .PERIOD <BREAK>
Pragmatic Chaos is ,COMMA like all of Netflix algorithms ,COMMA trying to do the same thing .PERIOD <BREAK>
Pragmatic Chaos ,COMMA like all Netflix algorithms ,COMMA determines ,COMMA in the end ,COMMA 60 percent of what movies end up being rented .PERIOD <BREAK>
Wouldn't that be handy ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And it uses what's called a bin-packing algorithm .PERIOD <BREAK>
And this is really where the wires come right up into the city .PERIOD <BREAK>
But before I dive into those I want to admit that I am an optimist .PERIOD <BREAK>
And part of the reason I feel that way is looking at the past .PERIOD <BREAK>
Another statistic ,COMMA perhaps my favorite ,COMMA is to look at childhood deaths .PERIOD <BREAK>
The next breakthrough is to cut that 10 million in half again .PERIOD <BREAK>
Why ?QUESTIONMARK Well there's only a few diseases that account for the vast majority of those deaths :COLON diarrhea ,COMMA pneumonia and malaria .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the disease was all over the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
And two tools helped bring the death rate down .PERIOD <BREAK>
But ,COMMA malaria -- even the million deaths a year caused by malaria greatly understate its impact .PERIOD <BREAK>
Over 200 million people at any one time are suffering from it .PERIOD <BREAK>
And bed nets are a great tool .PERIOD <BREAK>
So every tool that we've ever had in the past has eventually become ineffective .PERIOD <BREAK>
It involves communicators to keep the funding high ,COMMA to keep the visibility high ,COMMA to tell the success stories .PERIOD <BREAK>
It involves social scientists ,COMMA so we know how to get not just 70 percent of the people to use the bed nets ,COMMA but 90 percent .PERIOD <BREAK>
It seems like the kind of question that people would spend a lot of time on ,COMMA and we'd understand very well .PERIOD <BREAK>
Let's start with why this is important .PERIOD <BREAK>
Not only has that been weak .PERIOD it's getting weaker .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the answer is no .PERIOD <BREAK>
But it in no way is associated with being a better teacher .PERIOD <BREAK>
They have 66 schools -- mostly middle schools ,COMMA some high schools -- and what goes on is great teaching .PERIOD <BREAK>
If you have a kid who's behind ,COMMA you would know you could assign them that video to watch and review the concept .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'm going to send everyone here a free copy of this book .PERIOD <BREAK>
I only have three minutes so I'm going to have to talk fast ,COMMA and it will use up your spare mental cycles ,COMMA so multitasking may be hard .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA it's logical that you'd have one there ,COMMA on the minor road entering the major .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so ,COMMA the question is ,COMMA what does that cost us ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
That's just the gasoline cost .PERIOD There is also pollution ,COMMA wear on the car ,COMMA and time .PERIOD <BREAK>
Discount that back to the present ,COMMA at five percent :COLON over two million dollars for a stop sign ,COMMA in each direction .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA if you look at what that adjacent property is worth ,COMMA you could actually buy the property ,COMMA cut down the shrubbery to improve the sight line ,COMMA and then sell it off again .PERIOD <BREAK>
And because we no longer need to use sunlight ,COMMA we have very specialized lights that are made for the operating room .PERIOD <BREAK>
And this is what I think is the magic of fluorescence .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's what the surgeon is saying in the operating room when the patient's on the table .PERIOD <BREAK>
But then we actually don't know that it's all out .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we wait .PERIOD <BREAK>
So now you're faced with telling your patient ,COMMA first of all ,COMMA that they may need another surgery ,COMMA or that they need additional therapy such as radiation or chemotherapy .PERIOD <BREAK>
So even if the tumor is not right on the surface ,COMMA you'll still be able to see it .PERIOD <BREAK>
So if you're driving on the freeway and you want to know where's the next gas station ,COMMA you have a map to tell you that that gas station is down the road .PERIOD <BREAK>
So with our technology ,COMMA we can tell right away .PERIOD <BREAK>
Nerves ,COMMA if they are injured ,COMMA can cause paralysis ,COMMA can cause pain .PERIOD <BREAK>
But you know what ,COMMA these little nerves are so small ,COMMA in the context of prostate cancer ,COMMA that they are actually never seen .PERIOD <BREAK>
People said ,COMMA We've been doing it this way for all these years .PERIOD <BREAK>
But I went ahead anyway .PERIOD <BREAK>
We have been able to see nerves for facial expression ,COMMA for facial movement ,COMMA for breathing -- every single nerve -- nerves for urinary function around the prostate .PERIOD <BREAK>
I have patients who would benefit from this .PERIOD <BREAK>
I think that this will result in my surgeries with a better outcome and fewer complications .PERIOD <BREAK>
And this takes the long-term steady courage of the day-in day-out struggle to educate ,COMMA to persuade and to win acceptance .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that is the light that I want to shine on health and medicine today .PERIOD <BREAK>
They receive input from thousands of upstream partners and compute their own electrical outputs ,COMMA which then ,COMMA if they pass a certain threshold ,COMMA will go to thousands of downstream partners .PERIOD <BREAK>
If we could activate cells ,COMMA we could see what powers they can unleash ,COMMA what they can initiate and sustain .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now in the 20 th century ,COMMA there was some hope that was generated through the development of pharmaceuticals for treating brain disorders ,COMMA and while many drugs have been developed that can alleviate symptoms of brain disorders ,COMMA practically none of them can be considered to be cured .PERIOD <BREAK>
There's one other magic trick you need to make this all happen ,COMMA and that's the ability to get light into the brain .PERIOD <BREAK>
So how do we do this ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And one of the things that we did was to adopt a very classical model of fear .PERIOD <BREAK>
And over time -- in this case ,COMMA a mouse ,COMMA which is a good animal model ,COMMA commonly used in such experiments -- the animal learns to fear the tone .PERIOD <BREAK>
The animal will react by freezing ,COMMA sort of like a deer in the headlights .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now I want to close on one story ,COMMA which we think is another possibility -- which is that maybe these molecules ,COMMA if you can do ultra-precise control ,COMMA can be used in the brain itself to make a new kind of prosthetic ,COMMA an optical prosthetic .PERIOD <BREAK>
Maybe 100000 people have Cochlear implants ,COMMA which allow them to hear .PERIOD <BREAK>
And new hope in gene therapy has been developed because viruses like the adeno-associated virus ,COMMA which probably most of us around this room have ,COMMA and it doesn't have any symptoms ,COMMA which have been used in hundreds of patients to deliver genes into the brain or the body .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the retina ,COMMA of course ,COMMA is a complex structure .PERIOD <BREAK>
We're going to take these blue light photosensors and install them on a layer of cells in the middle of the retina in the back of the eye and convert them into a camera -- just like installing solar cells all over those neurons to make them light sensitive .PERIOD <BREAK>
So this pre-clinical study ,COMMA I think ,COMMA bodes hope for the kinds of things we're hoping to do in the future .PERIOD <BREAK>
And by turning things off ,COMMA it's more or less a zero .PERIOD <BREAK>
Does that mean that some day you could download memories and maybe upload them ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
What determines the types and distributions of microbes indoors ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And we looked at three different types of rooms .PERIOD <BREAK>
Hospitals use two and a half times the amount of energy as office buildings .PERIOD <BREAK>
I've heard somebody say that you're as healthy as your gut .PERIOD <BREAK>
And obviously I'm physically a very strong person ,COMMA as you can tell -- -- so I wasn't worried about carrying this thing 20 blocks .PERIOD <BREAK>
People were out .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I thought ,COMMA well ,COMMA this is the power of a city .PERIOD <BREAK>
But the system itself of this city was thriving .PERIOD <BREAK>
Everybody contributes a little bit .PERIOD <BREAK>
Well ,COMMA it was the whole city .PERIOD <BREAK>
So it's been a very optimistic time ,COMMA I think ,COMMA and I want to just talk about a few of those things .PERIOD <BREAK>
That is -- you know ,COMMA there's no sentence that kind of conjures up that period better than that ,COMMA I think ,COMMA which is that you suddenly have the power to put up a picture of your dog and link to it ,COMMA and somebody reading the page has the power to click on that link or not click on that link .PERIOD <BREAK>
But it's still a very one-to-one kind of relationship .PERIOD <BREAK>
About two months ago ,COMMA I had the great breakthrough -- one of my great ,COMMA kind of shining achievements -- which is that my website finally became a top result for Steven Johnson .PERIOD <BREAK>
And in fact ,COMMA I think that's not entirely true anymore .PERIOD <BREAK>
That little list there would change .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's not necessarily something we didn't know already .PERIOD <BREAK>
I had no idea .PERIOD <BREAK>
But what's interesting is you can then broaden the search and actually see interesting things and get a sense of what else is out there .PERIOD <BREAK>
They're talking about slavery in 1860 .PERIOD <BREAK>
And OK ,COMMA I didn't learn anything new there as well -- that's pretty obvious .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'll go very quickly .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's caused a lot of controversy because people thought that this was the ultimate kind of one man ,COMMA one modem democracy ,COMMA where anybody can get out there and get their voice heard .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the question was ,COMMA were the birds singing ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Well ,COMMA in my world ,COMMA this is a rubber duck .PERIOD <BREAK>
That was a nice thing to get .PERIOD <BREAK>
If the end game is global warming ,COMMA they're doing great .PERIOD <BREAK>
So perhaps we could develop a strategy of change ,COMMA which requires humility .PERIOD And in my business as an architect ,COMMA it's unfortunate the word humility and the word architect have not appeared in the same paragraph since The Fountainhead .PERIOD <BREAK>
There is an infinite game ,COMMA and we're playing in that infinite game .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so we call it cradle to cradle ,COMMA and our goal is very simple .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is what I presented to the White House .PERIOD <BREAK>
So we've designed products and we analyzed chemicals down to the parts per million .PERIOD <BREAK>
We can ask ourselves ,COMMA what is justice ,COMMA and is justice blind ,COMMA or is justice blindness ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Is there anybody here who doesn't breathe ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Here's Dr .PERIOD Venkataswamy in India ,COMMA who's figured out how to do mass-produced health .PERIOD <BREAK>
They become building steel .PERIOD <BREAK>
My childhood summers were in the Puget Sound of Washington ,COMMA among the first growth and big growth .PERIOD <BREAK>
My grandfather had been a lumberjack in the Olympics ,COMMA so I have a lot of tree karma I am working off .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA all of a sudden ,COMMA here I am ,COMMA graduating from high school in 1969 ,COMMA and this happens ,COMMA and we realize that away went away .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now if we look at the word competition ,COMMA I'm sure most of you've used it .PERIOD <BREAK>
You know ,COMMA most people don't realize it comes from the Latin competere ,COMMA which means strive together .PERIOD <BREAK>
It means the way Olympic athletes train with each other .PERIOD <BREAK>
So we've been looking at the idea of competition as a way of cooperating in order to get fit together .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now most environmentalists don't say growth is good ,COMMA because ,COMMA in our lexicon ,COMMA asphalt is two words :COLON assigning blame .PERIOD <BREAK>
Technical nutrition will be in an order of magnitude of biological nutrition .PERIOD <BREAK>
Customers .PERIOD <BREAK>
Biotechnical nutrients -- the Model U for Ford Motor ,COMMA a cradle to cradle car -- concept car .PERIOD <BREAK>
The idea here of the car is that some of the materials go back to the industry forever ,COMMA some of the materials go back to soil -- it's all solar-powered .PERIOD <BREAK>
We're doing 12 cities for China right now ,COMMA based on cradle to cradle as templates .PERIOD <BREAK>
Our assignment is to develop protocols for the housing for 400 million people in 12 years .PERIOD <BREAK>
We start to integrate commercial and mixed use so the people all have centers and places to be .PERIOD <BREAK>
And then it makes natural gas ,COMMA which then goes back into the city to power the fuel for the cooking for the city .PERIOD <BREAK>
And then the compost is all taken back to the roofs of the city ,COMMA where we've got farming ,COMMA because what we've done is lifted up the city ,COMMA the landscape ,COMMA into the air to -- to restore the native landscape on the roofs of the buildings .PERIOD <BREAK>
They're probably less cell dense .PERIOD <BREAK>
And they're controlling basically everything that the nervous system has to do .PERIOD <BREAK>
Because what we're trying to measure ,COMMA the RNA -- which is the readout from our genes -- is very labile ,COMMA and so we have to move very quickly .PERIOD <BREAK>
And then the laser actually cuts .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now this may look like a bunch of dots to you ,COMMA but each one of these individual dots is actually a unique piece of the human genome that we spotted down on glass .PERIOD <BREAK>
And when we take a sample and we hybridize it to it ,COMMA we get a unique fingerprint ,COMMA if you will ,COMMA quantitatively of what genes are turned on in that sample .PERIOD <BREAK>
So roughly ,COMMA we have 50 million data points for a given human brain .PERIOD <BREAK>
Green is the sort of cool areas where it's not turned on .PERIOD <BREAK>
Genes send the instructions to make proteins .PERIOD <BREAK>
So drugs bind to proteins and either turn them off ,COMMA etc .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's as interesting a side effect as it could be .PERIOD <BREAK>
One other thing you can do with such a thing is you can ,COMMA because it's a pattern matching exercise ,COMMA because there's unique fingerprint ,COMMA we can actually scan through the entire genome and find other proteins that show a similar fingerprint .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now they can come in and they can start to get clues about activity .PERIOD <BREAK>
And then we find some outliers ,COMMA some things that lie beyond the cloud .PERIOD <BREAK>
And those genes are interesting ,COMMA but they're very subtle .PERIOD <BREAK>
These are things where genes are turned on in an individual cell type .PERIOD <BREAK>
I think these resources are incredibly valuable .PERIOD <BREAK>
And there is something else I believe in the back of your mind you also know .PERIOD <BREAK>
And worst of all ,COMMA we will never know .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the reason is that -- take Africa for example .PERIOD <BREAK>
Africans have already got a lot of aid .PERIOD <BREAK>
We don't know .PERIOD <BREAK>
And a third question :COLON Education .PERIOD <BREAK>
And in this way ,COMMA you can take the guesswork out of policy-making by knowing what works ,COMMA what doesn't work and why .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's going from intention to action .PERIOD <BREAK>
We cannot keep giving lentils to people .PERIOD <BREAK>
We can just run an experiment .PERIOD <BREAK>
Second thing is ,COMMA how about the use ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Well ,COMMA in business ,COMMA that's certainly not the way we would go about it .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now I'm going to show you what we get with various education interventions .PERIOD <BREAK>
So now ,COMMA I started from the big problem ,COMMA and I couldn't answer it .PERIOD <BREAK>
In Haiti ,COMMA about 200000 people died -- actually ,COMMA a bit more by the latest estimate .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA why is that ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
With deworming ,COMMA you can get an extra year of education for three dollars .PERIOD <BREAK>
So this evidence is powerful .PERIOD <BREAK>
It can prompt action .PERIOD <BREAK>
These economics I'm proposing ,COMMA it's like 20 th century medicine .PERIOD <BREAK>
Fantastic tales ,COMMA anecdotes from speakers .PERIOD <BREAK>
And turnarounds are part and parcel of what I have focused on for most of my professional career .PERIOD <BREAK>
And she said ,COMMA I want to write a case ,COMMA Euvin -- a case on a public-sector leader that has lessons for the corporate world .PERIOD <BREAK>
The first thing that I saw was North America at night -- glowing ,COMMA in all its glory .PERIOD A warm feeling .PERIOD Light .PERIOD <BREAK>
Entrepreneurs ,COMMA dynamic people ,COMMA people with hope .PERIOD <BREAK>
So let's start shedding light on this amazing eclectic continent that has so much to offer .PERIOD <BREAK>
So I want to share with you some of these bellwether signals ,COMMA or signs ,COMMA and winds of change that are sweeping this continent .PERIOD <BREAK>
And let's start at the high level ,COMMA on the macro-factors .PERIOD <BREAK>
Egypt :COLON from the 16 percent to about 84 percent .PERIOD <BREAK>
But what were they there for ?QUESTIONMARK To acquire assets .PERIOD <BREAK>
Guarantee Trust Bank recently issued the first Euro Bond out of Africa ,COMMA and this excludes South Africa .PERIOD <BREAK>
22 to 24 million barrels of oil a day -- the same league as Kuwait ,COMMA the same league as Venezuela .PERIOD <BREAK>
So let's unpack those very quickly ,COMMA and I'm going to move through these very ,COMMA very ,COMMA very fast because I can see that clock counting down .PERIOD <BREAK>
What else is going on there ?QUESTIONMARK Egypt .PERIOD <BREAK>
Close to the Mediterranean ,COMMA near Alexandria -- textiles ,COMMA petrochemicals .PERIOD <BREAK>
So what are the signs that things are fundamentally changing ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
What's going on in some of the other countries ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
But in any investment decision ,COMMA the key question is ,COMMA What is my alternative investment ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA when looking at Africa vis-a-vis other things ,COMMA and countries in Africa vis-a-vis other things ,COMMA comparisons become important .PERIOD <BREAK>
In 1899 ,COMMA Joseph Conrad released The Heart of Darkness ,COMMA a tale of grim horror along the Congo River .PERIOD <BREAK>
Brain magic to me indicates that area of magic dealing with psychological and mind-reading effects .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA now you can see how easy it is for me to manipulate the human mind ,COMMA once you know how .PERIOD <BREAK>
No ,COMMA but you're OK ,COMMA yes ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
That is weird .PERIOD <BREAK>
Thank you .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA I'm going to give you some demonstrations up here ,COMMA live ,COMMA right now .PERIOD <BREAK>
And let's see ,COMMA down at the end ,COMMA here ,COMMA can you also come up ,COMMA real quick ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA it's very important for everybody here to realize I haven't set anything up with you guys .PERIOD <BREAK>
You don't know what's about to happen .PERIOD Is that agreed ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
OK ,COMMA would you mind just standing over here for a moment ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Your name is ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
OK ,COMMA a little bit closer ,COMMA come over -- they look really nervous up here .PERIOD <BREAK>
Voodoo ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Besides ,COMMA who's next ,COMMA no ,COMMA OK .PERIOD <BREAK>
I want you to be aware of the sensations ,COMMA but don't say anything until I ask you ,COMMA and don't open your eyes until I ask you .PERIOD <BREAK>
Yes or no ,COMMA did you feel anything ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Yeah ,COMMA I walk around nightclubs all night like this .PERIOD <BREAK>
And can you take a seat right over here for me ,COMMA if you don't mind .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I want you to hold it there ,COMMA just for a moment ,COMMA and I only want you to allow your hand to sink and drift and float back to the tabletop at the same rate and speed as you drift and float into this relaxed state of awareness ,COMMA and allow it to go all the way down to the tabletop .PERIOD <BREAK>
OK ,COMMA and only when you feel the pressure go back ,COMMA I want you to allow your hand to slowly drift back to the tabletop ,COMMA but only when you feel the pressure .PERIOD <BREAK>
Allow it to stick firmly to the tabletop ,COMMA keep your eyes closed .PERIOD <BREAK>
Can you stand up ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Imagine a connection between you and him .PERIOD <BREAK>
Point directly at his forehead .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA I want you to be aware that in a moment ,COMMA when I snap my fingers ,COMMA your eyes will open ,COMMA again .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's nearly impossible to break a Coke bottle .PERIOD <BREAK>
You see ,COMMA psychokinesis is the paranormal influence of the mind on physical events and processes .PERIOD <BREAK>
Be careful ,COMMA because it is sharp .PERIOD Just hold on to it for a moment .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I want you to release that negative energy by shaking it from side to side .PERIOD <BREAK>
There's five letters in the title .PERIOD <BREAK>
There's a K in his name ,COMMA there is a K .PERIOD <BREAK>
You knew !EXCLAMATIONMARK <BREAK>
No one in the audience .PERIOD And just to help you out ,COMMA I'll block them from view ,COMMA so nobody can see what you're doing .PERIOD <BREAK>
But I don't want you to know either ,COMMA so swivel around on your chair .PERIOD <BREAK>
Your right hand .PERIOD Is that -- no ,COMMA OK .PERIOD <BREAK>
OK ,COMMA tell me when to stop .PERIOD <BREAK>
Yes ,COMMA there's one .PERIOD <BREAK>
OK .PERIOD Do you think it's here ,COMMA yes or no ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Neither ,COMMA oh ,COMMA OK .PERIOD <BREAK>
We're the only creatures with fully developed moral sentiments .PERIOD <BREAK>
After 10 years of experiments ,COMMA I found it .PERIOD <BREAK>
It can't be that important .PERIOD <BREAK>
Turns out it wasn't so easy .PERIOD <BREAK>
And when it's produced ,COMMA it has a three-minute half-life ,COMMA and degrades rapidly at room temperature .PERIOD <BREAK>
Then I had to measure morality .PERIOD <BREAK>
So I started smaller .PERIOD <BREAK>
So poor countries are by and large low trust countries .PERIOD <BREAK>
So we recruit some people for an experiment .PERIOD <BREAK>
We give them lots of instruction ,COMMA and we never ever deceive them .PERIOD <BREAK>
So think about this experiment for minute .PERIOD <BREAK>
But why ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Two things .PERIOD <BREAK>
I didn't know for sure oxytocin caused trustworthiness .PERIOD <BREAK>
I used everything short of a drill to get oxytocin into my own brain .PERIOD <BREAK>
These include massage ,COMMA dancing and praying .PERIOD <BREAK>
In this book ,COMMA Smith argued that we are moral creatures ,COMMA not because of a top-down reason ,COMMA but for a bottom-up reason .PERIOD <BREAK>
So if I do something that hurts you ,COMMA I feel that pain .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'm working at a gas station on the outskirts of Santa Barbara ,COMMA California .PERIOD <BREAK>
Tell that guy to wait half an hour .PERIOD <BREAK>
So this is a classic con called the pigeon drop ,COMMA and I was the pigeon .PERIOD <BREAK>
They have many of the attributes of psychopaths .PERIOD <BREAK>
One is through improper nurturing .PERIOD <BREAK>
So we've studied sexually abused women ,COMMA and about half those don't release oxytocin on stimulus .PERIOD <BREAK>
She had the biggest increase in oxytocin .PERIOD <BREAK>
So I think it tells us that we've designed this ritual to connect us to this new couple ,COMMA connect us emotionally .PERIOD <BREAK>
So my penchant for hugging other people has earned me the nickname Dr .PERIOD Love .PERIOD <BREAK>
We have found that people who release more oxytocin are happier .PERIOD <BREAK>
And they're happier because they have better relationships of all types .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'll play at these rock shows ,COMMA be on stage standing completely still ,COMMA and they're like ,COMMA What's she doing !EXCLAMATIONMARK What's she doing !EXCLAMATIONMARK <BREAK>
So basically ,COMMA with both of your hands you're controlling pitch and volume and kind of trying to create the illusion that you're doing separate notes ,COMMA when really it's continuously going .PERIOD <BREAK>
Maybe we'll go into the next tune ,COMMA because I totally lost where this is going .PERIOD <BREAK>
It was invented around the 1920 s ,COMMA and the inventor ,COMMA Léon Theremin -- he also was a musician besides an inventor -- he came up with the idea for making the theremin ,COMMA I think ,COMMA when he was working on some shortwave radios .PERIOD <BREAK>
And then also ,COMMA you're trying to stay very ,COMMA very ,COMMA very still because little movements with other parts of your body will affect the pitch ,COMMA or sometimes if you're holding a low note -- -- and breathing will make it .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it's meant to kind of reflect how we engage with histories or stories on the Internet ,COMMA in a less linear form .PERIOD <BREAK>
He was sent in 1907 to Palestine by the Zionist organization to look at areas for Jewish settlement and acquire land for Jewish settlement .PERIOD <BREAK>
During the course of this trial ,COMMA all of the rabbits died ,COMMA except for a few ,COMMA which were euthanized .PERIOD <BREAK>
So when you look at a detail of this work ,COMMA you can see ,COMMA the man on the upper-left is the father of the woman sitting next to him .PERIOD <BREAK>
During the time I was in Bosnia ,COMMA the mortal remains of Zumra's eldest son were exhumed from a mass grave .PERIOD <BREAK>
However ,COMMA the other individuals are represented by these blue slides ,COMMA which show tooth and bone samples that were matched to DNA evidence collected from family members to prove they were the identities of those individuals .PERIOD <BREAK>
There's also parents who participated who wouldn't let their children participate because they thought they were too young to decide for themselves .PERIOD <BREAK>
It was released in Poland to create friction between Frank and Hitler ,COMMA so that Hitler would imagine Frank was trying to usurp his power .PERIOD <BREAK>
Again ,COMMA talking about fate ,COMMA I was interested in the stories and fate of particular works of art .PERIOD <BREAK>
Chapter 12 highlights people being born into a battle that is not of their making ,COMMA but becomes their own .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'm not quite sure whether I really want to see a snare drum at nine o'clock or so in the morning .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it sounds quite simple ,COMMA but actually it's quite a big ,COMMA big job .PERIOD <BREAK>
I will follow the instructions ,COMMA the tempo markings ,COMMA the dynamics .PERIOD <BREAK>
But here I'm being told that the piece of music is very quick .PERIOD <BREAK>
Just the basic feeling .PERIOD <BREAK>
We have to listen to ourselves ,COMMA first of all .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I just feel ,COMMA at last ,COMMA one with the stick and one with the drum .PERIOD <BREAK>
Not just translate them ,COMMA but interpret them .PERIOD <BREAK>
can be felt with just the tiniest part of your finger ,COMMA there .PERIOD <BREAK>
Every single one of us ,COMMA depending on where we're sitting ,COMMA will experience this sound quite ,COMMA quite differently .PERIOD <BREAK>
Do you see what I mean ?QUESTIONMARK So ,COMMA because of this explosion in access to sound ,COMMA especially through the deaf community ,COMMA this has not only affected how music institutions ,COMMA how schools for the deaf treat sound -- and not just as a means of therapy -- although of course ,COMMA being a participator of music ,COMMA that definitely is the case as well .PERIOD <BREAK>
May be great there ,COMMA but terrible up there .PERIOD <BREAK>
We just -- we go like that ,COMMA and we imagine that that's what deafness is about .PERIOD <BREAK>
In a year's time ,COMMA it could be two extra steps .PERIOD <BREAK>
For me ,COMMA as a musician who deals with 99 percent of new music ,COMMA it's very easy for me to say ,COMMA Oh yes ,COMMA I like that piece .PERIOD <BREAK>
Oh no ,COMMA I don't like that piece .PERIOD And so on .PERIOD <BREAK>
And please try to create that through your clapping .PERIOD Try .PERIOD Just -- please try .PERIOD <BREAK>
Very good !EXCLAMATIONMARK Snow .PERIOD Snow .PERIOD Have you ever heard snow ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Evelyn Glennie :COLON Well then ,COMMA stop clapping .PERIOD Try again .PERIOD <BREAK>
See ,COMMA you're awake .PERIOD <BREAK>
However ,COMMA not one of you got out of your seats to think ,COMMA Right !EXCLAMATIONMARK How can I clap ?QUESTIONMARK OK ,COMMA maybe .PERIOD <BREAK>
I may feel sorrowful ,COMMA or happy ,COMMA or exhilarated ,COMMA or angry when I play certain pieces of music ,COMMA but I'm not necessarily wanting you to feel exactly the same thing .PERIOD <BREAK>
The performer is in the worst possible position for the actual sound ,COMMA because they're hearing the contact of the stick on the drum ,COMMA or the mallet on the bit of wood ,COMMA or the bow on the string ,COMMA etc ,COMMA or the breath that's creating the sound from wind and brass .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's a video game move from Star Fox .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we've gone from one board to 48 boards .PERIOD <BREAK>
What the site's known for ,COMMA because it has this environment ,COMMA is it's fostered the creation of a lot of Internet phenomena ,COMMA viral videos and whatnot ,COMMA known as memes .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so there are three that I want to show you specifically .PERIOD <BREAK>
It is where a third of all the traffic is going .PERIOD <BREAK>
They got it taken offline and managed to piss off part of the Internet .PERIOD <BREAK>
So we've got this activist group that's this grassroots group that's come out of the site .PERIOD <BREAK>
Dusty is the name that we've given to this cat .PERIOD <BREAK>
We're sacrificing a lot of that ,COMMA and I think in doing so ,COMMA moving towards those things ,COMMA we're losing something valuable .PERIOD <BREAK>
You're lucky that this is not being streamed to them live right now .PERIOD <BREAK>
Well ,COMMA you never know .PERIOD Some of them -- we've got people in 75 countries out there watching .PERIOD <BREAK>
Don't tell .PERIOD <BREAK>
And saying whatever you like ,COMMA I think ,COMMA is powerful .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the thing is ,COMMA I didn't make it into that presentation because I can't read to you anything that they said ,COMMA more or less .PERIOD <BREAK>
Okay ,COMMA well .PERIOD <BREAK>
You've got this surprising semi-underground influence ,COMMA but it's not making you a lot of money ,COMMA yet .PERIOD <BREAK>
Yeah .PERIOD They still didn't know what to think of that though .PERIOD <BREAK>
Within five ,COMMA 10 million years of the bolide impact we had a whole variety of animals going into the water .PERIOD Why didn't they do that ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
You want to measure it by diversity ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
This slide was shown before .PERIOD This is the famous Jurassic bird Archaeopteryx .PERIOD <BREAK>
If we could roll that first video clip .PERIOD <BREAK>
But one with an immense chalkboard in the middle ,COMMA with lots of little areas of dinosaur rock if you could survive an expedition .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the kinds of teams they bring in ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
So ,COMMA you are finding yourself also in an amazing cultural milieu .PERIOD <BREAK>
You're really rubbing shoulders with the world's last great nomadic people .PERIOD <BREAK>
Here's the animal that was causing it trouble .PERIOD <BREAK>
It is an incredible view of life ,COMMA and it really began when we began to understand the depth of time .PERIOD <BREAK>
We prototyped by CAT-scanning the brain out of this animal .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA this field is just -- and ,COMMA of course ,COMMA science in general -- is just -- adventure .PERIOD <BREAK>
Narrator :COLON If they can just land it ,COMMA this croc will provide useful data ,COMMA helping Paul in his quest to understand Sarcosuchus .PERIOD <BREAK>
I've got it .PERIOD I've got the back legs .PERIOD <BREAK>
Paul Sereno :COLON Let's get this tape measure on him .PERIOD Put it right there .PERIOD <BREAK>
Wow .PERIOD <BREAK>
Anyway ,COMMA you find other things ,COMMA too .PERIOD <BREAK>
These are all landlubbing animals .PERIOD There's a couple of choices .PERIOD <BREAK>
And you take those four instances and you realize you have a complex problem .PERIOD <BREAK>
They did it within two or three degrees of the pole ,COMMA to maintain similarity between continents .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now we have divergence over time ,COMMA but we've created the third dimension of area .PERIOD <BREAK>
I was a total failure in school ,COMMA not really headed to graduate high school .PERIOD <BREAK>
What about all the kids like me that were in school -- kids like some of you out there -- that were in school and didn't get a chance and will never get a chance to participate in science and technology ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Because when you go out there as a scholar ,COMMA and you try to find out longitudinal studies ,COMMA track records like that ,COMMA there essentially are very few ,COMMA if none .PERIOD <BREAK>
Thank you very much .PERIOD <BREAK>
And as a little girl ,COMMA I loved the idea of a robot that interacted with us much more like a helpful ,COMMA trusted sidekick -- something that would delight us ,COMMA enrich our lives and help us save a galaxy or two .PERIOD <BREAK>
I almost lost it this week .PERIOD <BREAK>
Leo ,COMMA this is Cookie Monster .PERIOD <BREAK>
We looked at psychological involvement -- how much empathy did you feel for the other person ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
We looked at their desire to cooperate .PERIOD <BREAK>
Today we know that families are living further and further apart ,COMMA and that definitely takes a toll on family relationships and family bonds over distance .PERIOD <BREAK>
And as grandma-bot ,COMMA she can now play ,COMMA really play ,COMMA with my sons ,COMMA with her grandsons ,COMMA in the real world with his real toys .PERIOD <BREAK>
Another was a computer that ran the same touch-screen interface ,COMMA ran exactly the same dialogues .PERIOD <BREAK>
The quality of advice was identical .PERIOD <BREAK>
We've invited a lot of kids into this space ,COMMA and they think it's pretty cool .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's her competition .PERIOD <BREAK>
Paula Radcliffe ,COMMA the one person who is sure to snatch the big paycheck out of Derartu Tulu's under-underdog hands ,COMMA suddenly grabs her leg and starts to fall back .PERIOD <BREAK>
They're not doing 26 miles ;SEMICOLON they're doing 100 ,COMMA 150 miles at a time ,COMMA and apparently without injury ,COMMA without problems .PERIOD <BREAK>
And if you know it ,COMMA then you are smarter than anybody else on planet Earth .PERIOD <BREAK>
Australopithecus had a tiny little pea brain .PERIOD <BREAK>
The only problem is ,COMMA the first edged weapons only appeared about 200000 years ago .PERIOD <BREAK>
We're not fast .PERIOD <BREAK>
Her uterus would be torn .PERIOD <BREAK>
Then you go beyond 26 miles ,COMMA into the distance that medical science also told us would be fatal to humans -- remember Pheidippides died when he ran 26 miles -- you get to 50 and 100 miles ,COMMA and suddenly it's a different game .PERIOD <BREAK>
Well Emily Baer -- 500 runners -- she finishes in eighth place ,COMMA in the top 10 ,COMMA even though she stopped at all the aid stations to breastfeed her baby during the race -- and yet ,COMMA beat 492 other people .PERIOD <BREAK>
And you'll get slower and slower ,COMMA until eventually you're back to running the same speed you were at age 19 .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now I defy you to come up with any other physical activity -- and please don't say golf -- something that actually is hard -- where geriatrics are performing as well as they did as teenagers .PERIOD <BREAK>
Maybe we evolved as a hunting pack animal .PERIOD <BREAK>
Well if that's true ,COMMA a couple other things had to be true as well .PERIOD <BREAK>
The key to being part of a hunting pack is the word pack .PERIOD <BREAK>
You need to have those 27 -year-old studs at the peak of their powers ready to drop the kill ,COMMA and you need to have those teenagers there who are learning the whole thing all involved .PERIOD <BREAK>
You can't be hauling all your crap around ,COMMA trying to chase the antelope .PERIOD <BREAK>
He pissed me off .PERIOD Let him go chase his own antelope .PERIOD <BREAK>
Geronimo used to say that ,COMMA My only friends are my legs .PERIOD I only trust my legs .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's because an Apache triathlon used to be you'd run 50 miles across the desert ,COMMA engage in hand-to-hand combat ,COMMA steal a bunch of horses and slap leather for home .PERIOD <BREAK>
I didn't do yoga .PERIOD I'm not ready .PERIOD <BREAK>
So hopefully it's something we can all benefit from .PERIOD <BREAK>
I show a number of photographs and films ,COMMA but I also make television programs ,COMMA books and some advertising ,COMMA all with the same concept .PERIOD <BREAK>
I was fascinated by this phenomenon ,COMMA so I wondered :COLON could one erase the image of Diana ,COMMA actually quite crudely and physically ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Momentum was being built .PERIOD <BREAK>
I then went on wondering whether I could actually replace her image ,COMMA so I got a look-alike of Diana and posed her in the right positions and angles and created something that was in ,COMMA or existed in ,COMMA the public imagination .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA this is an image of Diana looking at Camilla kissing her husband ,COMMA and this was a sequence of images .PERIOD <BREAK>
All this imagery was creating a lot of fuss and I was cited as a disgusting artist .PERIOD The press were writing about this ,COMMA giving full pages about how terrible this was .PERIOD <BREAK>
But then this changed suddenly .PERIOD <BREAK>
I was sitting next to someone at dinner the other day ,COMMA and they were saying there's this great image of the Queen sitting outside William Hill .PERIOD <BREAK>
I explored with actually dressing up as the celebrities myself .PERIOD <BREAK>
And me as the Queen .PERIOD <BREAK>
I then continued on to make a whole body of work about Marilyn -- the biggest icon of all -- and trying to titillate by shooting through doorways and shutters and so on and so forth ,COMMA and only showing certain angles to create a reality that ,COMMA obviously ,COMMA is completely constructed .PERIOD <BREAK>
I did an advertising campaign for Schweppes ,COMMA which is Coca-Cola ,COMMA and so that was very interesting in terms of the legalities .PERIOD <BREAK>
Tony Blair and Cherie .PERIOD And again ,COMMA the legalities -- we had to be very careful .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the press were interviewing ,COMMA and I was signing my book .PERIOD <BREAK>
And in fact ,COMMA George Bush and Tony Blair are having great fun during all of this .PERIOD <BREAK>
So there was a lot of meaning in my life because I was performing this type of research during the day .PERIOD <BREAK>
My left hemisphere -- our left hemisphere -- is a very different place .PERIOD <BREAK>
Our left hemisphere is all about the past and it's all about the future .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's that ongoing brain chatter that connects me and my internal world to my external world .PERIOD <BREAK>
I become a single solid individual ,COMMA separate from the energy flow around me and separate from you .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I looked down at my body and I thought ,COMMA Whoa ,COMMA I'm a weird-looking thing .PERIOD And it was as though my consciousness had shifted away from my normal perception of reality ,COMMA where I'm the person on the machine having the experience ,COMMA to some esoteric space where I'm witnessing myself having this experience .PERIOD <BREAK>
I can't define where I begin and where I end ,COMMA because the atoms and the molecules of my arm blended with the atoms and molecules of the wall .PERIOD <BREAK>
And then I would wait for what I call a wave of clarity .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so I say to him -- clear in my mind ,COMMA I say to him :COLON This is Jill !EXCLAMATIONMARK I need help !EXCLAMATIONMARK <BREAK>
Nirvana .PERIOD I found Nirvana .PERIOD And I remember thinking ,COMMA there's no way I would ever be able to squeeze the enormousness of myself back inside this tiny little body .PERIOD <BREAK>
Two and a half weeks after the hemorrhage ,COMMA the surgeons went in and they removed a blood clot the size of a golf ball that was pushing on my language centers .PERIOD <BREAK>
I believe that the more time we spend choosing to run the deep inner-peace circuitry of our right hemispheres ,COMMA the more peace we will project into the world ,COMMA and the more peaceful our planet will be .PERIOD <BREAK>
In Africa -- where it is a major killer -- it is totally ignored .PERIOD <BREAK>
No ,COMMA you will die .PERIOD 50 percent will die within 24 hours ,COMMA if not treated .PERIOD <BREAK>
If you cannot secure the parents ,COMMA you cannot guarantee the security of the African child .PERIOD <BREAK>
These are just for information :COLON hypertension ,COMMA diabetes ,COMMA obesity ,COMMA lack of exercise .PERIOD The usual suspects .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA they spend their money trying to fix those problems .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA for a radiopharmaceutical in the US .PERIOD -- that you'll get a unit dose for 250 dollars -- when we're finished manufacturing it in-house ,COMMA we come at a price of about two dollars .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is at the Heart Institute .PERIOD The doctors from anywhere can log in .PERIOD <BREAK>
They'll give me that information ,COMMA and we'll make the care of the patient better .PERIOD <BREAK>
Because if you can't get it in Nashville ,COMMA you can travel to Birmingham ,COMMA two hours away ,COMMA and you'll get it .PERIOD If you can't get it in Cleveland ,COMMA you can go to Cincinnati .PERIOD We don't have that luxury ,COMMA so we have to make it happen .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA we emphasize training .PERIOD Training is critical .PERIOD <BREAK>
Sharon Lazarus :COLON I am an echocardiographer at the Heart Institute of the Caribbean ,COMMA since the past two years .PERIOD I received training at this institution .PERIOD <BREAK>
I think I'll start out and just talk a little bit about what exactly autism is .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'm really concerned that a lot of the schools have taken out the hands-on classes ,COMMA because art ,COMMA and classes like that ,COMMA those are the classes where I excelled .PERIOD <BREAK>
I thought everybody thought in pictures .PERIOD <BREAK>
OK ,COMMA there is my childhood church ,COMMA that's specific .PERIOD There's some more ,COMMA Fort Collins .PERIOD <BREAK>
But one of the things that really worries me is :COLON Where's the younger version of those kids going today ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And then there's a verbal mind ,COMMA they know every fact about everything .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I came in half an hour beforehand so I could have it put on and kind of get used to it ,COMMA and they got it bent so it's not hitting my chin .PERIOD <BREAK>
Because think about it :COLON An animal is a sensory-based thinker ,COMMA not verbal -- thinks in pictures ,COMMA thinks in sounds ,COMMA thinks in smells .PERIOD <BREAK>
Are they friend or foe ?QUESTIONMARK Is there anybody he can go mate with ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
There's a ton of information on that fire hydrant .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA this ability to put information into categories ,COMMA I find a lot of people are not very good at this .PERIOD <BREAK>
I find a lot of people have difficulty doing that .PERIOD <BREAK>
Is it a minor problem ,COMMA with something simple I can fix ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Yeah ,COMMA I'm a million-mile flyer .PERIOD <BREAK>
I do lots and lots of flying ,COMMA and if I was at the FAA ,COMMA what would I be doing a lot of direct observation of ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
It would be their airplane tails .PERIOD <BREAK>
I was a goofball student .PERIOD When I was in high school I just didn't care at all about studying ,COMMA until I had Mr .PERIOD Carlock's science class .PERIOD <BREAK>
And they're not going down the right path .PERIOD <BREAK>
But you know what ?QUESTIONMARK I was getting work experience .PERIOD <BREAK>
In other words ,COMMA use that fixation in order to motivate that kid ,COMMA that's one of the things we need to do .PERIOD <BREAK>
The pattern thinkers ,COMMA they're the ones that are going to be your mathematicians ,COMMA your software engineers ,COMMA your computer programmers ,COMMA all of those kinds of jobs .PERIOD <BREAK>
Because the thing about being autistic is ,COMMA I had to learn social skills like being in a play .PERIOD <BREAK>
I cannot emphasize enough what my science teacher did for me .PERIOD <BREAK>
Well ,COMMA first of all ,COMMA you've got to look at age .PERIOD <BREAK>
How many cattle got poked with the prodder ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Temple ,COMMA can I just say it's an absolute delight to have you at TED .PERIOD <BREAK>
Okay .PERIOD <BREAK>
Bye-bye .PERIOD <BREAK>
When they were a bunch of kids ,COMMA they were kind of very imaginative ,COMMA very adventurous ,COMMA as they were trying at Caltech to mix chemicals and see which one blows up more .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA that's what we call our first five employees during the tea break ,COMMA you know ,COMMA in here .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that was done over a period of a couple of years ,COMMA and now we are the leading organization ,COMMA you know ,COMMA exploring space on all of your behalf .PERIOD <BREAK>
But even when we did that ,COMMA we had to remind ourselves ,COMMA sometimes there are setbacks .PERIOD <BREAK>
But then also ,COMMA just to celebrate that ,COMMA we started an event at JPL for Miss Guided Missile .PERIOD <BREAK>
Maybe they're right - I doubt it .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA next time you are really depressed ,COMMA look in the mirror and you can look and say ,COMMA hi ,COMMA I'm looking at a star here .PERIOD <BREAK>
So it is a dynamic planet ,COMMA and activity is going on as we speak today .PERIOD <BREAK>
As I told you ,COMMA geologists love craters .PERIOD <BREAK>
If you were there you wouldn't do it yourself .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that's what we found out .PERIOD It turned out that every once in a while there are dust devils which come by on Mars ,COMMA as you are seeing here ,COMMA and when the dust devil comes over the Rover ,COMMA it just cleans it up .PERIOD <BREAK>
Yeah !EXCLAMATIONMARK <BREAK>
It's the first mission that's going to try to land near the North Pole of Mars ,COMMA and it's the first mission that's actually going to try and reach out and touch water on the surface of another planet .PERIOD <BREAK>
The outside can get almost as hot as the surface of the Sun .PERIOD <BREAK>
The temperature of the heat shield can reach 2600 degrees Fahrenheit .PERIOD <BREAK>
The fabric and the stitching could just pull apart .PERIOD <BREAK>
We kick them ,COMMA we hit them ,COMMA we drop them ,COMMA just to make sure we understand how ,COMMA where would they break .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I know many of you ,COMMA kind of ,COMMA last time afterwards said well ,COMMA that was a cool thing to have -- those airbags .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's real stuff .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA the idea is ,COMMA by watching Saturn we're actually watching our solar system in real time being formed on a smaller scale ,COMMA so it's like a test bed for it .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA you think that those rings are very large objects .PERIOD <BREAK>
That was [unclear] also -- you know ,COMMA because we were worried about the risk of it ,COMMA but it worked pretty well .PERIOD <BREAK>
So people believe now that Titan is most likely what we call a pre-biotic planet ,COMMA because it's so cold organic material did not get to the stage of becoming biological material ,COMMA and therefore life could have evolved on it .PERIOD <BREAK>
So here we have a cycle of a planet which is like our Earth ,COMMA but is all made of ethane and methane and organic material .PERIOD <BREAK>
And being the current day ,COMMA of course ,COMMA we started our own Facebook group .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now why am I telling you this story ,COMMA and what does this have to do with the future of health ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
What I'd like to talk about today is understanding these exponential technologies .PERIOD <BREAK>
And coming up next month is actually Future Med ,COMMA a program to help cross-train and leverage technologies into medicine .PERIOD <BREAK>
These mobile phones have over 20000 different mobile apps available -- to the point where there's one out of the UK .PERIOD <BREAK>
Let's start with faster .PERIOD <BREAK>
We can look inside with real time fMRI -- in the brain at real time .PERIOD <BREAK>
The scan in a couple of years will be one terabyte ,COMMA or 800000 books .PERIOD <BREAK>
And now ,COMMA of course ,COMMA we're in the era of the iPad ,COMMA even the iPad 2 .PERIOD <BREAK>
The ability to interact with your health care provider is different .PERIOD <BREAK>
Consumers now can buy basically hundred-dollar devices ,COMMA like this little FitBit .PERIOD <BREAK>
So a few examples :COLON we're now in the era of Fantastic Voyage ,COMMA the iPill .PERIOD <BREAK>
And this is really going to leverage technology to the rural and the under-served and enable what used to be thousand-dollar tests to be done at pennies and at the point of care .PERIOD <BREAK>
My data indicates that I've got about average risk for developing macular degeneration ,COMMA a kind of blindness .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'm at almost twice the risk for Type II diabetes .PERIOD <BREAK>
It might change my behavior .PERIOD <BREAK>
We can capture that information .PERIOD <BREAK>
This has been called by Lee Hood ,COMMA the father of the field ,COMMA P 4 medicine .PERIOD <BREAK>
How about more targeted therapies for cancer ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Now I'll close with regenerative medicine .PERIOD <BREAK>
Geron ,COMMA just last year ,COMMA started the first trial using human embryonic stem cells to treat spinal cord injuries .PERIOD <BREAK>
Still a Phase I trial ,COMMA but evolving .PERIOD <BREAK>
I thought I would read poems I have that relate to the subject of youth and age .PERIOD <BREAK>
My grandmother is washing my mouth out with soap ;SEMICOLON half a long century gone and still she comes at me with that thick cruel yellow bar .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's a longer poem .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's called The Neighbor .PERIOD <BREAK>
Her shadow once ,COMMA fumbling the chain on her door ,COMMA then the door slamming fearfully shut ,COMMA only the barking and the music -- jazz -- filtering as it does ,COMMA day and night into the hall .PERIOD <BREAK>
My thinking we'd meet ,COMMA recognize one another ,COMMA become friends ,COMMA that I'd accomplish a penance .PERIOD <BREAK>
Sometimes there are frightening goings-on in the stairwell .PERIOD <BREAK>
Medea she was ,COMMA next time I saw her .PERIOD <BREAK>
My holding the door .PERIOD <BREAK>
Instead ,COMMA I'd step into my train .PERIOD <BREAK>
The dance of our glances ,COMMA the clash ,COMMA pulling each other through our perceptual punctures ,COMMA then holocaust ,COMMA holocaust ,COMMA host on host of ill ,COMMA injured presences ,COMMA squandered ,COMMA consumed .PERIOD <BREAK>
The dance of our glances ,COMMA challenge ,COMMA abdication ,COMMA effacement ,COMMA the perfume of our consternation .PERIOD <BREAK>
Forever .PERIOD With grace .PERIOD <BREAK>
But I'm afraid that Ricky will come out here and shake his fist at me .PERIOD <BREAK>
Special :COLON big tits ,COMMA Says the advertisement for a soft-core magazine on our neighborhood newsstand .PERIOD <BREAK>
But forget her breasts .PERIOD <BREAK>
The display was a photo .PERIOD Men and women stripped naked ,COMMA some trying to cover their genitals ,COMMA others too frightened to bother ,COMMA lined up in snow waiting to be shot and thrown into a ditch .PERIOD <BREAK>
What carnal mistrust had their teacher taught them .PERIOD <BREAK>
The truth is that we know that the images themselves don't change the world ,COMMA but we're also aware that ,COMMA since the beginning of photography ,COMMA images have provoked reactions in people ,COMMA and those reactions have caused change to happen .PERIOD <BREAK>
It changed our view of the physical world .PERIOD <BREAK>
Some would argue that it is those images that did more to fuel the insurgency in Iraq than virtually any other single act .PERIOD <BREAK>
In fact ,COMMA these images became the voices of protest themselves .PERIOD <BREAK>
I was the only human being in an area one-and-a-half times the size of America ,COMMA five-and-a-half thousand square miles .PERIOD <BREAK>
Ben ,COMMA I've read somewhere that at minus 40 ,COMMA exposed skin becomes frostbitten in less than a minute ,COMMA so how do you answer the call of nature ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Third one :COLON how do you top that ?QUESTIONMARK What's next ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
I was 23 years old .PERIOD No one my age had attempted anything like this ,COMMA and pretty quickly ,COMMA almost everything that could have gone wrong did go wrong .PERIOD <BREAK>
I had frostbite in my left big toe .PERIOD <BREAK>
You can just see -- there's a nine and a string of zeros here .PERIOD <BREAK>
I dialed three numbers .PERIOD I dialed my mum .PERIOD <BREAK>
The -- the whole world underneath me .PERIOD <BREAK>
There are huge areas of open water just south of your position .PERIOD <BREAK>
Antarctica ,COMMA if you include the ice shelves ,COMMA is twice the size of Australia -- it's a big place .PERIOD <BREAK>
And they turned around ,COMMA headed back to the coast ,COMMA and all five of them died on the return journey .PERIOD <BREAK>
Where was this guilt trip coming from ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
There was one person in the group that was supposed to have very high performance that was actually performing terribly .PERIOD <BREAK>
And he pulled the whole mean down ,COMMA destroying my statistical significance of the test .PERIOD <BREAK>
So I looked carefully at this guy .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I'm sure that it's something that we all recognize ,COMMA and we see that it happens .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that's a much ,COMMA much more difficult lesson to take into account .PERIOD <BREAK>
In my mind ,COMMA I was actually a knight trying to help science move along .PERIOD <BREAK>
I mean ,COMMA this is all very depressing ,COMMA right -- people have conflicts of interest ,COMMA we don't see it ,COMMA and so on .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is actually a direct quote from an epidemiologist who's been in field of HIV for 15 years ,COMMA worked on four continents ,COMMA and you're looking at her .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so everyone lined up ,COMMA all the smackheads in a row ,COMMA and the guy whose birthday it was filled up the fit ,COMMA and he went down and started injecting people .PERIOD <BREAK>
So his choice was either to accept that dirty needle or not to get high .PERIOD <BREAK>
So what's that about ?QUESTIONMARK Is it like you get a better high if you share or something ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
So she was making a politically rational decision .PERIOD <BREAK>
I've always been a bit curious about that because I think stigma is a bad thing ,COMMA whereas lots of sex is quite a good thing ,COMMA but we'll leave that be .PERIOD <BREAK>
Of course ,COMMA you can't get HIV just by having unprotected sex .PERIOD <BREAK>
And ,COMMA again ,COMMA it's because of an alignment of the incentives .PERIOD <BREAK>
And ,COMMA actually ,COMMA clients don't want to go home with a drip either .PERIOD <BREAK>
He's from Haiti and he has AIDS .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the other thing is that people are simply not as scared of HIV as they were of AIDS ,COMMA and rightly so .PERIOD <BREAK>
We've got the tools ,COMMA the knowledge and the cash ,COMMA and commitment to preventing HIV too .PERIOD <BREAK>
There are as many different ways of being rational as there are human beings on the planet ,COMMA and that's one of the glories of human existence .PERIOD <BREAK>
Ten years ago exactly ,COMMA I was in Afghanistan .PERIOD <BREAK>
Would you like to see civil war ,COMMA sectarian killing ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
They found something called Facebook .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is what they were telling .PERIOD This is their propaganda .PERIOD <BREAK>
And this is how the revolution was born in Tunisia .PERIOD <BREAK>
But we found that these people in the street ,COMMA all of them are our reporters ,COMMA feeding our newsroom with pictures ,COMMA with videos and with news .PERIOD <BREAK>
We are going to be the voice for these voiceless people .PERIOD <BREAK>
Be aware of these people who [are] coming to you in order to ruin your great civilization .PERIOD <BREAK>
They have been detached from their people ,COMMA from the masses ,COMMA and now we are seeing them collapsing one after the other .PERIOD <BREAK>
I felt the responsibility to phone our correspondents there and to phone our newsroom and to tell them ,COMMA Make your best not to switch off the cameras at night ,COMMA because the guys there really feel confident when someone is reporting their story -- and they feel protected as well .PERIOD <BREAK>
We have a chance to go and to think of the future as something which is open to the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
Let us free ourselves -- especially in the West -- from thinking about that part of the world based on oil interest ,COMMA or based on interests of the illusion of stability and security .PERIOD <BREAK>
Is this a story-of-the-year ,COMMA a story-of-the-decade or something more ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
In my opinion ,COMMA these people are much more wiser than ,COMMA not only the political elite ,COMMA even the intellectual elite ,COMMA even opposition leaders including political parties .PERIOD <BREAK>
Thank you so much .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I'm going to have Michael Manring play bass with me .PERIOD <BREAK>

Hey ,COMMA hey ,COMMA hey ,COMMA hey .PERIOD Hey ,COMMA hey ,COMMA black-eyed Susie ,COMMA hey !EXCLAMATIONMARK <BREAK>

I fell in love with that .PERIOD <BREAK>
The Old Jack tales that he had learned -- he talked like this ,COMMA you could hardly understand him .PERIOD But it was really wonderful .PERIOD <BREAK>
It was hard on the cats ,COMMA but it made a great little instrument .PERIOD <BREAK>
And if you don't know what you're doing ,COMMA your hands are bleeding in no time .PERIOD <BREAK>
Good news :COLON Chariot's coming .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I don't want it to leave me behind .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA my mother hoped that we learned from that the value of hard work .PERIOD <BREAK>
No ,COMMA we learned something else .PERIOD <BREAK>
The first thing I learned that day was that I never ever wanted to work that hard again .PERIOD <BREAK>
But that day in the cotton field out there picking ,COMMA when those people started singing ,COMMA I realized I was in the very heart of real music ,COMMA and that's where I've wanted to be ever since .PERIOD <BREAK>
Good news :COLON Chariot's coming .PERIOD <BREAK>
It was a few years ago ,COMMA but I sort of remembered this story ,COMMA and I told it at a concert .PERIOD <BREAK>
My mom was in the audience .PERIOD <BREAK>
I just wanted you boys to learn the value of hard work .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I don't want it to leave me behind .PERIOD <BREAK>
I just break off another bottleneck and play these steel guitar blues .PERIOD <BREAK>
They were about my age .PERIOD <BREAK>
It had three chemicals we were really surprised to see :COLON sulfur ,COMMA potassium nitrate and charcoal .PERIOD <BREAK>
We tore everything down and buried it in his backyard .PERIOD <BREAK>
We have about 120 million dollars ,COMMA and we want to do it well .PERIOD <BREAK>
The first thing that anybody who knows science ,COMMA and has been around science ,COMMA is that the stuff you learn in school as a scientific method is wrong .PERIOD There is no method .PERIOD <BREAK>
I’m not going to read them all to you because I’m not in teacher mode .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I want to talk about three stages in that evolution .PERIOD <BREAK>
In that year ,COMMA we are not available for any of our clients .PERIOD <BREAK>
We are totally closed .PERIOD <BREAK>
Quite the similar idea ,COMMA then ,COMMA a perfume packaged in a book ,COMMA in a die cut .PERIOD <BREAK>
I likely already look forward to the weekend on Thursdays .PERIOD <BREAK>
Europe and the US .PERIOD didn't really feel enticing because I knew them too well .PERIOD So Asia it was .PERIOD <BREAK>
So I looked for furniture .PERIOD <BREAK>
So one of the things that we pursued in Bali was pieces of furniture .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I think by the time this lamp came about ,COMMA I had finally made peace with those dogs .PERIOD <BREAK>
I also started meditating for the first time in my life in Bali .PERIOD <BREAK>
His latest numbers are fairly impressive .PERIOD <BREAK>
So I became my own intern .PERIOD <BREAK>
I had fun .PERIOD <BREAK>
Financially ,COMMA seen over the long term ,COMMA it was actually successful .PERIOD <BREAK>
We were asked to design an identity for Casa da Musica ,COMMA the Rem Koolhaas-built music center in Porto ,COMMA in Portugal .PERIOD <BREAK>
It has a more transparent identity .PERIOD <BREAK>
Some of you might have seen it .PERIOD <BREAK>
So after eight hours that's pretty much all that was left of the whole thing .PERIOD <BREAK>
So I'll just give you my message up front :COLON Try not to go extinct .PERIOD <BREAK>
People ask me a lot -- in fact ,COMMA one of the most asked questions I get is ,COMMA why do children like dinosaurs so much ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Every museum wanted a little bigger or better one than anybody else had .PERIOD <BREAK>
So everyone was out looking for all these bigger and better dinosaurs .PERIOD <BREAK>
And they thought about it and they even wrote papers about it :COLON Where are the little dinosaurs ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
First off ,COMMA scientists have egos ,COMMA and scientists like to name dinosaurs .PERIOD <BREAK>
So this is where people went astray again .PERIOD <BREAK>
But I have a museum and I collect dinosaurs and I can saw mine open .PERIOD <BREAK>
And if you cut into an older dinosaur ,COMMA it's very massive .PERIOD <BREAK>
So here's a dinosaur that has spikes sticking out of its head ,COMMA no dome and gnarly stuff on its nose .PERIOD <BREAK>
Nobody noticed the gnarly stuff sort of looked alike .PERIOD <BREAK>
Dracorex is the littlest one ,COMMA Stygimoloch is the middle size one ,COMMA Pachycephalosaurus is the largest one .PERIOD <BREAK>
But it didn't give them a clue .PERIOD <BREAK>
So we have a whole bunch of them at our museum .PERIOD <BREAK>
And then as they grow older ,COMMA the horns grow forward .PERIOD <BREAK>
If you look along the edge of the frill ,COMMA they have these little triangular bones that actually grow big as triangles and then they flatten against the frill pretty much like the spikes do on the Pachycephalosaurs .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we get rid of Anatotitan .PERIOD <BREAK>
So again ,COMMA real easy to say that Tyrannosaurus ontogeny included Nanotyrannus ,COMMA and therefore we can take out another dinosaur .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now as you can imagine ,COMMA this is not very popular with fourth-graders .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is Soft Sell for 42 nd Street .PERIOD <BREAK>
They weren't doing their primary work ,COMMA which was for the government ,COMMA while they were helping us with this .PERIOD <BREAK>
And many musicians choose to use the theater glass walls totally open .PERIOD <BREAK>
Chamber and the notion of chamber has to do with salons and small-scale performances .PERIOD They asked us to bring an intimacy .PERIOD <BREAK>
And this is a mockup that is in Salt Lake City that gives you a sense of what this is going to look like in full-scale .PERIOD <BREAK>
Chris has been so nice .PERIOD <BREAK>
So nice ,COMMA all week .PERIOD He's the kind of man you could say to ,COMMA Chris ,COMMA I'm really sorry ,COMMA I've crashed your car .PERIOD <BREAK>
And you know that Chris would say ,COMMA Thank you .PERIOD <BREAK>
Emmanuel ?QUESTIONMARK Absolutely .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA that's going to look pretty shabby now .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA what I thought I'd do is -- in honor of Emmanuel -- is ,COMMA what I can do is to launch today the first TED Global auction .PERIOD <BREAK>
And he'll say ,COMMA You're offering me things that are infinitely variable .PERIOD <BREAK>
And she's desperate to find more evidence for the link .PERIOD <BREAK>
This man has swum around the North Pole ,COMMA what more evidence do you want ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
No .PERIOD <BREAK>
Alright ,COMMA it was never exactly 'Brokeback Mountain' You know ,COMMA I wrote to him ,COMMA just before I left office .PERIOD I said ,COMMA 'Can I rely on your support for the next month' And he wrote back .PERIOD He said ,COMMA 'No ,COMMA you can't' Which kind of surprised me ,COMMA because I'd never seen 'can't' spelled that way before .PERIOD <BREAK>
When you think what's happened to financial services ,COMMA and you see what's happened to the economy ,COMMA you think ,COMMA Well ,COMMA there is a man who delivers on his promises .PERIOD <BREAK>
And ,COMMA you know ,COMMA Iceland ,COMMA it was never going to cut it .PERIOD <BREAK>
Luckily ,COMMA somebody like George Bush was really helpful .PERIOD <BREAK>
He summed it up ,COMMA really ,COMMA at a dinner .PERIOD <BREAK>
And then ,COMMA you're now ,COMMA well ,COMMA actually ,COMMA that's what this is about .PERIOD <BREAK>
Well ,COMMA you know I'm sorry about that .PERIOD <BREAK>
And you want a leader who inspires and challenges and makes you want to be a better citizen .PERIOD Right ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
So he comes over to this country ,COMMA and he says ,COMMA We need a big fiscal stimulus .PERIOD <BREAK>
He goes to Prague ,COMMA he says ,COMMA We believe in a nuclear-free world .PERIOD <BREAK>
Do you remember that ?QUESTIONMARK George Bush ,COMMA A nu-ca-ler .PERIOD <BREAK>
who said ,COMMA reach out and touch .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA Nelson ,COMMA how would you like a nice water feature ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And we need six to eight waist-high plants per person .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it has close to 1200 such plants for 300 occupants .PERIOD <BREAK>
Our studies have found that there is a 42 percent probability of one's blood oxygen going up by one percent if one stays indoors in this building for 10 hours .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the study showed that ,COMMA compared to other buildings ,COMMA there is a reduced incidence of eye irritation by 52 percent ,COMMA respiratory systems by 34 percent ,COMMA headaches by 24 percent ,COMMA lung impairment by 12 percent and asthma by nine percent .PERIOD <BREAK>
Why is this important ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
So how do you feel about that -- the whole -- MA :COLON Well ,COMMA it's pretty irritating actually because nobody ever describes what a man is wearing .PERIOD <BREAK>
And no guy ever gets criticized .PERIOD But that's the least of it .PERIOD <BREAK>
How did you handle that balance between being the tough diplomatic and strong voice of this country to the rest of the world and also how you felt about yourself as a mother ,COMMA a grandmother ,COMMA nurturing .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so how did you handle that ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Because in her lifetime -- MA :COLON That would be so .PERIOD <BREAK>
Thank you for joining us today .PERIOD <BREAK>
My little group of molecular programmers are trying to refashion all of these parts from DNA .PERIOD <BREAK>
And if you buy all of this ,COMMA and you think life is about computation ,COMMA as I do ,COMMA then you look at big questions through the eyes of a computer scientist .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is exactly analogous to the question ,COMMA what's the smallest program I can write that will act exactly like Microsoft Word ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And just as he's writing ,COMMA you know ,COMMA bacteria that will be smaller ,COMMA he's writing genomes that will work ,COMMA we could write smaller programs that would do what Microsoft Word does .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA these are big questions in computer science .PERIOD <BREAK>
That holds the long strand like this .PERIOD <BREAK>
I wanted to fold DNA into something that goes up over the eye ,COMMA down the nose ,COMMA up the nose ,COMMA around the forehead ,COMMA back down and end in a little loop like this .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's got a needle ,COMMA like a record needle ,COMMA that goes back and forth over the surface ,COMMA bumps up and down ,COMMA and feels the height of the first surface .PERIOD <BREAK>
She wrote all her own software to design and built this DNA origami ,COMMA a beautiful rendition of China ,COMMA which even has Taiwan ,COMMA and you can see it's sort of on the world's shortest leash ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA this is just a single switch and you need half a billion for a computer ,COMMA so we have a long way to go .PERIOD <BREAK>
The DNA origami is a proof that that compiler actually works .PERIOD <BREAK>
The fact is that it does not scale .PERIOD <BREAK>
So now ,COMMA we can use this counting to try and get at much bigger things than DNA origami could otherwise .PERIOD <BREAK>
You can just change a couple of the DNA strands in this binary representation and you'll get 96 rather than 32 .PERIOD <BREAK>
Here is a DNA origami rectangle ,COMMA and here are some tiles growing from it .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA it turns out we actually had this idea nine years ago ,COMMA and that's about the time constant for how long it takes to do these kinds of things ,COMMA so I think we made a lot of progress .PERIOD <BREAK>
We've got ideas about how to fix these errors .PERIOD <BREAK>
What it's really about is taking computer science and looking at big questions in a new light ,COMMA asking new versions of those big questions and trying to understand how biology can make such amazing things .PERIOD Thank you .PERIOD <BREAK>
Therefore ,COMMA it would be too risky to release these animals ,COMMA both for the released and for the natural populations .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA this is not new ,COMMA people have been doing this around the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA these genes are indeed going back to the populations .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA I say ,COMMA Let's study more ,COMMA let's shed light on this issue ,COMMA let's do whatever we can .PERIOD <BREAK>
This song kind of came out of all of that .PERIOD <BREAK>
We ended up being the first medical response team in every incident location and transported 125 victims ,COMMA saving life .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the other is Moksha-Yug Access ,COMMA which is integrating rural supply chain on the foundations of self-help group-based microfinance .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now I come back to the idea of the new social enterprise that I'm exploring .PERIOD <BREAK>
Often it is the constraining or the back-to-the-wall situation that the hapless common man finds himself or herself in that leads him to pay a bribe .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA let me ask you another question .PERIOD <BREAK>
But you also don't have the time ,COMMA resources ,COMMA expertise or wherewithal to fight this .PERIOD <BREAK>
Like a bribe buster service ,COMMA or 1 - 800 -Fight-Bribes ,COMMA or wwwstopbribesorg or wwwpreventcorruptionorg .PERIOD <BREAK>
I don't want to be haunted by such images any more .PERIOD <BREAK>
A set of people actually say ,COMMA Oh ,COMMA let me just grant it to them ,COMMA and run away from it .PERIOD <BREAK>
But the one thing I want you to notice about them is this :COLON even though this is a very long list ,COMMA there isn't a single thing on it that involves other human beings .PERIOD <BREAK>
And yet ,COMMA when some psychologists interviewed hospital janitors to get a sense of what they thought their jobs were like ,COMMA they encountered Mike ,COMMA who told them about how he stopped mopping the floor because Mr .PERIOD Jones was out of his bed getting a little exercise ,COMMA trying to build up his strength ,COMMA walking slowly up and down the hall .PERIOD <BREAK>
And then there was Luke ,COMMA who washed the floor in a comatose young man's room twice because the man's father ,COMMA who had been keeping a vigil for six months ,COMMA didn't see Luke do it the first time ,COMMA and his father was angry .PERIOD <BREAK>
A wise person knows when and how to make the exception to every rule ,COMMA as the janitors knew when to ignore the job duties in the service of other objectives .PERIOD <BREAK>
A wise person is like a jazz musician -- using the notes on the page ,COMMA but dancing around them ,COMMA inventing combinations that are appropriate for the situation and the people at hand .PERIOD <BREAK>
A wise person knows how to use these moral skills in the service of the right aims .PERIOD <BREAK>
Dad ,COMMA being an academic ,COMMA had no idea that Mike's Hard Lemonade contained alcohol .PERIOD <BREAK>
And they were ready to let the kid go .PERIOD <BREAK>
When things go wrong ,COMMA as of course they do ,COMMA we reach for two tools to try to fix them .PERIOD <BREAK>
Say 75 items in this script to teach a 25 -page picture book .PERIOD <BREAK>
Scripts like these are insurance policies against disaster .PERIOD <BREAK>
Jazz musicians need some notes -- most of them need some notes on the page .PERIOD <BREAK>
We need more rules for the bankers ,COMMA God knows .PERIOD <BREAK>
Some psychologists went around and polled citizens who were very well informed .PERIOD <BREAK>
They said ,COMMA If we paid you six weeks' salary every year would you be willing to have a nuclear waste dump in your community ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
We see this in medicine .PERIOD <BREAK>
I don't know how many of you remember this :COLON another moral hero ,COMMA 15 years ago ,COMMA Aaron Feuerstein ,COMMA who was the head of Malden Mills in Massachusetts -- they made Polartec -- The factory burned down .PERIOD <BREAK>
And a bonus he's discovering is he's actually going to make even more money .PERIOD <BREAK>
In many ways this is the perfect example .PERIOD <BREAK>
So there's a lot here at TED ,COMMA and at other places ,COMMA to celebrate .PERIOD <BREAK>
There are ordinary heroes .PERIOD <BREAK>
Even the wisest and most well-meaning people will give up if they have to swim against the current in the organizations in which they work .PERIOD <BREAK>
And any moral work depends upon practical wisdom .PERIOD <BREAK>
I think there is reason for hope .PERIOD <BREAK>
Thank you .PERIOD <BREAK>
A few years ago I was visited by the guy that runs DARPA ,COMMA the people that fund all the advanced technologies that businesses and universities probably wouldn't take the risk of doing .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now we've got F 18 s and F 22 s ,COMMA and if somebody loses an arm ,COMMA we give them a plastic stick with a hook on it .PERIOD <BREAK>
If it's the raisin ,COMMA they won't drop it .PERIOD <BREAK>
I told them they're nuts .PERIOD <BREAK>
It will take the other nine to make it functional and useful .PERIOD <BREAK>
I went back and I started putting a team together ,COMMA the best guys I could find with a passion to do this .PERIOD <BREAK>
We walked into Walter Reed and I could not have been more wrong .PERIOD <BREAK>
I can give you fast control with low reduction ratios in these gears ,COMMA or I can give you power ;SEMICOLON I can't give you both .PERIOD <BREAK>
I lost my right arm ,COMMA but I'm a lefty .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA we went back .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA we went back ,COMMA and we've been working harder yet .PERIOD <BREAK>
And he was there ,COMMA and they said we needed to come .PERIOD <BREAK>
He's got no arms .PERIOD <BREAK>
Who is going to pay for it ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Those are tough questions .PERIOD <BREAK>
I don't know the answers .PERIOD <BREAK>
What do we need to do ?QUESTIONMARK There's very polarized answers to that question too ,COMMA and I don't have any answers to that .PERIOD <BREAK>
I think eventually we'll make these things extraordinary .PERIOD <BREAK>
And whining and complaining about what our foreign policy ought to be .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we ought to give it to them .PERIOD <BREAK>
That one was way more difficult than I had expected .PERIOD <BREAK>
When the rescue workers came they resuscitated him and there was no brain damage .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA I took that as a challenge ,COMMA basically .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I stayed inside of that water tank hoping my core temperature would start to drop .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA I realized that was completely not going to work .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA I went to talk to a doctor friend ,COMMA and I asked him how could I do that ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Then I actually started thinking about liquid breathing .PERIOD <BREAK>
You blow in and out .PERIOD <BREAK>
And you're really ridding your body of CO 2 .PERIOD <BREAK>
And his total lung capacity is twice the size of an average person .PERIOD <BREAK>
I had to drop 50 pounds in three months .PERIOD <BREAK>
Every bit of food was exactly what it was for its nutritional value .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I started to really adapt my body .PERIOD <BREAK>
I assumed that I could put a water tank at Lincoln center and if I stayed there a week not eating ,COMMA I would get comfortable in that situation and I would slow my metabolism ,COMMA which I was sure would help me hold my breath longer than I had been able to do it .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I thought everything seemed to be on track .PERIOD <BREAK>
And by seven minutes I had gone into these awful convulsions .PERIOD <BREAK>
This was a different record .PERIOD This was a pure O 2 static apnea record that Guinness had set the world record at 13 minutes .PERIOD <BREAK>
A hypoxic tent is a tent that simulates altitude at 15000 feet .PERIOD <BREAK>
But for TV they wanted me to be upright so they could see my face ,COMMA basically .PERIOD <BREAK>
That made me extremely nervous ,COMMA raising the heart rate .PERIOD <BREAK>
And there is no way to slow my heart rate down .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I started having ischemia to the heart .PERIOD <BREAK>
My heartbeat would go from 120 ,COMMA to 50 ,COMMA to 150 ,COMMA to 40 ,COMMA to 20 ,COMMA to 150 again .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA I let my feet out ,COMMA and I started floating to the top .PERIOD <BREAK>
They had doctors with the Pst ,COMMA you know ,COMMA so ,COMMA sitting there waiting .PERIOD <BREAK>
As a magician I try to show things to people that seem impossible .PERIOD <BREAK>
And then he stopped .PERIOD Walking in front of him was her .PERIOD <BREAK>
Sure ,COMMA she had aged a little .PERIOD <BREAK>
Gusty entered her boldly and made love to her rhythmically while she filmed him ,COMMA because she was a keen amateur pornographer .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that provides the ground for a type of action ,COMMA because consensus of each moment allows us to act .PERIOD <BREAK>
We have three critical terms :COLON economy ,COMMA civil society and the state .PERIOD <BREAK>
We propose 10 .PERIOD <BREAK>
The least important form of capital ,COMMA in this project ,COMMA is financial capital -- money .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA the issue that should concern us here -- and that's the challenge that I would like to pose to this group -- is again ,COMMA it takes 16 years in your countries to produce somebody with a BS .PERIOD degree .PERIOD <BREAK>
Every conceivable form of infrastructure had broken down .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA when violence erupts in a country like Afghanistan ,COMMA it's because of that legacy .PERIOD <BREAK>
Look ,COMMA there's a very little known fact :COLON countries that have a legal average income per capita of 1000 dollars don't produce drugs .PERIOD <BREAK>
Cotton does not compete with opium ;SEMICOLON a t-shirt does .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'm all for it ;SEMICOLON after all ,COMMA I raised a lot of it .PERIOD <BREAK>
And then I'll let you in on a secret ,COMMA which is why I am an incurable optimist .PERIOD <BREAK>
Well ,COMMA it's been calculated a few degrees' rise in the earth's temperature would melt the polar ice caps .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the trends for those who are at the periphery of our society ,COMMA who are the poorest and the most vulnerable ,COMMA the trends give rise to a great case for pessimism .PERIOD <BREAK>
It will cause rising seas .PERIOD It will cause saline deposited into wells and into lands .PERIOD <BREAK>
For some ,COMMA it will lead to anger ,COMMA religious and sectarian violence and terrorism .PERIOD <BREAK>
A minimum of 20 to 30 inches of increase in sea levels is the best case that we can hope for ,COMMA and it could be 10 times that .PERIOD <BREAK>
Enough of the bad news .PERIOD Human beings have always risen to the challenge .PERIOD <BREAK>
20 years ago ,COMMA there were three and a half million .PERIOD <BREAK>
This disease is called sudden wealth syndrome .PERIOD <BREAK>
All throughout the technology world ,COMMA we're seeing young people bitten by this disease of sudden wealth syndrome .PERIOD <BREAK>
More reasons to be optimistic :COLON in the ' 60 s ,COMMA and I am a creature of the ' 60 s ,COMMA there was a movement .PERIOD <BREAK>
And on July 7 th ,COMMA around the world ,COMMA I learned only yesterday ,COMMA there will be global Live Earth concerts .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA that doesn't mean that people understand that global warming hurts the poorest and the weakest the most .PERIOD <BREAK>
We visited every house in India ,COMMA searching for smallpox -- 120 million houses ,COMMA once every month ,COMMA for nearly two years .PERIOD <BREAK>
Thank you very much .PERIOD <BREAK>
In the history of our planet ,COMMA there have been three great waves of evolution .PERIOD <BREAK>
But we had to do it the hard way in the old days by choosing offspring that looked a particular way and then breeding them .PERIOD <BREAK>
The scientists that made this cute little creature ended up slaughtering it and eating it afterwards .PERIOD <BREAK>
A cama is a camel-llama hybrid ,COMMA created to try to get the hardiness of a camel with some of the personality traits of a llama .PERIOD <BREAK>
They did it with puppies .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so some states have decided to allow them ,COMMA some states have decided to ban them .PERIOD <BREAK>
And before you get too worried about it ,COMMA here in the United States ,COMMA the majority of food you buy in the supermarket already has genetically-modified components to it .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is Prometea ,COMMA the first cloned horse .PERIOD <BREAK>
These were the first cloned calves ,COMMA the first cloned grey wolves ,COMMA and then ,COMMA finally ,COMMA the first cloned piglets :COLON Alexis ,COMMA Chista ,COMMA Carrel ,COMMA Janie and Dotcom .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is the use of animals now to create drugs and other things in their bodies that we want to create .PERIOD <BREAK>
These are two creatures that were created in order to save endangered species .PERIOD <BREAK>
And now ,COMMA using a joystick ,COMMA they can send this creature around the lab and control whether it goes left or right ,COMMA forwards or backwards .PERIOD <BREAK>
We've taken away the autonomy of this animal .PERIOD <BREAK>
And he used that as the IT piece of a mechanism which ran a flight simulator .PERIOD <BREAK>
I don't know ,COMMA but in fact it is a fully living brain that we have managed to keep alive to do our bidding .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is a mouse created by Charles Vacanti of the University of Massachusetts .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is what Frankenstein's lab looks like .PERIOD <BREAK>
We are not only already using these things in animals ,COMMA some of them we're already beginning to use on our own bodies .PERIOD <BREAK>
He was raised by very supportive and interested parents .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the observations that he made on that epic journey were to be eventually distilled into his wonderful book ,COMMA On the Origin of Species ,COMMA published 150 years ago .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now what is so interesting and to some ,COMMA the extent ,COMMA what's a bit infamous about The Origin of Species ,COMMA is that there is only one line in it about human evolution .PERIOD <BREAK>
If only Darwin had NASA .PERIOD <BREAK>
This has tremendous implications for our understanding of the evolution of human skin pigmentation .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that skin pigmentation itself was a product of evolution .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA living at the equator ,COMMA we got lots and lots of ultraviolet radiation and the melanin -- this wonderful ,COMMA complex ,COMMA ancient polymer compound in our skin -- served as a superb natural sunscreen .PERIOD <BREAK>
Major moves ,COMMA outside of our equatorial homeland ,COMMA from Africa into other parts of the Old World ,COMMA and most recently ,COMMA into the New World .PERIOD <BREAK>
But it's all UVA ,COMMA and ,COMMA significantly ,COMMA that UVA has no ability to make vitamin D in your skin .PERIOD <BREAK>
Humans have been on the move for a long time .PERIOD <BREAK>
Here are just some of the biggest movements of people ,COMMA voluntary movements ,COMMA in the last 5000 years .PERIOD <BREAK>
And not all these moves were voluntary .PERIOD <BREAK>
Evolution helps us .PERIOD <BREAK>
But we need to think about how he compares ,COMMA in terms of his pigmentation ,COMMA to other people on Earth .PERIOD <BREAK>
They also run the risk of vitamin D deficiency ,COMMA if they have desk jobs ,COMMA like that guy .PERIOD <BREAK>
Darwin ,COMMA I think ,COMMA would have appreciated this ,COMMA even though he eschewed the importance of climate on the evolution of pigmentation during his own life .PERIOD <BREAK>
Well ,COMMA the topic I'm going to discuss is one which is ,COMMA in a certain sense ,COMMA very peculiar because it's very old .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now why do I show a cauliflower ,COMMA a very ordinary and ancient vegetable ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
If you try to weigh it -- of course it's very easy to weigh it ,COMMA and when you eat it ,COMMA the weight matters -- but suppose you try to measure its surface .PERIOD <BREAK>
If you cut ,COMMA with a sharp knife ,COMMA one of the florets of a cauliflower and look at it separately ,COMMA you think of a whole cauliflower ,COMMA but smaller .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA what did humanity do with that ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Well ,COMMA surprisingly enough ,COMMA it's good in many ways .PERIOD <BREAK>
It used to be very time-consuming ,COMMA but now it's nothing .PERIOD <BREAK>
Anatomists were arguing very much about that .PERIOD <BREAK>
This cloud is completely ,COMMA 100 percent artificial .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the only part which is natural is a number ,COMMA the roughness of the cloud ,COMMA which is taken from nature .PERIOD <BREAK>
Mathematicians got into self-praise to an extent which was absolutely amazing ,COMMA that man can invent things that nature did not know .PERIOD <BREAK>
In particular ,COMMA it could invent things like a curve which fills the plane .PERIOD <BREAK>
I read the book that Mr .PERIOD Eiffel wrote about his tower ,COMMA and indeed it was astonishing how much he understood .PERIOD <BREAK>
Then I was telling my assistant ,COMMA I don't see anything .PERIOD Can you paint it ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
It was very easy ,COMMA and you can write many books very fast about it .PERIOD <BREAK>
In a way ,COMMA it's the story of my life .PERIOD <BREAK>
If you could find something new ,COMMA anything ,COMMA you will get your career made .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's so complicated .PERIOD <BREAK>
Obviously ,COMMA from extraterrestrials .PERIOD <BREAK>
Thank you very much .PERIOD <BREAK>
In 1984 ,COMMA in what can only be considered one of the greatest crimes of humanity ,COMMA nearly one million people died of starvation in my country of birth ,COMMA Ethiopia .PERIOD <BREAK>
Not because there was not enough food -- because there was actually a surplus of food in the fertile regions of the south parts of the country -- but because in the north ,COMMA people could not access or entitle themselves to that food .PERIOD <BREAK>
Most Africans today ,COMMA by far ,COMMA are farmers .PERIOD <BREAK>
It also has very high cost implications .PERIOD <BREAK>
Speaking of risk ,COMMA we have seen that price volatility of food crops in Africa is the highest in the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
In the American Midwest ,COMMA farmers used to load grain onto barges and send it upriver to the Chicago market .PERIOD <BREAK>
What's really important is that the ECX will operate a market information system to disseminate prices in real time to farmers around the country ,COMMA using VSAT technology to bring an electronic price dissemination directly to farmers .PERIOD <BREAK>
And they come to the market knowing what grades their products will achieve in terms of a price premium .PERIOD <BREAK>
We believe that the winds of change are here ,COMMA and that we can do it .PERIOD <BREAK>
We believe that the stakes are high ,COMMA but that the returns will be even greater .PERIOD <BREAK>
Ethiopia's agricultural market is 30 percent higher than South Africa's grain production ,COMMA and ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA Ethiopia is the second largest maize producer in Africa .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's a bit funny to be at a conference dedicated to things not seen ,COMMA and present my proposal to build a 6000 -kilometer-long wall across the entire African continent .PERIOD <BREAK>
The threat is desertification .PERIOD <BREAK>
It is always the same ,COMMA never the same ,COMMA endlessly fascinating .PERIOD <BREAK>
One billion grains of sand come into existence in the world each second .PERIOD <BREAK>
Just south of the Sahara we find the Sahel .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now there is an alternative to just planting trees and hoping that they won't get chopped down .PERIOD <BREAK>
Inside of the dunes we find shade .PERIOD <BREAK>
Here I am ,COMMA playing the part of the mad scientist ,COMMA working with the bugs at UCL in London ,COMMA trying to solidify them .PERIOD <BREAK>
Well ,COMMA I was inspired ,COMMA for my architectural form ,COMMA by tafoni ,COMMA which look a little bit like this ,COMMA this is a model representation of it .PERIOD <BREAK>
These are cavernous rock structures that I found on the site in Sokoto .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's not true at all .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA there it is -- architectural anti-desertification structures made from the desert itself .PERIOD <BREAK>
My design ,COMMA as it takes you down the rabbit hole ,COMMA is fraught with many challenges and difficulties in the real world .PERIOD <BREAK>
Our goal is a repository of published designs so clear ,COMMA so complete ,COMMA that a single burned DVD is effectively a civilization starter kit .PERIOD <BREAK>
He was talking about the space aliens .PERIOD <BREAK>
I have never built an atomic pile .PERIOD <BREAK>
Think about it .PERIOD <BREAK>
I was pretty good at the video games .PERIOD I was not very good at the other part ,COMMA so I stayed alone with the cosmos .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA you could describe this as a simple misunderstanding -- a strange encounter among humans .PERIOD <BREAK>
I went with my friend Tim McGonigal ,COMMA who sat on my left .PERIOD <BREAK>
I remember ,COMMA she had some sort of injury to her ankle ,COMMA an Ace bandage ,COMMA and she had crutches .PERIOD <BREAK>
I was starting high school at the time .PERIOD I would say she was a junior ,COMMA but I had never seen her before .PERIOD She didn't go to my school .PERIOD <BREAK>
I mean ,COMMA I liked him a lot better than the sandworms .PERIOD <BREAK>
Except for the girl .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the way I remember it ,COMMA the movie featured these details .PERIOD <BREAK>
But I was exhausted and dog-bitten ,COMMA and so I said ,COMMA No .PERIOD <BREAK>
I realized that the day would only have two possible outcomes :COLON either Catherine would come back to the hotel ,COMMA or she would never come back to the hotel .PERIOD <BREAK>
But he did not seem so very sure ,COMMA for he sat down to wait with me .PERIOD <BREAK>
I mean ,COMMA somebody pays you to go around and travel and look at some of the most beautiful places on the planet .PERIOD <BREAK>
We know that hurricanes have always happened in the past .PERIOD <BREAK>
We hear a lot about the collapse of cod .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's a little hard to understand that ,COMMA because you can go to a Costco in the United States and buy cheap fish .PERIOD <BREAK>
The trophy fish were so big that you couldn't put any of those small fish up on it .PERIOD <BREAK>
And people paid less in 1950 dollars to catch that than what people pay now to catch those little ,COMMA tiny fish .PERIOD <BREAK>
You can see the rows in the bottom ,COMMA the way you can see the rows in a field that has just been plowed to plant corn .PERIOD <BREAK>
It was when I was on holiday last early autumn in France .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is from the coast of Brittany ,COMMA which is being enveloped in this green ,COMMA algal slime .PERIOD <BREAK>
The governments of the world are taking this really seriously .PERIOD <BREAK>
The consequence of that is that all those nutrients that fuel the great anchoveta fisheries ,COMMA of the sardines of California or in Peru or whatever ,COMMA those slow down and those fisheries collapse .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now I haven't got anything against efficiency .PERIOD <BREAK>
In the world I describe to you ,COMMA we have to be right over here at the right-hand side at six grams of carbon .PERIOD <BREAK>
So I want to just spend a couple of minutes on system dynamics .PERIOD <BREAK>
So it looks a little bit like this .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's called the circular flow of the economy .PERIOD <BREAK>
They want to hunker down ,COMMA they want to look to the future .PERIOD <BREAK>
Are we these novelty-seeking ,COMMA hedonistic ,COMMA selfish individuals ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
It is about allowing ourselves the freedom to become fully human ,COMMA recognizing the depth and the breadth of the human psyche and building institutions to protect Rembrandt's fragile altruist within .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we're going to do it .PERIOD <BREAK>
We're just going to click on Naturejobsuk .PERIOD <BREAK>
And this too requires investment ,COMMA investment -- for example ,COMMA in places -- places where we can connect ,COMMA places where we can participate ,COMMA shared spaces ,COMMA concert halls ,COMMA gardens ,COMMA public parks ,COMMA libraries ,COMMA museums ,COMMA quiet centers ,COMMA places of joy and celebration ,COMMA places of tranquility and contemplation ,COMMA sites for the cultivation of a common citizenship ,COMMA in Michael Sandel's lovely phrase .PERIOD <BREAK>
Chris Anderson :COLON While they're taking the podium away ,COMMA just a quick question .PERIOD <BREAK>
You're making news out of the things that tell you that we're flourishing .PERIOD <BREAK>
But it has to have political leadership .PERIOD <BREAK>
The napalm is burning there quite nicely .PERIOD <BREAK>
Oil doesn't sink ,COMMA it floats .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the other thing it does is it spreads out the moment it hits the water .PERIOD <BREAK>
It triples the amount of oily ,COMMA messy goo that you have in the water ,COMMA and it makes it very hard to handle .PERIOD <BREAK>
When the chemistry of the oil and water also hits our politics ,COMMA it's absolutely explosive .PERIOD <BREAK>
They have a eureka !EXCLAMATIONMARK moment ,COMMA when we suddenly understand oil in a different context .PERIOD <BREAK>
You might notice that many gas pumps ,COMMA including this one ,COMMA are designed to look like ATMs .PERIOD <BREAK>
Early journalists looked at these spills ,COMMA and they said ,COMMA This is a filthy industry .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the thing about John D .PERIOD is that he went into this chaotic wild-east of oil industry ,COMMA and he rationalized it into a vertically integrated company ,COMMA a multinational .PERIOD <BREAK>
And then there's this guy ,COMMA okay .PERIOD <BREAK>
So the thing about water oil spills is that they are very politically galvanizing .PERIOD <BREAK>
They really influence people .PERIOD <BREAK>
Everything that we are really stemmed from this period .PERIOD <BREAK>
One of the things that happened with the two previous oil spills was that we really worked on some of the symptoms .PERIOD <BREAK>
And these guys ,COMMA I mean ,COMMA if they were in the US ,COMMA they might be actually here in this room .PERIOD <BREAK>
And then the guy in the Exxon uniform stepped out ,COMMA and we realized it was okay .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA what I'm going to talk to you about now is :COLON what do we have to do this time ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
We need to kind of get down and do the gritty work of reducing our dependence upon this fuel and these molecules .PERIOD <BREAK>
Cynthia Schneider :COLON These programs are reaching incredibly deeply into society .PERIOD <BREAK>
People become so engaged that they have volunteers ,COMMA just like political volunteers anyway ,COMMA who fan out over the countryside ,COMMA campaigning for their candidate .PERIOD <BREAK>
One of them ,COMMA Lima Sahar ,COMMA is a Pashtun from Kandahar ,COMMA a very conservative part of the country .PERIOD <BREAK>
It turns out that competition and winning is a universal human value .PERIOD <BREAK>
And then a thought came across my mind :COLON if things go pear-shaped on this swim ,COMMA how long will it take for my frozen body to sink the four and a half kilometers to the bottom of the ocean ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Nearly two billion people -- so one in three people on this earth -- rely on the water from the Himalayas .PERIOD <BREAK>
I carried on for another five or six strokes ,COMMA and then I had nothing in my body ,COMMA and I went down to the bottom of the lake .PERIOD <BREAK>
It is the most frightening and panicky feeling that you can have .PERIOD <BREAK>
And there ,COMMA we sat down ,COMMA and we did a debrief about what had gone wrong there on Mt .PERIOD Everest .PERIOD <BREAK>
Take some time to rest and think about things .PERIOD <BREAK>
I say ,COMMA I do hardware ,COMMA because it sort of conveniently encompasses everything I do .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA this talk is going to be about how do we make things and what are the new ways that we're going to make things in the future .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I was laughing about this with the very smart colleagues I have ,COMMA and said ,COMMA You know ,COMMA well ,COMMA if I have to talk about the future ,COMMA what is it ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Literally ,COMMA think of proteins as subroutines that you can string together to execute a program .PERIOD <BREAK>
And this is being built by a group of students at Zurich for a design competition in biology .PERIOD <BREAK>
Took me six years at MIT ,COMMA and about that many pages to describe what I was doing ,COMMA and it took him one page .PERIOD And so this is our muse Tucker .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the ribosome here is another little computer that helps in the translation of the proteins .PERIOD <BREAK>
These are little mechanical computers .PERIOD <BREAK>
These are five-state state machines .PERIOD <BREAK>
In a neutral state ,COMMA they won't bind at all .PERIOD <BREAK>
So now I'm going to show you the hands-free ,COMMA autonomous self-replication .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA Neil Gershenfeld showed you this video on Wednesday ,COMMA I believe ,COMMA but I'll show you again .PERIOD <BREAK>
And how do we think about materials and structure ,COMMA sort of as an information and computation problem ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
This is a machine where you literally define a boundary condition .PERIOD <BREAK>
We will be an overwhelmingly urban species .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the correlation ,COMMA of course ,COMMA is that denser places tend to have lower emissions -- which isn't really all that difficult to figure out ,COMMA if you think about it .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we're basically using mobility to get the access we need .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it is possible ,COMMA of course ,COMMA to increase the density of the communities around us .PERIOD <BREAK>
Do they even take the very waste matter that we have from food and fiber and so forth ,COMMA and turn it back into soil and sequester carbon -- take carbon out of the air in the process of using our cities ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Because right now ,COMMA our economy by and large operates as Paul Hawken said ,COMMA by stealing the future ,COMMA selling it in the present and calling it GDP .PERIOD <BREAK>
President Clinton ,COMMA if you're here ,COMMA thank you .PERIOD <BREAK>
Well ,COMMA why has violence declined ?QUESTIONMARK No one really knows ,COMMA but I have read four explanations ,COMMA all of which ,COMMA I think ,COMMA have some grain of plausibility .PERIOD The first is ,COMMA maybe Thomas Hobbes got it right .PERIOD He was the one who said that life in a state of nature was solitary ,COMMA poor ,COMMA nasty ,COMMA brutish and short .PERIOD Not because ,COMMA he argued ,COMMA humans have some primordial thirst for blood or aggressive instinct or territorial imperative ,COMMA but because of the logic of anarchy .PERIOD In a state of anarchy ,COMMA there's a constant temptation to invade your neighbors preemptively ,COMMA before they invade you .PERIOD More recently ,COMMA Thomas Schelling gives the analogy of a homeowner who hears a rustling in the basement .PERIOD Being a good American ,COMMA he has a pistol in the nightstand ,COMMA pulls out his gun ,COMMA and walks down the stairs .PERIOD <BREAK>
It removes the need for a hair trigger for retaliation to make your deterrent threat credible .PERIOD And therefore ,COMMA it would lead to a state of peace .PERIOD Eisner -- the man who plotted the homicide rates that you failed to see in the earlier slide -- argued that the timing of the decline of homicide in Europe coincided with the rise of centralized states .PERIOD <BREAK>
This was an argument from the political scientist James Payne .PERIOD <BREAK>
Because we have been doing something right ,COMMA and it sure would be good to find out what it is .PERIOD <BREAK>
We learned it in college .PERIOD <BREAK>
We have Liberia .PERIOD We have Congo .PERIOD <BREAK>
Income per person .PERIOD I can put that here .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's why we are so scared about flu ,COMMA isn't it ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And especially ,COMMA it's interesting to see China and the United States during 200 years ,COMMA because I have my oldest son now working for Google ,COMMA after Google acquired this software .PERIOD <BREAK>
Mao Tse-Tung eventually brought health to China ,COMMA and then he died ,COMMA and then Deng Xiaoping started this amazing move forward .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I come now ,COMMA into projections ,COMMA but I have to stop at the door of Lehman Brothers there ,COMMA you know ,COMMA because -- that's where the projections are not valid any longer .PERIOD <BREAK>
East Europe ,COMMA Latin America ,COMMA and OECD countries .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's Lincoln here ,COMMA advancing them .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we have countries all this way .PERIOD <BREAK>
And what has happened in the world ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
We used to boast about fast social progress .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's where we were ,COMMA 1900 .PERIOD <BREAK>
And you can see it's not that easy ,COMMA that it is war which caused this .PERIOD <BREAK>
And here ,COMMA in Zambia ,COMMA there is peace .PERIOD <BREAK>
If I split Tanzania in its income ,COMMA the richer 20 percent in Tanzania has more HIV than the poorest one .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it's really different within each country .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's similar to the pellagra epidemic in Mississippi in the ' 30 s .PERIOD <BREAK>
We have seen it here in Mozambique .PERIOD <BREAK>
That used to be the illegal diamond trade ,COMMA from the UNITA-dominated area in Angola .PERIOD <BREAK>
Don't get confused of the progress of the emerging economies and the great capacity of people in the middle income countries and in peaceful low income countries .PERIOD <BREAK>
I am a reformed marketer ,COMMA and I now work in international development .PERIOD <BREAK>
He said there's just not in demand .PERIOD <BREAK>
And as a marketer ,COMMA I found that curious .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it turns out that there are three main messages used by the donor agencies for these condoms :COLON fear ,COMMA financing and fidelity .PERIOD <BREAK>
They package it with the red ribbon that reminds us of HIV ,COMMA put it in boxes that remind you who paid for them ,COMMA show pictures of your wife or husband and tell you to protect them or to act prudently .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so the lesson is this :COLON it doesn't really matter what you're selling ;SEMICOLON you just have to think about who is your customer ,COMMA and what are the messages that are going to get them to change their behavior .PERIOD <BREAK>
It was before the avian flu had reached Europe .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'll see what I can do .PERIOD OK ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Generations go by ,COMMA somebody says ,COMMA hey ,COMMA why don't we put it on a stick ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Just absolutely delights the little ones .PERIOD <BREAK>
Point is :COLON there's obviously collaboration and organization going on beyond national bounds .PERIOD <BREAK>
A lot of forms of non-zero-sum behavior in the realm of economics and so on in everyday life often leads to cooperation .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA this sounds like an intrinsically upbeat worldview in a way ,COMMA because when you think of non-zero ,COMMA you think win-win ,COMMA you know ,COMMA that's good .PERIOD Well ,COMMA there are a few reasons that actually it's not intrinsically upbeat .PERIOD <BREAK>
I have a whole global governance sermon that I will spare you right now ,COMMA because I don't think that's going to be enough anyway ,COMMA although it's essential .PERIOD <BREAK>
That is to say -- -- thank you ,COMMA thank you .PERIOD That is to say ,COMMA remember :COLON my whole view of morality is that it boils down to self-interest .PERIOD <BREAK>
Doing the best I can ,COMMA OK .PERIOD <BREAK>
It was kind of along these lines ,COMMA and the allegation was that I have ,COMMA quote ,COMMA affection for terrorists .PERIOD <BREAK>
And a kind of saving higher moral level ,COMMA something that kind of literally saves the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
Yahweh is our Savior means He has saved the nation of Israel ,COMMA which at the time ,COMMA was a pretty high-level social organization .PERIOD <BREAK>
I am very ,COMMA very happy to be amidst some of the most -- the lights are really disturbing my eyes and they're reflecting on my glasses .PERIOD <BREAK>
Because despair ,COMMA civil war ,COMMA hunger and famine ,COMMA although they're part and parcel of our African reality ,COMMA they are not the only reality .PERIOD <BREAK>
But they also succeed at the job of entrepreneurship .PERIOD <BREAK>
Support private investment in Africa ,COMMA both domestic and foreign .PERIOD <BREAK>
Which country is that ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
The productive margin in our governments' search for revenue does not lie in the domestic economy ,COMMA it lies with international donors .PERIOD <BREAK>
The IMF ,COMMA the World Bank ,COMMA and the cartel of good intentions in the world has taken over our rights as citizens ,COMMA and therefore what our governments are doing ,COMMA because they depend on aid ,COMMA is to listen to international creditors rather than their own citizens .PERIOD <BREAK>
They talk to international donors .PERIOD <BREAK>
Where has all the aid gone ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Uganda's recurrent expenditure -- by recurrent what do I mean ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
The editor of Discover told us 10 of them ,COMMA I'm going to give you the eleventh .PERIOD <BREAK>
So they came to me -- CNN -- and they said ,COMMA Professor Seligman ,COMMA would you tell us about the state of psychology today ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Look ,COMMA Doctor Seligman ,COMMA we can see you're really not comfortable in this medium .PERIOD <BREAK>
Not good enough .PERIOD And that's what I'm going to be talking about .PERIOD <BREAK>
It should be just as concerned with building strength as with repairing damage .PERIOD <BREAK>
And starting about six years ago ,COMMA we asked about extremely happy people .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's what Aristotle was talking about .PERIOD <BREAK>
The first life is the pleasant life and it's simply ,COMMA as best we can find it ,COMMA it's having as many of the pleasures as you can ,COMMA as much positive emotion as you can ,COMMA and learning the skills -- savoring ,COMMA mindfulness -- that amplify them ,COMMA that stretch them over time and space .PERIOD <BREAK>
In two of the three great arenas of life ,COMMA by the time Len was 30 ,COMMA Len was enormously successful .PERIOD The first arena was work .PERIOD <BREAK>
It turned out that -- Len grew up in Long Island and he played football and watched football ,COMMA and played bridge -- Len is in the bottom five percent of what we call positive affectivities .PERIOD <BREAK>
When he walks onto the floor of the American Exchange at 930 in the morning ,COMMA time stops for him .PERIOD And it stops till the closing bell .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we think there's a recipe for it ,COMMA and it's knowing what your highest strengths are .PERIOD <BREAK>
Just one example .PERIOD One person I worked with was a bagger at Genuardi's .PERIOD <BREAK>
Her highest strength was social intelligence ,COMMA so she re-crafted bagging to make the encounter with her the social highlight of every customer's day .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now obviously she failed .PERIOD <BREAK>
What you get out of that is not smiley-ness .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'd like you to remember someone who did something enormously important that changed your life in a good direction ,COMMA and who you never properly thanked .PERIOD <BREAK>
I hope all of you have such a person .PERIOD <BREAK>
But they were empty .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so ,COMMA the parallel thing holds with technology ,COMMA entertainment and design ,COMMA I believe .PERIOD <BREAK>
So in conclusion ,COMMA the eleventh reason for optimism ,COMMA in addition to the space elevator ,COMMA is that I think with technology ,COMMA entertainment and design ,COMMA we can actually increase the amount of tonnage of human happiness on the planet .PERIOD <BREAK>
And if technology can ,COMMA in the next decade or two ,COMMA increase the pleasant life ,COMMA the good life and the meaningful life ,COMMA it will be good enough .PERIOD <BREAK>
Here's an example .PERIOD <BREAK>
Four years ago ,COMMA I was at the beach with my son ,COMMA and he was learning how to swim in this relatively soft surf of the Delaware beaches .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA this represents -- this is a cross-sample of some remarkable images taken by some of the world's greatest photojournalists ,COMMA working at the very top of their craft -- except one .PERIOD <BREAK>
But to be a great photojournalist ,COMMA you have to have more than just one or two great photographs in you .PERIOD <BREAK>
But the centerpiece species of Zakouma are the elephants .PERIOD <BREAK>
And instead ,COMMA created a story that touched our audiences deeply .PERIOD <BREAK>
Instead of just knowledge of this park ,COMMA he created an understanding and an empathy for the elephants ,COMMA the rangers and the many issues surrounding human-wildlife conflicts .PERIOD <BREAK>
He saw that this was a living and breathing and vital part of how the entire urban area functioned .PERIOD <BREAK>
We also want to look for solutions .PERIOD <BREAK>
Jim took what could have been a straight-up medical science story and gave it a human dimension that touched our readers deeply .PERIOD <BREAK>
But there are also times when photographers simply encounter things that are ,COMMA when it comes down to it ,COMMA just plain fun .PERIOD <BREAK>
Thank you .PERIOD <BREAK>
And my father was a soldier ,COMMA and my uncle was a fisherman and also a poacher .PERIOD <BREAK>
For three times ,COMMA I applied to biomedical science ,COMMA to be a doctor .PERIOD <BREAK>
With the end of the dictatorship regime of Mobutu Sese Seko ,COMMA that most of you know ,COMMA life became very ,COMMA very difficult .PERIOD <BREAK>
So they started fleeing from the east to the west .PERIOD <BREAK>
All my friends said ,COMMA we are leaving because we are a target .PERIOD <BREAK>
But I'm not going to the east ,COMMA because I don't know Swahili .PERIOD <BREAK>
Because he's Pygmy ,COMMA he knows how to track elephants in the forest .PERIOD <BREAK>
They came to told me ,COMMA I have to save him .PERIOD <BREAK>
Everywhere there has been constant extraction of mineral ,COMMA killing animals ,COMMA the logging timbers and so on .PERIOD <BREAK>
That is Coltan extraction ,COMMA gold mining .PERIOD <BREAK>
We have to do it ,COMMA because to let our movement advance .PERIOD <BREAK>
After a week ,COMMA we celebrated the birthday of that Okapi ,COMMA they killed an elephant ,COMMA just 50 meters to the area where the zoo ,COMMA where Okapi was born .PERIOD <BREAK>
I devoted half of it to rebuild the herbarium ,COMMA because we didn't have good infrastructure to start plants .PERIOD <BREAK>
But is gun industries a tool to rebuild ,COMMA or is it a game ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And they can't go even to university .PERIOD <BREAK>
Thank you ,COMMA thank you .PERIOD <BREAK>
One of the biggest challenges in computer graphics has been being able to create a photo-real ,COMMA digital human face .PERIOD <BREAK>
And one of the reasons it is so difficult is that ,COMMA unlike aliens and dinosaurs ,COMMA we look at human faces every day .PERIOD <BREAK>
We shoot all of these photographs in about three seconds .PERIOD <BREAK>
If we zoom in on this photograph right here ,COMMA we can see it's a really nice photograph to have of her ,COMMA because she is lit from absolutely everywhere at the same time to get a nice image of her facial texture .PERIOD <BREAK>
We're just seeing the coarse-scale geometry here .PERIOD <BREAK>
And thank you very much .PERIOD <BREAK>
We're roughly two days from the entrance at that point .PERIOD <BREAK>
Otherwise it is completely dark in these places .PERIOD <BREAK>
Next year I'll be leading an international team to J 2 .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is one of the places where planetary scientists believe there is a highest probability of the detection of the first life off earth in the ocean that exists below there .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's basically a nuclear-heated torpedo .PERIOD <BREAK>
One is ,COMMA how do you do science autonomy underground ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
How do you take a robot and turn it into a field microbiologist ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
If it passes the microscopic test ,COMMA we go for a collection .PERIOD <BREAK>
No hands at the wheel .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is all behavioral autonomy here that's being conducted by the robot on its own .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's more than you pay for TED ,COMMA if Google dropped their sponsorship .PERIOD <BREAK>
There is a place where you can .PERIOD <BREAK>
If we're going to get that ,COMMA and make that gas station possible ,COMMA we have to figure out ways to move large volumes of payload through space .PERIOD <BREAK>
It has never been done .PERIOD <BREAK>
I like this equipment ,COMMA you know ,COMMA and I really value it so we're not going to burn the gear .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I'm gonna try and do that within the 18 -minute time span that we were told to stay within ,COMMA and to follow the TED commandments :COLON that is ,COMMA actually ,COMMA something that creates a near-death experience ,COMMA but near-death is good for creativity .PERIOD <BREAK>
I think that part of it also begins with a sense of identity crisis :COLON you know ,COMMA who am I ,COMMA why am I this particular person ,COMMA why am I not black like everybody else ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
I used to draw .PERIOD I thought I would be an artist .PERIOD <BREAK>
And when you are faced with the prospect of death very soon ,COMMA you begin to think very much about everything .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA in quantum mechanics ,COMMA of course ,COMMA you have dark energy and dark matter .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that's what I look for in my work ,COMMA a personal meaning .PERIOD <BREAK>
And they also have to make a living ,COMMA and people need to be fed .PERIOD <BREAK>
It may be something that is perhaps more serious -- as I said ,COMMA human rights in Burma .PERIOD <BREAK>
This leads to this question .PERIOD <BREAK>
In this case ,COMMA I was writing a story that included some kind of detail ,COMMA period of history ,COMMA a certain location .PERIOD <BREAK>
Especially when good things happen ,COMMA and ,COMMA in particular ,COMMA when bad things happen .PERIOD <BREAK>
But I do think there's a kind of serendipity ,COMMA and I do want to know what those elements are ,COMMA so I can thank them ,COMMA and also try to find them in my life .PERIOD <BREAK>
Is it because I had the filter that I have such a strong coincidence in writing about these things ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
It takes a while ,COMMA but I have to let go of them and just go there ,COMMA and be there .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the reason is that until Wonder came along and figured out how to spread the idea of sliced bread ,COMMA no one wanted it .PERIOD <BREAK>
And when I talk about it I usually pick business because they make the best pictures that you can put in your presentation ,COMMA and because it's the easiest sort of way to keep score .PERIOD <BREAK>
Well ,COMMA this TV-industrial complex informed my entire childhood and probably yours .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I ignored every message because I don't have a pain reliever problem .PERIOD <BREAK>
I buy the stuff in the yellow box because I always have .PERIOD <BREAK>
Consumers don't care about you at all ;SEMICOLON they just don't care .PERIOD <BREAK>
Because people saw it and said -- I didn't know that was there -- and they noticed it .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the thing is ,COMMA people in the fashion business know what it's like to be in the fashion business -- they're used to it .PERIOD <BREAK>
The rest of us have to figure out how to think that way .PERIOD <BREAK>
How to understand that it's not about interrupting people with big full-page ads ,COMMA or insisting on meetings with people .PERIOD <BREAK>
He lived in Paris .PERIOD Last year he sold 10 million dollars' worth of French bread .PERIOD <BREAK>
It was neat ;SEMICOLON it was remarkable ;SEMICOLON and slowly it spread from one person to another person until finally ,COMMA it became the official bread of three-star restaurants in Paris .PERIOD <BREAK>
They would ignore the geeks ,COMMA and God forbid ,COMMA the laggards .PERIOD <BREAK>
To make a product ,COMMA to market an idea ,COMMA to come up with any problem you want to solve that doesn't have a constituency with an otaku ,COMMA is almost impossible .PERIOD <BREAK>
Krispy Kreme has a strategy ,COMMA and what they do is ,COMMA they enter a city ,COMMA they talk to the people with otaku ,COMMA and then they spread through the city to the people who've just crossed the street .PERIOD <BREAK>
They're made from cremains .PERIOD <BREAK>
Oh ,COMMA you like my ring ?QUESTIONMARK It's my grandmother .PERIOD <BREAK>
Fastest-growing business in the whole mortuary industry .PERIOD <BREAK>
The first one is :COLON Design is free when you get to scale .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the people who come up with stuff that's remarkable more often than not figure out how to put design to work for them .PERIOD <BREAK>
Silk .PERIOD Put a product that does not need to be in the refrigerated section next to the milk in the refrigerated section .PERIOD <BREAK>
For the people who were there and looking at that section ,COMMA it was remarkable .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I wanted to tell stories about all the amazing things I was seeing underwater ,COMMA incredible wildlife and interesting behaviors .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the ice that is there is quite thin .PERIOD <BREAK>
These are the tuna ,COMMA the billfish and the sharks .PERIOD <BREAK>
But the truth is we're way too efficient at catching them ,COMMA and their stocks have collapsed worldwide .PERIOD <BREAK>
So this is the true cost of a shrimp dinner ,COMMA maybe seven or eight shrimp and 10 pounds of other animals that had to die in the process .PERIOD <BREAK>
I also wanted to focus on the shark fishing industry because ,COMMA currently on planet Earth ,COMMA we're killing over 100 million sharks every single year .PERIOD <BREAK>
But before I went out to photograph this component ,COMMA I sort of wrestled with the notion of how do you make a picture of a dead shark that will resonate with readers You know ,COMMA I think there's still a lot of people out there who think the only good shark is a dead shark .PERIOD <BREAK>
One of the locations was this place called Tiger Beach ,COMMA in the northern Bahamas where tiger sharks aggregate in shallow water .PERIOD <BREAK>
I also searched on this story for the elusive great hammerhead ,COMMA an animal that really hadn't been photographed much until maybe about seven or 10 years ago .PERIOD <BREAK>
But this is crucial habitat and it's where they spend the first two ,COMMA three years of their lives ,COMMA until they're big enough to go out on the rest of the reef .PERIOD <BREAK>
I actually jumped in and photographed this ,COMMA and with the fisherman's permission ,COMMA I cut the turtle out ,COMMA and it was able to swim free .PERIOD <BREAK>
But ,COMMA you know ,COMMA thousands of other leatherbacks each year are not so fortunate ,COMMA and the species' future is in great danger .PERIOD <BREAK>
You can see the coal burning plant in the background .PERIOD <BREAK>
I went down there in the winter time .PERIOD <BREAK>
And these are animals that had never seen humans before ,COMMA and I was one of the first people they probably had ever seen .PERIOD <BREAK>
For example ,COMMA they hoped that certain species of fish like the New Zealand snapper would return because they had been fished to the brink of commercial extinction .PERIOD <BREAK>
But when the fish came back and began predating and controlling the urchin population ,COMMA low and behold ,COMMA kelp forests emerged in shallow water .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that's because the urchins eat kelp .PERIOD <BREAK>
Little blue cod swimming in for a dash of color .PERIOD <BREAK>
The ocean is ,COMMA indeed ,COMMA resilient and tolerant to a point ,COMMA but we must be good custodians .PERIOD <BREAK>
But I'm moving past Malthus ,COMMA because I think that we just might be about 150 years from a kind of new enlightenment .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the world's population expected to top out at something hopefully a bit less than 10 billion ,COMMA late this century .PERIOD <BREAK>
But look what happened in Europe after the plague :COLON rising wages ,COMMA land reform ,COMMA technological innovation ,COMMA birth of the middle class ;SEMICOLON and after that ,COMMA forward-looking social movements like the Renaissance ,COMMA and later the Enlightenment .PERIOD <BREAK>
Because transitions are dangerous times .PERIOD <BREAK>
Fear for the future leads to some rash decisions .PERIOD <BREAK>
I was walking in the market one day with my wife ,COMMA and somebody stuck a cage in my face .PERIOD <BREAK>
So we're in East Borneo .PERIOD This is the place where I started .PERIOD <BREAK>
What we did was we formulated recipes -- how to go from a starting situation where you have nothing to a target situation .PERIOD <BREAK>
And once the soil gets dried ,COMMA you're in a dry season -- you get cracks ,COMMA oxygen goes in ,COMMA flames come out and the problem starts all over again .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is what it looked like for three months .PERIOD <BREAK>
We lost all the crops .PERIOD No children gained weight for over a year ;SEMICOLON they lost 12 IQ points .PERIOD It was a disaster for orangutans and people .PERIOD <BREAK>
That was why I put it as a single point up there .PERIOD <BREAK>
You need the bacteria to fix nitrogen ,COMMA and without those microorganisms ,COMMA you won't have any performance at all .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we have monitored every single one of those trees from space .PERIOD <BREAK>
In the beginning ,COMMA maybe pineapples and beans and corn ;SEMICOLON in the second phase ,COMMA there will be bananas and papayas ;SEMICOLON later on ,COMMA there will be chocolate and chilies .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that's green .PERIOD If you look from the tower -- this is when we start attacking the grass .PERIOD <BREAK>
Air humidity is up 10 percent .PERIOD <BREAK>
Each of the families that have sold their land now get a piece of land back .PERIOD <BREAK>
If one member trespasses the agreement ,COMMA and does cut down trees ,COMMA the other 19 members have to decide what's going to happen to him .PERIOD <BREAK>
In North Sulawesi it is the cooperative -- they have a democratic culture there ,COMMA so there you can use the local justice system to protect your system .PERIOD <BREAK>
They can now sell part of those fruits to the orangutan project .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now I think the real key to doing it ,COMMA to give a simple answer ,COMMA is integration .PERIOD <BREAK>
There's no matter of scale .PERIOD It's not a question of scale ,COMMA it's not a question of financial resources .PERIOD <BREAK>
And most of the people are leaving the city and living outside of the city .PERIOD <BREAK>
He is invited for a party -- he never wants to leave .PERIOD <BREAK>
He's a very demanding person .PERIOD <BREAK>
Parks -- old quarries that they were transformed into parks .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA in a city ,COMMA you have to work fast .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we cannot have all the answers .PERIOD <BREAK>
You see ,COMMA he's right .PERIOD <BREAK>
He said ,COMMA There are two types of people in this world :COLON those who divide the world into two types and those who do not .PERIOD <BREAK>
If you said to them ,COMMA Don't do this anymore ,COMMA they'd wonder what you were talking about .PERIOD <BREAK>
You have to create the circumstances where they show themselves .PERIOD <BREAK>
It means challenging what we take for granted ,COMMA things that we think are obvious .PERIOD <BREAK>
He said this in December 1862 to the second annual meeting of Congress .PERIOD <BREAK>
I ought to explain that I have no idea what was happening at the time .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA no doubt ,COMMA something fascinating was happening in December 1862 ,COMMA which the Americans among us will be aware of .PERIOD <BREAK>
You know what it means ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
But our minds are still hypnotized by them ,COMMA and we have to disenthrall ourselves of some of them .PERIOD <BREAK>
Teenagers do not wear wristwatches .PERIOD <BREAK>
She doesn't see the point .PERIOD <BREAK>
It has multiple functions .PERIOD <BREAK>
Everybody who's spoken at TED has told us implicitly ,COMMA or sometimes explicitly ,COMMA a different story :COLON that life is not linear ;SEMICOLON it's organic .PERIOD <BREAK>
I don't mean you shouldn't go to college ,COMMA but not everybody needs to go and not everybody needs to go now .PERIOD <BREAK>
You know ,COMMA to me ,COMMA human communities depend upon a diversity of talent ,COMMA not a singular conception of ability .PERIOD <BREAK>
Kids sitting in front of unimpressed panels ,COMMA you know ,COMMA with their resumes ,COMMA flipping through and saying ,COMMA Well ,COMMA this is it ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
I was very struck by Natalie Merchant's songs last night ,COMMA recovering old poems .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's axiomatic .PERIOD Why not us ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
They went on to describe me as America's greenest CEO .PERIOD <BREAK>
And theft of our children's future would someday be a crime .PERIOD <BREAK>
According to Paul and Anne Ehrlich and a well-known environmental impact equation ,COMMA impact -- a bad thing -- is the product of population ,COMMA affluence and technology .PERIOD <BREAK>
Paul and Anne Ehrlich's environmental impact equation :COLON I is equal to P times A times T :COLON population ,COMMA affluence and technology .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I reasoned that if we could make those transformative changes ,COMMA and get rid of T 1 altogether ,COMMA we could reduce our impact to zero ,COMMA including our impact on the climate .PERIOD <BREAK>
Fossil fuel usage is down 60 percent per unit of production ,COMMA due to efficiencies in renewables .PERIOD <BREAK>
Down 40 percent in our broadloom carpet business ,COMMA which we acquired in 1993 right here in California ,COMMA City of Industry ,COMMA where water is so precious .PERIOD <BREAK>
We have diverted 148 million pounds -- that's 74000 tons -- of used carpet from landfills ,COMMA closing the loop on material flows through reverse logistics and post-consumer recycling technologies that did not exist when we started 14 years ago .PERIOD <BREAK>
Costs ,COMMA products ,COMMA people ,COMMA marketplaces -- what else is there ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
But the marketplace was down 36 percent .PERIOD <BREAK>
We can see our way now ,COMMA clear to the top of that mountain .PERIOD <BREAK>
Who is that person ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And we're all acutely aware :COLON what's it going to mean in the future when we ask someone to pay a hundred dollars for a symphony ,COMMA opera or ballet ticket ,COMMA when that cultural consumer is used to downloading on the internet 24 hours a day for 99 cents a song or for free ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
The arts reformation ,COMMA like the religious Reformation ,COMMA is spurred in part by technology ,COMMA with indeed ,COMMA the printing press really leading the charge on the religious Reformation .PERIOD <BREAK>
This group ,COMMA others have called the pro ams ,COMMA amateur artists doing work at a professional level .PERIOD <BREAK>
But I want to be clear ,COMMA just as the religious Reformation did not spell the end to the formal Church or to the priesthood ;SEMICOLON I believe that our artistic institutions will continue to have importance .PERIOD <BREAK>
And indeed ,COMMA I think ,COMMA rather than being annihilated ,COMMA the performing arts are posed on the brink of a time when we will be more important than we have ever been .PERIOD <BREAK>
I salute all of you as activists in that quest and urge you to embrace and hold dear the arts in your work ,COMMA whatever your purpose may be .PERIOD <BREAK>
Thank you .PERIOD <BREAK>
Manchester Craftsmen's Guild is named after my neighborhood .PERIOD <BREAK>
Built in a tough neighborhood where people have been given up for dead .PERIOD <BREAK>
My view is that if you want to involve yourself in the life of people who have been given up on ,COMMA you have to look like the solution and not the problem .PERIOD <BREAK>
And now that I'm giving speeches at conferences like TED ,COMMA I got put on the board of the Carnegie Museum .PERIOD <BREAK>
Well ,COMMA I think that welfare mothers and at-risk kids and ex-steel workers deserve a fountain in their life .PERIOD <BREAK>
And he called me into his office -- which is the equivalent of going to see the Wizard of Oz -- and John Heinz had 600 million dollars ,COMMA and at the time I had about 60 cents .PERIOD <BREAK>
So at my school ,COMMA we subsidize a gourmet lunch program for welfare mothers in the middle of the inner city because we've discovered that it's good for their stomachs ,COMMA but it's better for their heads .PERIOD <BREAK>
I've actually eaten seven of those baskets and they're very good .PERIOD <BREAK>
Remember I'm the black kid from the ' 60 s who got his life saved with ceramics .PERIOD <BREAK>
Let me show you what these people do .PERIOD <BREAK>
We have a world class gallery because we believe that poor kids need a world class gallery ,COMMA so I designed this thing .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA he jumped in the van ,COMMA he went to Miss Jones' house and said ,COMMA Miss Jones ,COMMA I knew you wanted to come to your kid's art opening but you probably didn't have a ride .PERIOD <BREAK>
And there is no statistical difference between the white parents and the black parents .PERIOD <BREAK>
She said ,COMMA Well ,COMMA I work for a company called Hewlett-Packard .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I said ,COMMA Well ,COMMA there's an easy solution to that problem .PERIOD <BREAK>
He said ,COMMA Because I heard you built the center and I didn't believe that you did it ,COMMA and I wanted to see for myself .PERIOD <BREAK>
Well ,COMMA we did win ,COMMA and our name was literally in lights over Madison Square Garden .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that was our first recording studio ,COMMA which was the broom closet .PERIOD <BREAK>
And this is what I want to do when I grow up .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is in a place called San Francisco .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I said ,COMMA Herbie ,COMMA this is my concept of a training center for poor people .PERIOD <BREAK>
And now I really want to build one .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I promised these people that I was going to build this thing ,COMMA and we're going to build it all right .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I said ,COMMA If I can follow that music ,COMMA I'll get out into the sunlight and I'll be OK .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I don't think I'm crazy .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA 10 times more bacterial cells than human cells on a human being .PERIOD <BREAK>
At the best ,COMMA you're 10 percent human ,COMMA but more likely about one percent human ,COMMA depending on which of these metrics you like .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so we wanted to think if there couldn't be a different way that bacteria live .PERIOD <BREAK>
What you're looking at on this slide is just a person from my lab holding a flask of a liquid culture of a bacterium ,COMMA a harmless beautiful bacterium that comes from the ocean ,COMMA named Vibrio fischeri .PERIOD <BREAK>
We just took the picture by turning the lights off in the room ,COMMA and this is what we see .PERIOD <BREAK>
But when they grew to a certain cell number all the bacteria turned on light simultaneously .PERIOD <BREAK>
The question that we had is how can bacteria ,COMMA these primitive organisms ,COMMA tell the difference from times when they're alone ,COMMA and times when they're in a community ,COMMA and then all do something together .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is like the stealth bomber of the ocean .PERIOD <BREAK>
And then as the cells grow ,COMMA they're all releasing that molecule into the environment ,COMMA so there's lots of molecule there .PERIOD <BREAK>
But the one that's probably the most important to you is virulence .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is the Vibrio fischeri molecule .PERIOD <BREAK>
So then we started to look at other bacteria ,COMMA and these are just a smattering of the molecules that we've discovered .PERIOD <BREAK>
The left-hand part of the molecule is identical in every single species of bacteria .PERIOD <BREAK>
What that does is to confer exquisite species specificities to these languages .PERIOD <BREAK>
Each molecule fits into its partner receptor and no other .PERIOD <BREAK>
Each bacteria uses a particular molecule that's its language that allows it to count its own siblings .PERIOD <BREAK>
Anywhere on your body ,COMMA it looks pretty much like this ,COMMA and what I hope you can see is that there's all kinds of bacteria there .PERIOD <BREAK>
Couldn't these be new kinds of antibiotics ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And so now of course we have this global problem in infectious diseases .PERIOD <BREAK>
The first one is we've targeted the intraspecies communication system .PERIOD <BREAK>
I hope that what you've learned is that bacteria can distinguish self from other .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is exactly what happens in your body .PERIOD <BREAK>
But then ,COMMA to finish with a plug for all the good and miraculous bacteria that live on the Earth ,COMMA we've also made pro-quorum sensing molecules .PERIOD <BREAK>
Remember you have these 10 times or more bacterial cells in you or on you ,COMMA keeping you healthy .PERIOD <BREAK>
So I'm really a basic scientist ,COMMA not a clinician ,COMMA but in the last year and a half I've started to switch over ,COMMA to use what we've been learning about these patterns of activity to develop prosthetic devices ,COMMA and what I wanted to do today is show you an example of this .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's really our first foray into this .PERIOD <BREAK>
Like this pattern of pulses here actually means baby's face ,COMMA and so when the brain gets this pattern of pulses ,COMMA it knows that what was out there was a baby's face ,COMMA and if it got a different pattern it would know that what was out there was ,COMMA say ,COMMA a dog ,COMMA or another pattern would be a house .PERIOD <BREAK>
So this is what we've been working on ,COMMA and this is what our prosthetic does .PERIOD <BREAK>
So a completely blind retina ,COMMA even one with no front-end circuitry at all ,COMMA no photoreceptors ,COMMA can now send out normal signals ,COMMA signals that the brain can understand .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so with the standard method ,COMMA the cells do fire ,COMMA they just don't fire in the normal firing patterns because they don't have the right code .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is just actually the first one that we tried .PERIOD <BREAK>
So it's different from the motor prosthetics where you're communicating from the brain to a device .PERIOD Here we have to communicate from the outside world into the brain and be understood ,COMMA and be understood by the brain .PERIOD <BREAK>
You can just call it out .PERIOD <BREAK>
Who else ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
The worst flute players .PERIOD <BREAK>
Actually ,COMMA that was Aristotle's answer too .PERIOD <BREAK>
Peter :COLON The greatest benefit to all .PERIOD <BREAK>
The greatest benefit to all .PERIOD <BREAK>
All right .PERIOD <BREAK>
Aristotle had a different reason for saying the best flutes should go to the best flute players .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the point ,COMMA the essential nature ,COMMA of musical performance is to produce excellent music .PERIOD <BREAK>
Suppose you were on the Supreme Court .PERIOD <BREAK>
Suppose you were deciding the justice of this case .PERIOD <BREAK>
Raise your hand ,COMMA and we'll try to get you a microphone .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's part of the game of golf ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Charlie ,COMMA what do you say to Warren ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Warren :COLON I am not a golfer .PERIOD <BREAK>
He wouldn't have granted the cart ,COMMA and he had a very interesting dissent .PERIOD <BREAK>
But since it is the very nature of a game to have no object except amusement ,COMMA that is ,COMMA what distinguishes games from productive activity ,COMMA it is quite impossible to say that any of a game's arbitrary rules is essential .PERIOD <BREAK>
First ,COMMA no real sports fan would talk that way .PERIOD <BREAK>
On the face of it ,COMMA it seemed to be -- this debate about the golf cart -- an argument about fairness ,COMMA what's an unfair advantage .PERIOD <BREAK>
So if golfing is the kind of game that can be played while riding around in a golf cart ,COMMA it would be hard to confer on the golfing greats the status that we confer ,COMMA the honor and recognition that goes to truly great athletes .PERIOD <BREAK>
How many here favor the first policy :COLON the state should recognize traditional marriage only ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
I'm going to talk about why we have to get our shit together ,COMMA and actually talk about this a bit more than we do .PERIOD <BREAK>
That was easy .PERIOD OK .PERIOD <BREAK>
OK .PERIOD Hands up :COLON anyone in the audience who's not sure whether malaria is a good thing or a bad thing ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
You know ,COMMA a lot of people said ,COMMA Well ,COMMA you know ,COMMA city boys have no business telling us rural types what to do with our time .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's a global trance .PERIOD <BREAK>
But the question is ,COMMA are they so dangerous -- these risks of doing something about aging -- that they outweigh the downside of doing the opposite ,COMMA namely ,COMMA leaving aging as it is ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
People worry about overpopulation ;SEMICOLON they say ,COMMA Well ,COMMA if we fix aging ,COMMA no one's going to die to speak of ,COMMA or at least the death toll is going to be much lower ,COMMA only from crossing St .PERIOD Giles carelessly .PERIOD <BREAK>
This pro-aging trance is what stops us from agitating about these things .PERIOD <BREAK>
But it isn't .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA these trajectories here are basically how we would expect people to live ,COMMA in terms of remaining life expectancy ,COMMA as measured by their health ,COMMA for given ages that they were at the time that these therapies arrive .PERIOD <BREAK>
But if you're only 50 ,COMMA then there's a chance that you might be able to pull out of the dive and ,COMMA you know -- -- eventually get through this and start becoming biologically younger in a meaningful sense ,COMMA in terms of your youthfulness ,COMMA both physical and mental ,COMMA and in terms of your risk of death from age-related causes .PERIOD <BREAK>
And of course ,COMMA if you're a bit younger than that ,COMMA then you're never really even going to get near to being fragile enough to die of age-related causes .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that's quite a thought .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA in other words ,COMMA we add two years -- we treble their remaining lifespan ,COMMA starting from the point that we started the therapies .PERIOD <BREAK>
So we're likely to end up with a very strong change in people's attitudes ,COMMA and of course that has enormous implications .PERIOD <BREAK>
Because the critical thing about this is that even though the damage only eventually causes pathology ,COMMA the damage itself is caused ongoing-ly throughout life ,COMMA starting before we're born .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the reason it's a losing battle is because the damage is continuing to accumulate .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA these seven things were all under discussion in gerontology a long time ago and that is pretty good news ,COMMA because it means that ,COMMA you know ,COMMA we've come a long way in biology in these 20 years ,COMMA so the fact that we haven't extended this list is a pretty good indication that there's no extension to be done .PERIOD <BREAK>
And you know what happened .PERIOD <BREAK>
But ,COMMA I mean ,COMMA look -- how long does it take to spend that on the war in Iraq ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And I think we know how to do it .PERIOD And I'll stop there .PERIOD <BREAK>
Audience :COLON Species on this planet have evolved with immune systems to fight off all the diseases so that individuals live long enough to procreate .PERIOD <BREAK>
If I project that ,COMMA that would make me think that I would live until 120 if I don't crash on my motorbike .PERIOD <BREAK>
Ninety-nine pence was the starting price and no reserve .PERIOD <BREAK>
Then there was the volcano that interrupted the travel plans of almost all of you and many of your friends ,COMMA including President Obama .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'm here to tell you the story of Audur Capital ,COMMA which is a financial firm founded by me and Kristin -- who you see in the picture -- in the spring of 2007 ,COMMA just over a year before the economic collapse hit .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we believe that doing emotional due diligence is just as important as doing financial due diligence .PERIOD <BREAK>
So we like to see profits ,COMMA plus positive social and environmental benefits ,COMMA when we invest .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now that we've had all that happen ,COMMA and we have all this data out there telling us that it's much better to have diversity around the decision-making tables ,COMMA will we see business and finance change ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
I want to see more revolutionary thinking ,COMMA and I remain hopeful .PERIOD <BREAK>
For me it was the start of a long journey ,COMMA but I decided that day to matter .PERIOD <BREAK>
External debt -- something that I can tell you a long story about because I personally worked on one of the biggest debts on the continent -- has come down dramatically .PERIOD <BREAK>
Because we are confronted with a challenge .PERIOD <BREAK>
We need to bring it back to say ,COMMA what is the combination of all these factors that is going to yield what we want ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And I want to tell you something .PERIOD <BREAK>
The issue is not that .PERIOD <BREAK>
She was three years old and I was 15 .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now I put my sister on my back -- burning -- and I walked 10 kilometers with her strapped on my back .PERIOD <BREAK>
In about two to three hours ,COMMA she started to move .PERIOD <BREAK>
You know ,COMMA we have to use it well .PERIOD <BREAK>
For which many people ,COMMA even from other parts of the world ,COMMA are going there to find jobs .PERIOD <BREAK>
They are just discovering .PERIOD <BREAK>
Let's sit down and really tell you where the money should be channeled and where this aid should go .PERIOD <BREAK>
How can we get government to combine properly with these private foundations ,COMMA with the international organizations ,COMMA and with our private sector .PERIOD <BREAK>
Aid cannot solve our problems ,COMMA I'm firmly convinced about that .PERIOD <BREAK>
In fact ,COMMA the Chinese minister of finance said to me ,COMMA when I asked him what are we doing wrong in Nigeria .PERIOD <BREAK>
Infrastructure ,COMMA infrastructure ,COMMA infrastructure and discipline .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I repeat it for the continent .PERIOD <BREAK>
And lastly ,COMMA what are you going to do to be part of this partnership of aid ,COMMA government ,COMMA private sector and the African as an individual ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
I will say though that ,COMMA after having done surgery a lot ,COMMA it's somewhat similar to playing a musical instrument .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I'll tell you that most scientific studies of music ,COMMA they're very dense ,COMMA and when you actually go through them ,COMMA it's very hard to recognize the music in it .PERIOD <BREAK>
That blood flow causes an increase in local blood to that area with a deoxyhemoglobin change in concentration .PERIOD <BREAK>
Charles Limb :COLON This is a plastic MIDI piano keyboard that we use for the jazz experiments .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so what we did was we brought professional jazz players to the NIH ,COMMA and we had them memorize this piece of music on the left ,COMMA the lower-left -- which is what you heard me playing -- and then we had them improvise to the same exact chord changes .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I've listened to that solo 200 times ,COMMA and I still like it .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so we had this focal area called the medial prefrontal cortex that went way up in activity .PERIOD <BREAK>
We had this broad patch of area called the lateral prefrontal cortex that went way down in activity ,COMMA and I'll summarize that for you here .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now these are multifunctional areas of the brain .PERIOD <BREAK>
The fact that we do it over and over again lets you acclimate to your surroundings .PERIOD <BREAK>
So how do you study rap scientifically ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
With this big screen ,COMMA you can all rap with me .PERIOD Okay ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
He's just memorized a rhyme for us .PERIOD <BREAK>
And what we see ,COMMA we do see language areas lighting up ,COMMA but then -- eyes closed -- when you are free-styling versus memorizing ,COMMA you've got major visual areas lighting up .PERIOD <BREAK>
You have heightened brain activity when you're doing a comparable task ,COMMA when that one task is creative and the other task is memorized .PERIOD <BREAK>
I mean ,COMMA don't get me wrong .PERIOD Calculus is an important subject .PERIOD <BREAK>
And every student who studies math ,COMMA science ,COMMA engineering ,COMMA economics ,COMMA they should definitely learn calculus by the end of their freshman year of college .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's understanding data .PERIOD <BREAK>
Look ,COMMA the world has changed from analog to digital .PERIOD <BREAK>
The majority of our functional brain is distributed over the outer surface layer of the brain ,COMMA and to increase the area that's available for mental capacity ,COMMA the brain surface is highly folded .PERIOD <BREAK>
Our breakthrough was to create an algorithm that unfolds the cortex ,COMMA so that we can map the signals closer to its source ,COMMA and therefore making it capable of working across a mass population .PERIOD <BREAK>
The second challenge is the actual device for observing brainwaves .PERIOD <BREAK>
With neutral ,COMMA there's nothing in particular that Evan needs to do .PERIOD <BREAK>
It takes eight seconds to do this ,COMMA and now that that's done ,COMMA we can choose a movement-based action .PERIOD <BREAK>
So Evan ,COMMA choose something that you can visualize clearly in your mind .PERIOD <BREAK>
So the idea here now is that Evan needs to imagine the object coming forward into the screen ,COMMA and there's a progress bar that will scroll across the screen while he's doing that .PERIOD <BREAK>
The first time ,COMMA nothing will happen ,COMMA because the system has no idea how he thinks about pull .PERIOD <BREAK>
So :COLON one ,COMMA two ,COMMA three ,COMMA go .PERIOD <BREAK>
Okay .PERIOD <BREAK>
Ah ,COMMA good job !EXCLAMATIONMARK <BREAK>
That's really amazing .PERIOD <BREAK>
So what you want to do -- at least with movement-based actions ,COMMA we do that all the time ,COMMA so you can visualize it .PERIOD <BREAK>
So I'd like to show you a few examples ,COMMA because there are many possible applications for this new interface .PERIOD <BREAK>
And bed nets have an effect on the epidemic ,COMMA but you're never going to make it extinct with bed nets .PERIOD <BREAK>
We could spend hours going over this .PERIOD <BREAK>
It creates a very high peak power and it lets you do all kinds of interesting things ;SEMICOLON in particular ,COMMA it lets you find hemozoin .PERIOD <BREAK>
And using both this technique and other optical techniques ,COMMA we think we can make those diagnostics .PERIOD <BREAK>
We also have another hemozoin-oriented therapy for malaria :COLON a way ,COMMA in acute cases ,COMMA to actually take the malaria parasite and filter it out of the blood system .PERIOD <BREAK>
You can give drug administration .PERIOD <BREAK>
We have all of the precipitation data and the temperature data .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's very important because the humidity and precipitation tell you whether you've got standing pools of water for the mosquitoes to breed .PERIOD <BREAK>
So that sets the stage on which you do this .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA one of the ways you can make them not fly is with DDT .PERIOD <BREAK>
In 1935 ,COMMA there were 150000 cases a year of malaria in the United States ,COMMA but DDT and a massive public health effort managed to squelch it .PERIOD <BREAK>
Audience :COLON Yeah !EXCLAMATIONMARK <BREAK>
Nathan Myhrvold :COLON Okay ,COMMA so our legal department prepared a disclaimer ,COMMA and here it is .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA after thinking about this a little bit we thought ,COMMA you know ,COMMA it probably would be simpler to do this with a nonlethal laser .PERIOD <BREAK>
We have the device over here .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA that's a fairly straightforward image processing routine ,COMMA and let me show you how it works .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is very satisfying .PERIOD <BREAK>
It grows and is nurtured .PERIOD <BREAK>
Basically a restaurant just like any other .PERIOD <BREAK>
Chairs :COLON recycled and recyclable .PERIOD <BREAK>
I was experimenting with these -- I don't know if you can see it -- but there's a work surface there .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is the kitchen ,COMMA which is in the same room .PERIOD <BREAK>
Rather than me putting a dish down ,COMMA they were allowed to help themselves to as much or as little as they wanted .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is the waste room .PERIOD <BREAK>
In here ,COMMA I have produce and boxes that are unavoidable .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'm taking the temperature of the canal outside ,COMMA pumping it through the heat exchange mechanism ,COMMA it's turning through these amazing sails on the roof ,COMMA and that ,COMMA in turn ,COMMA is falling softly onto the people in the restaurant ,COMMA cooling them ,COMMA or heating them ,COMMA as the need may be .PERIOD <BREAK>
In the canal ,COMMA which is just outside the restaurant ,COMMA there is hundreds of meters of coil piping .PERIOD <BREAK>
He's growing all his own fruit ,COMMA and that's fantastic .PERIOD <BREAK>
So you've got to watch your space for that .PERIOD <BREAK>
Okay .PERIOD So this is my next project .PERIOD <BREAK>
I mean ,COMMA the whole thing is is super-sustainable .PERIOD <BREAK>
And no one's doing that just yet .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is a herd ,COMMA and it is built according to genetical codes .PERIOD <BREAK>
In fact ,COMMA it's a new invention of the wheel .PERIOD <BREAK>
In fact ,COMMA this is better than a wheel ,COMMA because when you try to drive with your bicycle on the beach ,COMMA you will notice it's very hard to do .PERIOD <BREAK>
OK .PERIOD Good .PERIOD <BREAK>
So as soon it has been to the sea ,COMMA it changes the pattern of zeroes and ones here ,COMMA and it knows always where it is on the beach .PERIOD So it's very simple brain .PERIOD <BREAK>
So it's a sort of imagination of the simple world of the beach animal .PERIOD <BREAK>
We did Haemophilus influenzae and then the smallest genome of a self-replicating organism ,COMMA that of Mycoplasma genitalium .PERIOD <BREAK>
In 2003 ,COMMA we published our first success .PERIOD <BREAK>
So Ham Smith and Clyde Hutchison developed some new methods for making error-free DNA at a small level .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we can walk through the reasons for that ,COMMA but basically the small cell took on the order of one to two months to get results from ,COMMA whereas the larger ,COMMA faster-growing cell takes only two days .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's an amazing step forward ,COMMA but we had a problem because now we had the bacterial chromosomes growing in yeast .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we thought this would be a great test bed for learning how to get chromosomes out of yeast and transplant them .PERIOD <BREAK>
We narrowed it down to one fragment ;SEMICOLON we sequenced it and found just one base pair had been deleted in an essential gene .PERIOD <BREAK>
we got a text from Dan saying that ,COMMA now ,COMMA the first blue colonies existed .PERIOD <BREAK>
So early on ,COMMA we developed the notion of putting in watermarks in the DNA to absolutely make clear that the DNA was synthetic .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's significant to us .PERIOD <BREAK>
So when you see how long it took to get an H 1 N 1 vaccine out ,COMMA we think we can shorten that process quite substantially .PERIOD <BREAK>
You may have heard about the Koran's idea of paradise being 72 virgins ,COMMA and I promise I will come back to those virgins .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's just 29 words in Arabic ,COMMA but anywhere from 65 to 72 in translation .PERIOD <BREAK>
But all is not lost in translation .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that number 72 never appears .PERIOD <BREAK>
There are no 72 virgins in the Koran .PERIOD <BREAK>
They all live in colonies consisting of one or a few queens ,COMMA and then all the ants you see walking around are sterile female workers .PERIOD <BREAK>
Here's my study site .PERIOD This is really a picture of ants ,COMMA and the rabbit just happens to be there .PERIOD <BREAK>
Ants never make more ants ;SEMICOLON colonies make more colonies .PERIOD <BREAK>
And this shows a recently virgin queen .PERIOD Here's her wings .PERIOD <BREAK>
She lays eggs ,COMMA she feeds the larvae -- so an ant starts as an egg ,COMMA then it's a larva .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA things happen to an ant colony .PERIOD <BREAK>
When it rains in the summer ,COMMA it floods in the desert .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that's the process that I call task allocation .PERIOD <BREAK>
That is ,COMMA that there are chambers inside ,COMMA they line the walls of the chambers with moist soil and it dries to a kind of an adobe-like surface in it .PERIOD <BREAK>
And finally ,COMMA the midden workers put some kind of territorial chemical in the garbage .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA an ant starts out somewhere near the queen .PERIOD <BREAK>
The queen's in there somewhere ;SEMICOLON she just lays eggs .PERIOD <BREAK>
So just to reinforce that what you might have thought about ant queens isn't true -- you know ,COMMA even if the queen did have the intelligence to send chemical messages through this whole network of chambers to tell the ants outside what to do ,COMMA there is no way that such messages could make it in time to see the shifts in the allocation of workers that we actually see outside the nest .PERIOD <BREAK>
We started out with model airplane paint and then we found these wonderful little Japanese markers ,COMMA and they work really well .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so just to summarize the result ,COMMA well it turns out that yes ,COMMA the different tasks are interdependent .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the second result ,COMMA which was surprising to a lot of people ,COMMA was that ants actually switch tasks .PERIOD <BREAK>
The same ant doesn't do the same task over and over its whole life .PERIOD <BREAK>
This process changes with colony age ,COMMA and it changes like this .PERIOD <BREAK>
Instead ,COMMA something about the organization must be changing as the colony gets older .PERIOD <BREAK>
And what we're learning is that an ant uses the pattern of its antennal contacts ,COMMA the rate at which it meets ants of other tasks ,COMMA in deciding what to do .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we've just recently demonstrated this by putting extract of hydrocarbons on little glass beads ,COMMA and dropping the beads gently down into the nest entrance at the right rate .PERIOD <BREAK>
So I want now to show you a bit of film -- and this will start out ,COMMA first of all ,COMMA showing you the nest entrance .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is taken through a fiber optics microscope .PERIOD It's down inside the nest .PERIOD <BREAK>
Each ant ,COMMA then ,COMMA as it comes back in ,COMMA is contacting other ants .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA what's interesting about this system is that it's messy .PERIOD <BREAK>
Again ,COMMA I don't want to say that this kind of haphazard pattern of interactions produces a factory that works with the precision and efficiency of clockwork .PERIOD <BREAK>
That we can take the whole idea that gave birth to the Internet and bring it down to the physical world in this Internet Zero ,COMMA this internet of devices .PERIOD <BREAK>
Unlike this screen where the dots are placed carefully ,COMMA this is a raw material .PERIOD <BREAK>
This was just a proof of principle he did of tiles that interact magnetically ,COMMA where you write a code ,COMMA much like protein folding ,COMMA that specifies their structure .PERIOD <BREAK>
But I had a problem .PERIOD Once I had all these machines ,COMMA I was spending too much time teaching students to use them .PERIOD <BREAK>
When a user screams into scream buddy ,COMMA their scream is silenced .PERIOD <BREAK>
But you don't use it for inventory and payroll ;SEMICOLON DEC is now twice bankrupt .PERIOD You don't need personal fabrication in the home to buy what you can buy because you can buy it .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the way you close it is not IT for the masses but IT development for the masses .PERIOD <BREAK>
You can see it in their face ,COMMA just this joy of ,COMMA I can do it .PERIOD <BREAK>
We designed a network sensor ,COMMA and kids would show up and refuse to leave the lab .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is late at ,COMMA you know ,COMMA 11 o'clock at night and I think I was the only person surprised when what she built worked the first time .PERIOD <BREAK>
And ,COMMA again ,COMMA that was just for the joy of it .PERIOD <BREAK>
And then ,COMMA in turn ,COMMA businesses started to grow ,COMMA like making these antennas .PERIOD <BREAK>
We're learning more from them than we're giving them .PERIOD <BREAK>
I was showing my kids in a Fab Lab how to use it .PERIOD <BREAK>
Real invention is happening in these labs .PERIOD <BREAK>
PDPs came between mainframes and minicomputers .PERIOD <BREAK>
It was there because they wanted to find animals in the mountains but it outgrew it ,COMMA so they built this extraordinary village for the lab .PERIOD <BREAK>
If this room full of heroes is just clever enough ,COMMA you can solve the problems .PERIOD <BREAK>
The message coming from the Fab Labs is that the other five billion people on the planet aren't just technical sinks ;SEMICOLON they're sources .PERIOD <BREAK>
That has got to be stopped .PERIOD <BREAK>
Somehow that doesn't seem right .PERIOD <BREAK>
So here we are using 20 million barrels a day -- producing eight ,COMMA importing 12 ,COMMA and from the 12 ,COMMA five comes from OPEC .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now I had people in Washington last week told me ,COMMA he said ,COMMA The Saudis can produce the oil for five dollars a barrel .PERIOD <BREAK>
We're headed to natural gas .PERIOD <BREAK>
Run it through the separator and you're ready to use it .PERIOD <BREAK>
Natural gas will fit all of those .PERIOD <BREAK>
It will replace or be able to be used for that .PERIOD <BREAK>
So I have tried to target on where we use the natural gas .PERIOD <BREAK>
And where I've targeted is on the heavy-duty trucks .PERIOD <BREAK>
There are eight million of them .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'm back to theorist again .PERIOD <BREAK>
So there's nothing going on that impresses me in Washington on that plan ,COMMA other than I'm trying to focus on that eight million 18 -wheelers .PERIOD <BREAK>
Thank you .PERIOD <BREAK>
That'll make you abandon something .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'm a geologist ,COMMA got out of school in ' 51 ,COMMA and I've been in the industry my entire life .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'm not a big natural gas producer .PERIOD <BREAK>
You've made the money you need .PERIOD <BREAK>
Does that make sense ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
The government is not successful on these things .PERIOD <BREAK>
But Chris ,COMMA I think where we're headed ,COMMA the long-term ,COMMA I don't mind going back to nuclear .PERIOD <BREAK>
There isn't anything wrong with nuke .PERIOD <BREAK>
TBP :COLON Fracking ?QUESTIONMARK What is fracking ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
I mean seriously ,COMMA the Department of Energy did not have anything to do with fracking .PERIOD <BREAK>
The first frack job was in ' 47 .PERIOD <BREAK>
There's no problems .PERIOD <BREAK>
If someone comes to you with a plan that really looks like it might be part of this solution ,COMMA are you ready to invest in those technologies ,COMMA even if they aren't maximized for profits ,COMMA they might be maximized for the future health of the planet ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
When you think about resilience and technology it's actually much easier .PERIOD <BREAK>
The Internet was also very real .PERIOD This is a real way for humans to communicate with each other .PERIOD It's a big deal .PERIOD <BREAK>
People on the East Coast in 1849 ,COMMA when they first started to get the news ,COMMA they thought ,COMMA Ah ,COMMA this isn't real .PERIOD <BREAK>
You had dotcom fever .PERIOD And you had gold fever .PERIOD <BREAK>
And they wouldn't let the other half out to go look for the first half because they were afraid they wouldn't come back .PERIOD <BREAK>
They had bad burn rate in the Gold Rush .PERIOD A very bad burn rate .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is a commercial that was played on the Super Bowl in the year 2000 .PERIOD <BREAK>

So there's a much better analogy that allows you to be incredibly optimistic and that analogy is the electric industry .PERIOD <BREAK>
This was a huge -- as you would expect -- a huge capital build out .PERIOD <BREAK>
Well ,COMMA it was because that heavy infrastructure had already been laid down .PERIOD <BREAK>
They would -- each room typically had a light bulb socket at the top .PERIOD <BREAK>
And there's a rotor there -- that this motor is spinning .PERIOD <BREAK>
And they were really happy that the guy had a speakerphone because then they had to wait on hold for an hour to talk to somebody to give them an access code after they got there .PERIOD <BREAK>
Because ,COMMA you know ,COMMA resilience -- if you think of it in terms of the Gold Rush ,COMMA then you'd be pretty depressed right now because the last nugget of gold would be gone .PERIOD <BREAK>
She -- but you know ,COMMA if you really do believe that it's the very ,COMMA very beginning ,COMMA if you believe it's the 1908 Hurley washing machine ,COMMA then you're incredibly optimistic .PERIOD And I do think that that's where we are .PERIOD <BREAK>
The golden rule is great .PERIOD I'm a big supporter of both .PERIOD <BREAK>
In the beginning ,COMMA there was compassion ,COMMA and I mean not just when human beings first showed up ,COMMA but actually even before that .PERIOD <BREAK>
I warned you this was not going to be very warm and fuzzy .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA there's more good news that came along later in evolution ,COMMA a second kind of evolutionary logic .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so ,COMMA you wind up most easily extending compassion to friends and allies .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA I hope I've got your attention with this promise of good news that may save the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
Basically ,COMMA a zero-sum game is the kind you're used to in sports ,COMMA where there's a winner and a loser .PERIOD <BREAK>
Either way ,COMMA your fortunes add up to zero .PERIOD That's a zero-sum game .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA if you're playing doubles ,COMMA then the person on your side of the net is in a non-zero-sum relationship with you ,COMMA because every point is either good for both of you -- positive ,COMMA win-win -- or bad for both of you ,COMMA it's lose-lose .PERIOD <BREAK>
The deployment of the golden rule most naturally happens along these non-zero-sum channels .PERIOD <BREAK>
With zero-sum channels you would expect something else .PERIOD <BREAK>
But it may .PERIOD And the good news is that history has naturally expanded these webs of non-zero-sumness ,COMMA these webs that can be these channels for compassion .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's the story of civilization .PERIOD <BREAK>
And also ,COMMA sometimes people don't recognize the non-zero-sum dynamics in the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
I think politicians can help foster non-zero-sum relationships ,COMMA Economic engagement is generally better than blockades and so on ,COMMA in this regard .PERIOD <BREAK>
If there's one thing I can encourage everyone to do ,COMMA politicians ,COMMA religious leaders ,COMMA and us ,COMMA it would be what I call expanding the moral imagination -- that is to say ,COMMA your ability to put yourself in the shoes of people in very different circumstances .PERIOD <BREAK>
Once upon a time ,COMMA I did a book called How Buildings Learn .PERIOD <BREAK>
So the design problem for today is going to be ,COMMA how do you house an eventual monumental clock like this so it can really tick ,COMMA save time beautifully for 100 centuries ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And it looked like a way to go ,COMMA until you start thinking about ,COMMA what does deep time do to a building ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
This is the Parthenon .PERIOD It's only 2450 years old ,COMMA and look what happened to it .PERIOD <BREAK>
And now it's a pathetic ruin and no one even knows what it was used for .PERIOD <BREAK>
Underground in a place that's really solid .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's right on the eastern border of Nevada .PERIOD <BREAK>
It starts with the image .PERIOD The image is a picture you have in your mind of the goal at the end of the journey .PERIOD <BREAK>
The labyrinth is a concept ,COMMA it's like a twilight zone ,COMMA it's a place where it's difficult ,COMMA where you get disoriented ,COMMA maybe you get scared -- but you have to go through it if you're going to get to some kind of deep reintegration .PERIOD <BREAK>
The Hillis algorithm .PERIOD 10 factorial gives you that number .PERIOD <BREAK>
Something you didn't expect that caps what you did expect .PERIOD <BREAK>
And then ,COMMA how about a memento ?QUESTIONMARK Number seven .PERIOD <BREAK>
What are the elements that will most affect your ideas and decisions ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
People think they're just the size of shrubs ,COMMA but that's not actually true .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's interesting .PERIOD <BREAK>
But it goes a mile-and-a-half in a straight line ,COMMA due east into the range ,COMMA into very interesting territory -- except that ,COMMA as you'll see when we go inside in a minute ,COMMA we were hoping for limestone but in there is just shale .PERIOD <BREAK>
Competent rock is rock that will hold itself up without any shoring .PERIOD <BREAK>
You may recognize a couple of the miners there .PERIOD <BREAK>
And Alexander Rose on the left there worked with a bunch of people from the National Park to survey the whole mine .PERIOD It's a mile deep .PERIOD <BREAK>
Kurt Bollacker and Alexander Rose designed a radically wireless station .PERIOD <BREAK>
But there's no bears ,COMMA and there's no poison oak ,COMMA and there's basically no people because this place has been empty for a long time .PERIOD <BREAK>
Well ,COMMA here's a potential approach .PERIOD <BREAK>
You need to come up the Lincoln Canyon .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's a secret passage .PERIOD It's like something from Tolkien .PERIOD <BREAK>
And then ,COMMA of course ,COMMA the next thing I hear is ,COMMA I've made it to the top .PERIOD You can see all of creation from up here .PERIOD <BREAK>
In fact ,COMMA there he is .PERIOD That's Alexander Rose .PERIOD <BREAK>
This discovery changed everything about our sense of these cliffs and what to do with them .PERIOD <BREAK>
So even with the slowing of the rotation of the earth and so on ,COMMA the clock will keep perfectly good time .PERIOD <BREAK>
So here we're looking from the south ,COMMA look north .PERIOD <BREAK>
Over on the eastern side it's gentle ,COMMA as you can see .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that's not snow -- that's what the white limestone looks like .PERIOD <BREAK>
Another is the experience in the mountain .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the third is the experience from the mountain ,COMMA which is really dominated by the view shed of the spring valley there behind Danny ,COMMA and if you look off to the right ,COMMA out there ,COMMA 15 miles across to the Schell Creek range .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is Rocky Mountain junipers that have been there for thousands of years .PERIOD <BREAK>
OK ,COMMA let's take one more look at the mountain itself .PERIOD <BREAK>
And this stone takes a perfect polish .PERIOD <BREAK>
Most of the amazingness of the clock we can borrow from the amazingness of the mountain .PERIOD <BREAK>
And often ,COMMA I'm driving in a taxi and I see a hole in a shirt ,COMMA or something that looks very interesting or pretty or functional in some way that I'd never seen happen before .PERIOD <BREAK>
I don't know where inspiration comes from .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I think about ,COMMA you know ,COMMA their roles ,COMMA and about how you have to ,COMMA like ,COMMA watch what your daughters look at .PERIOD <BREAK>
So actually ,COMMA check this out .PERIOD <BREAK>
I was dating this guy ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
I was dating this guy and it was going on for about a year ,COMMA right .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I kind of try not to look back ,COMMA you know .PERIOD <BREAK>
And frankly ,COMMA I don't really know what to call myself .PERIOD <BREAK>
Too much time on computer bridge ,COMMA which is ,COMMA you know ,COMMA like that's so .PERIOD somehow ,COMMA like ,COMMA about ten years ago I thought that the most unboring place in the world would be like a TV .PERIOD studio ,COMMA like for a day show .PERIOD Some kind of day talk show .PERIOD <BREAK>
Because it's all of these things that I love all kind of in one place .PERIOD <BREAK>
Hi there .PERIOD <BREAK>
ROD :COLON Cutting hair .PERIOD <BREAK>
Just checking ,COMMA because some people want to look ,COMMA you know ,COMMA aggressively ugly .PERIOD <BREAK>
A :COLON Oh no ,COMMA we're just staging ,COMMA ROD :COLON We're just staging it .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'll tell you that I cook a lot also .PERIOD I love to cook .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is what I've been doing because I think it's the most fun thing in the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's got a lot of different things on it .PERIOD <BREAK>
Yeah ,COMMA but I can never find buttermilk ,COMMA ever .PERIOD <BREAK>
Chef :COLON For cream ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Have you ever wondered how such a situation can be turned around ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Have you ever looked at the Arab uprisings and thought ,COMMA How could we have predicted that ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
But I believe now that we're moving into a new age ,COMMA and that age The New York Times dubbed recently as the age of behavior .PERIOD <BREAK>
And these ideas and narratives that bump people across borders are increasingly beginning to affect the way in which people behave .PERIOD <BREAK>
If we look at Islamists ,COMMA if we look at the phenomenon of far-right fascists ,COMMA one thing they've been very good at ,COMMA one thing that they've actually been exceeding in ,COMMA is communicating across borders ,COMMA using technologies to organize themselves ,COMMA to propagate their message and to create truly global phenomena .PERIOD <BREAK>
But having been born in Essex ,COMMA at the age of 16 ,COMMA I joined an organization .PERIOD <BREAK>
By the age of 24 ,COMMA I found myself convicted in prison in Egypt ,COMMA being blacklisted from three countries in the world for attempting to overthrow their governments ,COMMA being subjected to torture in Egyptian jails and sentenced to five years as a prisoner of conscience .PERIOD <BREAK>
The age of behavior :COLON where ideas and narratives were increasingly defining behavior and identity and allegiances .PERIOD <BREAK>
In certain countries ,COMMA mosque minarets are being banned .PERIOD <BREAK>
And why are democracy aspirants falling behind ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
So the ideas and the narratives of Al-Qaeda come to your mind immediately .PERIOD <BREAK>
One of their leaders was killed in Pakistan recently .PERIOD <BREAK>
To go around saying that I believe democratic culture is the best that we've arrived at as a form of political organizing is associated with extremism .PERIOD <BREAK>
When talking about those reasons ,COMMA let's break down certain preconceptions .PERIOD <BREAK>
But without freedom of speech ,COMMA you can't have free and fair elections .PERIOD <BREAK>
In the ' 80 s and ' 90 s when Islamism started in the region ,COMMA it spread across the MENA region as a whole .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now that's a big claim .PERIOD I'm going to try to back it up .PERIOD <BREAK>
Slow ,COMMA text-based conversations ,COMMA then real-time voice based conversations .PERIOD <BREAK>
He traces the edges of the individual networks and then color codes them .PERIOD <BREAK>
But they weren't given that choice ,COMMA because their own citizens beat them to the punch .PERIOD <BREAK>
Essentially to say ,COMMA We will do anything to placate you ,COMMA just please stop protesting in public .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so the protest kept going .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so they began to arrest the protesters .PERIOD <BREAK>
All of that is over .PERIOD <BREAK>
He had said ,COMMA in January ,COMMA that he would not sign a bill that granted telecom immunity for possibly warrantless spying on American persons .PERIOD <BREAK>
It was Senator Obama when they created it .PERIOD They changed the name later .PERIOD <BREAK>
He had to issue a reply .PERIOD <BREAK>
And he said essentially ,COMMA I have considered the issue .PERIOD <BREAK>
Media ,COMMA the media landscape that we knew ,COMMA as familiar as it was ,COMMA as easy conceptually as it was to deal with the idea that professionals broadcast messages to amateurs ,COMMA is increasingly slipping away .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's the media environment we've got .PERIOD <BREAK>
And today ,COMMA after the global economic crisis ,COMMA there was a whole new set of rules about how the state should intervene .PERIOD <BREAK>
The first ,COMMA to my mind ,COMMA is what I call as the ideas that have arrived .PERIOD <BREAK>
We thought of people as a liability .PERIOD <BREAK>
This change has contributed to the vitality and the whole economy .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the fact that we have English is now becoming a huge strategic asset .PERIOD <BREAK>
One is the question of education .PERIOD <BREAK>
The third thing is again cities .PERIOD <BREAK>
But today ,COMMA finally ,COMMA after economic reforms ,COMMA and economic growth ,COMMA I think the notion that cities are engines of economic growth ,COMMA cities are engines of creativity ,COMMA cities are engines of innovation ,COMMA have finally been accepted .PERIOD <BREAK>
A lot of the Indian problems are related to the ideology of caste and other things .PERIOD <BREAK>
Therefore we will fundamentally rethink the way we look at the environment ,COMMA the way we look at energy ,COMMA the way we create whole new paradigms of development .PERIOD <BREAK>
Why does what's happening 10 thousand miles away matter to all of you ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And that makes a huge difference .PERIOD <BREAK>
When India was growing at about three ,COMMA 35 percent and the population was growing at two percent ,COMMA its per capita income was doubling every 45 years .PERIOD <BREAK>
I've been there six times :COLON Four times I did work with National Geographic ,COMMA making tectonic plate measurements ;SEMICOLON twice ,COMMA I went with NASA doing remote sensing devices .PERIOD <BREAK>
That gives you an idea of just how severe things are near the summit .PERIOD <BREAK>
There were three other expeditions on the mountain ,COMMA an American team ,COMMA a New Zealand team and an IMAX team .PERIOD <BREAK>
And from there we climb up to Camp Two ,COMMA which is sort of the foreground .PERIOD <BREAK>
If you notice ,COMMA the summit of Everest is black .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is not good weather to climb in ,COMMA so the climbers are just waiting ,COMMA hoping that the wind's going to die down .PERIOD <BREAK>
The summit would be in the foreground .PERIOD <BREAK>
But what happened that year was the wind suddenly and unexpectedly picked up .PERIOD <BREAK>
I have an oxygen hose connected here .PERIOD <BREAK>
OK ,COMMA this is a view taken on the summit ridge itself .PERIOD <BREAK>
But ,COMMA either way ,COMMA you fall for the rest of your life .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is taken from Camp Three ,COMMA where I was .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA as the climbers came by me ,COMMA I sort of assessed whether or not they were in condition to continue on further down .PERIOD <BREAK>
His wife was home in New Zealand ,COMMA seven months pregnant with their first child ,COMMA and Rob asked to be patched into her .PERIOD That was done ,COMMA and Rob and his wife had their last conversation .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's a tackle box filled with medical supplies .PERIOD <BREAK>
What we did was try to warm them up as best we could ,COMMA put oxygen on them and try to revive them ,COMMA which is difficult to do at 21000 feet ,COMMA when the tent is freezing .PERIOD <BREAK>
As I was taking care of these climbers ,COMMA we got a startling experience .PERIOD <BREAK>
But Beck wasn't dead ;SEMICOLON he heard that ,COMMA but he was completely unable to move .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA you go to this one and you see how much more the frontal lobes are lighting up .PERIOD <BREAK>
He's trying to get his muscles going and get out of this .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's too cold ;SEMICOLON he can't keep his metabolic fires going ,COMMA and ,COMMA you see ,COMMA there's no more red here ;SEMICOLON his brain is quieting down .PERIOD <BREAK>
He's thinking about what he's got to do to save himself .PERIOD <BREAK>
He's not thinking about his family now ,COMMA and he's getting himself motivated .PERIOD <BREAK>
A helicopter came in at 21000 feet and carried out the highest helicopter rescue in history .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's our trailer ,COMMA because I know ,COMMA obviously you guys are busy ,COMMA many of you may not have had a chance to see it .PERIOD <BREAK>
If we could roll ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Michael Moriarty's Wife :COLON It's really hard for him to not have his dad .PERIOD <BREAK>
They're shooting at me .PERIOD <BREAK>
Deborah Scranton :COLON Thank you .PERIOD <BREAK>
We were one of the lucky ones to get in the class with the Sony cameras and the Vista software .PERIOD <BREAK>
I mean ,COMMA we were there for an hour ,COMMA talking .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it really highlighted something that I would like to ask you guys to think about and hopefully to help with ,COMMA which is ,COMMA I think a lot of us are very afraid to have conversations about war ,COMMA and about politics .PERIOD <BREAK>
How do we open it up to really be able to have a conversation ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
It was mass casualties .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is blood .PERIOD <BREAK>
Five soldiers filmed the entire time .PERIOD <BREAK>
They spent their entire day outside the wire trying to save Iraqi lives -- the Iraqis who work on the post .PERIOD <BREAK>
And for me ,COMMA it's trying to bridge that disconnect .PERIOD <BREAK>
I get -- I'm often asked ,COMMA you know ,COMMA for me ,COMMA what have been some of the special moments from having worked on this film .PERIOD <BREAK>
And he looked at me ,COMMA and I smiled ,COMMA and then I saw the tears start welling up in his eyes .PERIOD <BREAK>
So when I talk about a disconnect ,COMMA it's not only for maybe those people who don't know a soldier ,COMMA which there obviously are .PERIOD You know ,COMMA these days ,COMMA it's not like World War II ,COMMA where there was a war front and a home front ,COMMA and everybody seemed involved .PERIOD <BREAK>
Do you give money to any of the charities ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Do you really care ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And it was something called EcoRock .PERIOD <BREAK>
And they worked absolutely very ,COMMA very ,COMMA very hard .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's the finished production line there .PERIOD <BREAK>
We must change everything .PERIOD <BREAK>
So let's first talk about focused ultrasound .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I hold in my hand a tissue-mimicking phantom .PERIOD <BREAK>
It is transparent ,COMMA made just for you .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is a setup I put in a physics lab .PERIOD <BREAK>
We need to reach a target inside the brain .PERIOD <BREAK>
But you may not know that he tried to perform lobotomies in the brain ,COMMA noninvasively ,COMMA with focused ultrasound in the ' 50 s .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it makes you ponder why those pioneers failed .PERIOD <BREAK>
They were missing the vision .PERIOD <BREAK>
It is approved under an FDAIDE at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville using focused ultrasound to ablate a point in his thalamus .PERIOD <BREAK>
We attach a transducer ,COMMA in this case ,COMMA to the brain ,COMMA but if it will be a different organ ,COMMA it will be a different transducer attached to the patient .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's a target in the thalamus .PERIOD <BREAK>
It doesn't do any damage ,COMMA but it elevates the temperature by a few degrees .PERIOD <BREAK>
But here we can get both the anatomical imaging and the temperature maps in real time .PERIOD <BREAK>
So once the physician verifies that the focus spot is on the target he has chosen ,COMMA then we move to perform a full-energy ablation like you see here .PERIOD <BREAK>
And you have to understand what is in people's mind when they are willing to take the risk .PERIOD <BREAK>
They drove like three hours from their farm to the hospital .PERIOD <BREAK>
So again ,COMMA this is an immediate relief .PERIOD <BREAK>
I don't see ,COMMA without this nation taking it as some collective will or something that is a national goal to make that happen ,COMMA it will not happen .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it's not just because of regulation ;SEMICOLON it's because of the amount of money needed under the current evidence-based medicine and the size of trials and so on to make it happen .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we have better-than-surgery results in breasts .PERIOD <BREAK>
Women suffer from that disease .PERIOD <BREAK>
In the fashion industry ,COMMA there's very little intellectual property protection .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's because it's a lot harder for knock-off artists to knock off these designs because they can't knock off the logo .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA the reason for this ,COMMA the reason that the fashion industry doesn't have any copyright protection is because the courts decided long ago that apparel is too utilitarian to qualify for copyright protection .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA fashion designers have the broadest palette imaginable in this creative industry .PERIOD <BREAK>
People think this is a magical thing .PERIOD How does it happen ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Johanna Blakley :COLON Imagine that .PERIOD <BREAK>
They make deals with the fast fashion giants and they come up with a way to sell their product to a whole new demographic :COLON the Santee Alley demographic .PERIOD <BREAK>
Very low novelty standard ,COMMA anybody can register anything .PERIOD <BREAK>
That is a very difficult question to answer .PERIOD <BREAK>
Fireworks displays ,COMMA the rules of games ,COMMA the smell of perfume :COLON no .PERIOD <BREAK>
It is more complex than this ,COMMA but this will do .PERIOD <BREAK>
The problem is that digital technology has completely subverted the logic of this physically fixed ,COMMA expression versus idea concept .PERIOD <BREAK>
This individual lives in the Atacama Desert in Chile ,COMMA and it happens to be 3000 years old .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I'm also trying to create a means in which to step outside our quotidian experience of time and to start to consider a deeper timescale .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'd been traveling in Japan without an agenda other than to photograph ,COMMA and then I heard about this tree that is 2180 years old and knew that I had to go visit it .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is a clonal tree as well .PERIOD <BREAK>
I spoke to the biologist who discovered this tree ,COMMA and he told me that that spindly growth you see there in the center is most likely a product of climate change .PERIOD <BREAK>
Does anybody know how old the oldest tortoise is -- any guesses ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And then ,COMMA you might have heard of this giant clam that was discovered off the coast of northern Iceland that reached 405 years old .PERIOD <BREAK>
However ,COMMA it died in the lab as they were determining its age .PERIOD <BREAK>
I had the opportunity to travel around the Limpopo Province in South Africa with an expert in Baobab trees .PERIOD <BREAK>
They contain thousands of years of their own histories within themselves ,COMMA and they also contain records of natural and human events .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it actually never sheds those leaves ,COMMA so it also bears the distinction of having the longest leaves in the plant kingdom .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is something called an underground forest .PERIOD <BREAK>
The tree can easily recover .PERIOD <BREAK>
But what's unique about it is that it's doing DNA repair below freezing .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's my hope that ,COMMA by going to find these organisms ,COMMA that I can help draw attention to their remarkable resilience and help play a part in insuring their continued longevity into the foreseeable future .PERIOD <BREAK>
Our leaders and ourselves want everything ,COMMA but we don't talk about the costs .PERIOD <BREAK>
And when we would gather as fellows ,COMMA she would push us to think about how the elders in Native American culture make decisions .PERIOD <BREAK>
They said they would try so hard to remember the fragments of the dance ,COMMA hoping that others were alive and doing the same .PERIOD <BREAK>
But we find those entrepreneurs who put people and the planet before profit .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it's only when we honor them and celebrate them and give them status that the world will really change .PERIOD <BREAK>
For two years ,COMMA he hardly made any money ,COMMA a tiny stipend ,COMMA but he apprenticed with this incredible housing developer named Tasneem Saddiqui .PERIOD <BREAK>
He said ,COMMA Long story .PERIOD <BREAK>
We can take the easier road ,COMMA the more cynical road ,COMMA which is a road based on sometimes dreams of a past that never really was ,COMMA a fear of each other ,COMMA distancing and blame .PERIOD <BREAK>
I had the great honor of working with the child psychologist Dr .PERIOD Robert Coles ,COMMA who stood up for change during the Civil Rights movement in the United States .PERIOD <BREAK>
My final story is about a young ,COMMA beautiful man named Josephat Byaruhanga ,COMMA who was another Acumen Fund fellow ,COMMA who hails from Uganda ,COMMA a farming community .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we placed him in a company in Western Kenya ,COMMA just 200 miles away .PERIOD <BREAK>
And he said to me at the end of his year ,COMMA Jacqueline ,COMMA it was so humbling ,COMMA because I thought as a farmer and as an African I would understand how to transcend culture .PERIOD <BREAK>
Robert Kennedy once said that few of us have the greatness to bend history itself ,COMMA but each of us can work to change a small portion of events .PERIOD <BREAK>
But we do not know his face .PERIOD <BREAK>
I find that hard to believe .PERIOD <BREAK>
It also has to be sufficiently detailed .PERIOD <BREAK>
All we did was look for portraits that had the characteristics of a self-portrait ,COMMA and look ,COMMA they are very similar .PERIOD <BREAK>
They are made in the right order .PERIOD <BREAK>
It has stored ,COMMA recorded ,COMMA can fastly retrieve the meanings of thousands ,COMMA tens of thousands of objects ,COMMA actions ,COMMA and their relationships in the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now movement has advanced to the point where it can actually control movement simultaneously ,COMMA in a complex sequence ,COMMA in complex ways as would be required for example for playing a complicated game ,COMMA like soccer .PERIOD <BREAK>
You could go out into the community in Monterey ,COMMA and you'd have difficulty finding a boy that has this ability .PERIOD <BREAK>
And in fact they result in a wonderful differentiation in humankind ,COMMA in the way that ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA no two of us are quite alike .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we try to track the changes that occur as the new skill or ability is acquired .PERIOD <BREAK>
From these studies we defined two great epochs of the plastic history of the brain .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that is the period in which the brain is setting up in its initial form its basic processing machinery .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I see the brain actually develop a processor that is specialized -- specialized for that complex array ,COMMA a repertoire of sounds .PERIOD <BREAK>
He's successful in his retrieval of food with this tool every time .PERIOD <BREAK>
We can look down in the brain of the monkey .PERIOD <BREAK>
We've actually distorted the map by the exercise .PERIOD <BREAK>
And each one of them changes in ways that are specific to the skill or ability .PERIOD <BREAK>
It represents changes of hundreds of millions ,COMMA possibly billions of synaptic connections in your brain .PERIOD <BREAK>
That is why you ,COMMA in your many skills and abilities ,COMMA are a unique specialist :COLON a specialist that's vastly different in your physical brain in detail than the brain of an individual 100 years ago ;SEMICOLON enormously different in the details from the brain of the average individual 1000 years ago .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's not English .PERIOD It's noisy English .PERIOD <BREAK>
Changing it in detail .PERIOD It takes about 30 hours on the average .PERIOD <BREAK>
You can see that most of the children on the left side of the distribution are moving into the middle or the right .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is a substantially large impact .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'm specifically interested in things like autism ,COMMA and cerebral palsy ,COMMA these great childhood catastrophes .PERIOD <BREAK>
But also in your future is brain aerobics .PERIOD <BREAK>
Get ready for it .PERIOD It's going to be a part of every life not too far in the future ,COMMA just like physical exercise is a part of every well organized life in the contemporary period .PERIOD <BREAK>
Of course a lot of people will ignore this advice .PERIOD <BREAK>
And one of the stories he told me so often when I was a young boy was of the first British atomic bomb test .PERIOD <BREAK>
What he was trying to do with me was to inspire me to protect the world ,COMMA and show me just how fragile the world is .PERIOD <BREAK>
I love the place .PERIOD <BREAK>
Fresh water freezes at zero .PERIOD <BREAK>
I remember just trying to get out of the water .PERIOD <BREAK>
And for a swimmer ,COMMA you need to feel your hands because you need to be able to grab the water and pull it through with you .PERIOD <BREAK>
We are going to actually have to take them off .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I remember looking into the ice ,COMMA and there were big chunks of white ice in there ,COMMA and the water was completely black .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's a very frightening ,COMMA very ,COMMA very frightening thought .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's all a little bit frightening ,COMMA and emotional .PERIOD <BREAK>
The first thing we need to do is we need to break this problem down into manageable chunks .PERIOD <BREAK>
I've just come back from giving a series of speeches in some of the poorest townships in South Africa to young children as young as 10 years old .PERIOD <BREAK>
We need to believe in ourselves .PERIOD <BREAK>
But the most important thing we must do is ,COMMA I think ,COMMA we must all walk to the end of our lives and turn around ,COMMA and ask ourselves a most fundamental question .PERIOD <BREAK>
You take about eight or so carbon atoms ,COMMA about 20 hydrogen atoms ,COMMA you put them together in exactly the right way and you get this marvelous liquid :COLON very energy-dense and very easy to refine into a number of very useful products and fuels .PERIOD <BREAK>
But what about oil ?QUESTIONMARK Where is it in the energy system ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And that continues into the future with the renewables that we're developing today ,COMMA reaching maybe 30 percent of primary energy by mid century .PERIOD <BREAK>
I picked it up outside of Marble Falls ,COMMA Texas .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it's different than this limestone ,COMMA you can see that .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA millions of abalone every year make this shell .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's the same stuff as this and the same stuff as this .PERIOD <BREAK>
And why ?QUESTIONMARK Because the lowly abalone is able to lay down the calcium carbonate crystals in layers ,COMMA making this beautiful ,COMMA iridescent mother of pearl .PERIOD <BREAK>
Very specialized material that the abalone self-assembles ,COMMA millions of abalone ,COMMA all the time ,COMMA every day ,COMMA every year .PERIOD <BREAK>
How the molecules are put together .PERIOD <BREAK>
Here's a piece of coal .PERIOD <BREAK>
No wonder that most of the most important international operators in Germany ,COMMA but also in France and the UK and Scandinavia ,COMMA everywhere ,COMMA systematically bribed .PERIOD <BREAK>
They are not as good at bribing as many of their international competitors are ,COMMA but they were not allowed to show their strengths ,COMMA because the world was eaten up by grand corruption .PERIOD <BREAK>
In the first session -- we had three sessions over the course of two years .PERIOD <BREAK>
They even applaud it .PERIOD <BREAK>
The World Bank has turned from Saulus to Paulus ;SEMICOLON under Wolfensohn ,COMMA they became ,COMMA I would say ,COMMA the strongest anti-corruption agency in the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
They have to have a much more transparent financial governance .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that's what it's about .PERIOD <BREAK>
We use portraiture as a way to deliver those lives ,COMMA but that's it .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I thought really what we need is an elders program to just sit at the feet of amazing people and hear them talk .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's Barbara Walters and others like that ,COMMA and we like that .PERIOD <BREAK>
And he had never appeared in public since that point .PERIOD <BREAK>
And she said ,COMMA Well ,COMMA something very weird was happening .PERIOD <BREAK>
I didn't know what was going on ,COMMA but I was so part of the process of getting that out .PERIOD <BREAK>
These were people through their 90 s .PERIOD <BREAK>
But after the interview ,COMMA I got a call ,COMMA very gruff voice ,COMMA from a woman .PERIOD <BREAK>
Never ever get up on a stage with somebody who's modest ,COMMA because all of these people have been assembled to listen to them ,COMMA and they sit there and they say ,COMMA Aw ,COMMA shucks ,COMMA it was an accident .PERIOD <BREAK>
The worst interview I ever did :COLON William L .PERIOD Shirer .PERIOD <BREAK>
And she stonewalled me .PERIOD It was unbelievable .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's the problem here ,COMMA and she's fighting me for that ,COMMA and so then I asked her a question -- I didn't know how I was going to get out of it -- I asked her a question about her days as a playwright ,COMMA and again ,COMMA characteristically ,COMMA instead of saying ,COMMA Oh yes ,COMMA I was a playwright ,COMMA and this is what blah blah blah ,COMMA she said ,COMMA Oh ,COMMA playwright .PERIOD Everybody knows I was a playwright .PERIOD <BREAK>
She wanted the control of her final moment ,COMMA and she did it amazingly .PERIOD <BREAK>
His father was an SOB ,COMMA and ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA he was another comedian with an unhappy childhood ,COMMA but then we were off and running .PERIOD <BREAK>
Again ,COMMA some of you will know him ,COMMA most of you won't ,COMMA Dumas Malone .PERIOD <BREAK>
And here is this man who had given his whole life to uncovering Jefferson and connecting with him ,COMMA and he said ,COMMA Well .PERIOD -- I'm going to do a bad southern accent .PERIOD <BREAK>
I have a story ,COMMA a story that I would like to share with you .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it's an African story .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so maybe you're thinking now ,COMMA why ,COMMA how ,COMMA an Italian filmmaker based in Boston is so interested in this story ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And I was born in Zambia .PERIOD <BREAK>
I have the good fortune of being a filmmaker-in-residence at the Center of Digital Imaging Arts at Boston University .PERIOD <BREAK>
There are several themes from the documentary ,COMMA but they are re-edited and made for you ,COMMA OK ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Milverton Nwokedi :COLON You cut a nice movie with just 10000 dollars in Nigeria here .PERIOD <BREAK>
They can afford to watch their Robocop and whatever .PERIOD <BREAK>
Because nobody believed that Nollywood can come out of Africa .PERIOD <BREAK>
Narrator :COLON Suspense ,COMMA fun and intrigue .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's the blockbuster comedy .PERIOD <BREAK>
It is not what you hear ,COMMA you know ,COMMA from the Western press .PERIOD <BREAK>
Man :COLON Let's go .PERIOD <BREAK>
Like they go ,COMMA here ,COMMA now ,COMMA now ,COMMA you see the gun there ,COMMA but you won't see any guns shot ,COMMA we use knock-out .PERIOD <BREAK>
Kevin Books Ikeduba :COLON What I'm scared of is just the explosion will come up in my face .PERIOD <BREAK>
You know ,COMMA this is Nollywood ,COMMA where the magic lives .PERIOD <BREAK>
But always with a smile ,COMMA always with an enthusiasm ,COMMA that is incredible .PERIOD <BREAK>
The Nigerian filmmakers really ,COMMA really ,COMMA are doing what they like .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so it's a very ,COMMA very important thing for them ,COMMA and for their audiences .PERIOD <BREAK>
Filmmakers ,COMMA friends of mine ,COMMA they look at Nollywood and they say ,COMMA Wow ,COMMA they are doing what we really want to do ,COMMA and make a buck and live with this job .PERIOD <BREAK>
No stories around the campfire .PERIOD <BREAK>
Difficult ,COMMA eh ?QUESTIONMARK It's meaningless .PERIOD <BREAK>
I think that the key to a healthy society is a thriving community of storytellers ,COMMA and I think that the Nigerian filmmakers really have proved this .PERIOD <BREAK>
It’s not an added sequence ,COMMA just some voices from Nollywood .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we know that there are more .PERIOD <BREAK>
They can be rented for pennies .PERIOD <BREAK>
You can be in a Lagos traffic jam and you can buy a movie or some bananas or some water .PERIOD Yes .PERIOD <BREAK>
In fact ,COMMA it appeared in a porno comic book ,COMMA which is the slide on the right .PERIOD <BREAK>
On the left-hand side ,COMMA I had the context of those little houses ,COMMA and I tried to build a building that fit into that context .PERIOD <BREAK>
And then I did a law school for Loyola in downtown LA .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it was my theory ,COMMA or my point of view ,COMMA that one didn't upstage the neighborhood -- one made accommodations .PERIOD <BREAK>
I mean ,COMMA the story I tell is that I got mad at postmodernism -- at po-mo -- and said that fish were 500 million years earlier than man ,COMMA and if you're going to go back ,COMMA we might as well go back to the beginning .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so I started making these funny things .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the client said ,COMMA Why no fish ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
It was a dialog with the context again .PERIOD <BREAK>
Couldn't find it .PERIOD <BREAK>
So .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it's one of the nicest pieces I've ever made ,COMMA I think .PERIOD <BREAK>
For reasons we don't want to talk about ,COMMA it got delayed .PERIOD <BREAK>
I went around Toronto and found a bathtub like my grandmother's ,COMMA and I put the fish in .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we've started to work on things .PERIOD <BREAK>
The highlight of the performance was at the end .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so I did a lot of dirty things with chain link ,COMMA which nobody will forgive me for .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's in perspective and everything .PERIOD <BREAK>
But we were trying to collide our ideas ,COMMA to put objects next to each other .PERIOD <BREAK>
Like a Morandi -- like the little bottles -- composing them like a still life .PERIOD <BREAK>
And he pushed that .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it was this interaction between that kind of ,COMMA up-the-ante stuff that became pretty interesting .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I still think the Time magazine picture will be of the binoculars ,COMMA you know ,COMMA leaving out the -- what the hell .PERIOD <BREAK>
I said ,COMMA If I can't get the craft that I want ,COMMA I'll use the craft I can get .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it was all of one material ,COMMA and the metal could go on the roof as well as the walls .PERIOD <BREAK>
I was given an opportunity to design an exhibit for the metalworkers' unions of America and Canada in Washington ,COMMA and I did it on the condition that they become my partners in the future and help me with all future metal buildings ,COMMA etc .PERIOD etc .PERIOD <BREAK>
And then more metal and some chain link in Santa Monica -- a little shopping center .PERIOD <BREAK>
It gave me an opportunity to make a sculpture out of it .PERIOD <BREAK>
When you have to do something really cheaply ,COMMA it's hard to get perfect corners and stuff .PERIOD <BREAK>
He didn't recommend me ,COMMA by the way .PERIOD <BREAK>
I keep trying to make it work .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's never been finished .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is the city hall over here somewhere ,COMMA and the courthouse .PERIOD <BREAK>
Sohio is on the axis here ,COMMA and we followed the axis ,COMMA and they're two kind of goalposts .PERIOD <BREAK>
And all this stuff at the bottom is a museum ,COMMA and an idea for a very fancy automobile entry .PERIOD <BREAK>
And following that basic idea of the village ,COMMA we changed it as we got into it .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's the living room .PERIOD <BREAK>
You come down from this level along the stairway ,COMMA and you enter the bedroom here ,COMMA going into the lake .PERIOD <BREAK>
These Stonehenge things were designed to give foreground and to create a greater depth in this shallow lot .PERIOD <BREAK>
I was trying to get around this plan coupe -- how do you do it ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Jay Chiat is a glutton for punishment ,COMMA and he hired me to do a house for him in the Hamptons .PERIOD <BREAK>
And then this is a kind of a shopping mall ,COMMA with a rodeo and restaurants .PERIOD <BREAK>
It has a chamber hall .PERIOD <BREAK>
There's commercial at the ground floor .PERIOD <BREAK>
The acoustician in the competition gave us criteria ,COMMA which led to this compartmentalized scheme ,COMMA which we found out after the competition would not work at all .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the Ritz-Carlton Tower is being designed with exposed steel ,COMMA non-fire proof ,COMMA much like those old gas tanks .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the food wasn't as good as the stuff ,COMMA and so it failed .PERIOD <BREAK>
Thank you very much .PERIOD <BREAK>
I know Bill Joy was talking to you about the wonders of carbon nanotubes ,COMMA so I'm going to talk to you about the wonders of carbon macro-tubes ,COMMA which is charcoal .PERIOD <BREAK>
What we wanted to do was we wanted to find a way to harness this waste resource and turn it into a fuel that would be something that people could easily cook with ,COMMA something like charcoal .PERIOD <BREAK>
After some time ,COMMA after setting it on fire ,COMMA you seal it to restrict the oxygen that goes into the kiln ,COMMA and then you end up with this carbonized material here .PERIOD <BREAK>
However ,COMMA you can't burn this .PERIOD It's too fine and it burns too quickly to be useful for cooking .PERIOD <BREAK>
So we had to try to find a way to form it into useful briquettes .PERIOD <BREAK>
Compared to the sugarcane charcoal ,COMMA where we actually have to teach people how to form it into briquettes and you have the extra step of cooking the binder ,COMMA this comes pre-briquetted .PERIOD <BREAK>
But this is one of the incredibly rare situations where you also have economic benefits .PERIOD <BREAK>
They can generate income from this .PERIOD <BREAK>
They can save the money that they were going to spend on charcoal ,COMMA and they can produce excess and sell it in the market to people who aren't making their own .PERIOD <BREAK>
I mean the world where advanced building materials means cement roofing tiles that are made by hand ,COMMA and where ,COMMA when you work 10 hours a day ,COMMA you're still only earning 60 dollars in a month .PERIOD <BREAK>
And more than half of you would be living on less than a dollar a day .PERIOD <BREAK>
Do you need to find entrepreneurs ,COMMA or venture capitalists ,COMMA or what do you need to take what you've got and get it to scale ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
These are some of my kids with a salad bar .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the very first thing was about regional food -- trying to eat food from within our region .PERIOD <BREAK>
We can't keep feeding our kids pesticides and herbicides and antibiotics and hormones .PERIOD <BREAK>
The USDA allows these antibiotics ,COMMA these hormones and these pesticides in our food supply ,COMMA and the USDA paid for this ad in Time magazine .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's no wonder ,COMMA you know ,COMMA we have criminals .PERIOD <BREAK>
What goes in is what we are .PERIOD <BREAK>
The CDC ,COMMA the Center for Disease Control ,COMMA has said ,COMMA of the children born in the year 2000 -- those seven- and eight-year-olds today -- one out of every three Caucasians ,COMMA one out of every two African-Americans and Hispanics are going to have diabetes in their lifetime .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it's because of what we feed them .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is the USDA portion size ,COMMA that little ,COMMA tiny thing .PERIOD <BREAK>
In case you can't tell ,COMMA that's ,COMMA like ,COMMA pink Danish and some kind of cupcakes .PERIOD <BREAK>
In fact ,COMMA this may be what a lot of parents serve ,COMMA as opposed to -- this is what we try and serve .PERIOD <BREAK>
There's not a strawberry tree or a carrot bush .PERIOD <BREAK>
You're not going to get the next generation ,COMMA or the generation after ,COMMA to be able to think like this if they're not nourished .PERIOD <BREAK>
And these calendars really started to lay out my program .PERIOD <BREAK>
You know ,COMMA we have to change it .PERIOD <BREAK>
We have to teach kids that if they're on a diet of refined sugar ,COMMA they go up and down ,COMMA just like if they're on a diet of crack .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we have to pull it all together .PERIOD We have composting in all of our schools .PERIOD <BREAK>
Because ,COMMA you know what ,COMMA many of us are sort of at the end of our careers ,COMMA and we need to be giving these kids -- these young kids ,COMMA the next generation -- the tools to save themselves and save the planet .PERIOD <BREAK>
I had 90 employees .PERIOD <BREAK>
In this country ,COMMA we're spending 110 billion dollars a year on fast food .PERIOD <BREAK>
That 8 billion comes down to two dollars and 49 cents -- that's what the government allocates for lunch .PERIOD <BREAK>
And those are the same kids who are going to be getting sick .PERIOD <BREAK>
Look how odd he looks with the eyebrows missing .PERIOD <BREAK>
Max has kindly donated his photograph to me .PERIOD <BREAK>
Our research has shown that the parents and close loved ones of these children adore them .PERIOD <BREAK>
We crave the approval of our peers .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'd like you all in the audience now to push your lower jaw forward .PERIOD <BREAK>
People know now that I'm enthusiastic ,COMMA that I'm a happy person .PERIOD <BREAK>
He maintained a calm insouciance .PERIOD <BREAK>
We can categorize it like that .PERIOD <BREAK>
Because you might say ,COMMA Well ,COMMA this type of surgery might be regarded as cosmetic .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'll move it off ,COMMA and we'll have a blank slide for those who are squeamish amongst you .PERIOD <BREAK>
And again ,COMMA as I told you ,COMMA if they have a caring family and good work life ,COMMA then they can lead normal and fulfilled lives .PERIOD <BREAK>
So it's not simply a Western phenomenon .PERIOD <BREAK>
We make judgments on people's faces all the time .PERIOD <BREAK>
Good-looking people are always judged as being more friendly .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is an image of Ann who's had her right jaw removed and the base of her skull removed .PERIOD <BREAK>
So it's very valuable to have that tool in our armamentarium .PERIOD <BREAK>
But the patients are going to have to take drugs that suppress their immune system for the rest of their lives .PERIOD <BREAK>
We're still not curing enough patients -- it's the most disfiguring cancer .PERIOD <BREAK>
We still can't get rid of scars .PERIOD <BREAK>
Whereas I felt that when you design ,COMMA you either improve or you create a detriment to the community in which you're designing in .PERIOD <BREAK>
Working within the United States ,COMMA most people look at poverty and they see the face of a foreigner ,COMMA but go live -- I live in Bozeman ,COMMA Montana -- go up to the north plains on the reservations ,COMMA or go down to Alabama or Mississippi pre-Katrina ,COMMA and I could have shown you places that have far worse conditions than many developing countries I've been to .PERIOD <BREAK>
So in the past seven years -- this isn't just about nonprofit .PERIOD <BREAK>
What it showed me is that there's a grassroots movement going on of socially responsible designers who really believe that this world has got a lot smaller ,COMMA and that we have the opportunity -- not the responsibility ,COMMA but the opportunity -- to really get involved in making change .PERIOD <BREAK>
So it's really important that if we're designing and trying to create change ,COMMA we build that change .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it wasn't doctors telling us this ;SEMICOLON it was actual villagers that we were staying with .PERIOD <BREAK>
We just don't know how to show this .PERIOD <BREAK>
And on the fourth week ,COMMA the doctors come and they mow out an area ,COMMA put a tensile structure on the top and when the doctors have finished treating and seeing patients and villagers ,COMMA you cut down the clinic and you eat it .PERIOD It's an Eat Your Own Clinic .PERIOD <BREAK>
And you have to keep the maintenance down .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so we decided to look at the idea of sports and create a youth sports center that doubled as an HIV/AIDS outreach center ,COMMA and the coaches of the girls' team were also trained doctors .PERIOD <BREAK>
So this is the designer .PERIOD He's out there working with the first ever women's soccer team in Kwa-Zulu Natal ,COMMA Siyathemba ,COMMA and they can tell it better .PERIOD <BREAK>
Video :COLON Well ,COMMA my name is Sisi ,COMMA because I work at the African center .PERIOD <BREAK>
This was a connection ,COMMA just a meeting with somebody who wanted to develop Africa's first telemedicine center ,COMMA in Tanzania .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is a 370 -dollar shelter that can be easily assembled .PERIOD <BREAK>
Designing housing .PERIOD This house is going to go in in a couple of weeks .PERIOD <BREAK>
We put together very quickly a washroom .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is Shandra and the Calhouns .PERIOD They're photographers who have documented the Lower Ninth for the last 40 years .PERIOD <BREAK>
One billion people live in abject poverty .PERIOD <BREAK>
If we do nothing about the housing crisis that's about to happen ,COMMA in 20 years ,COMMA one in three people will live in an unplanned settlement or a refugee camp .PERIOD Look left ,COMMA look right :COLON one of you will be there .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I want this whole thing to work multi-lingually .PERIOD <BREAK>
The idea of needs-based competitions -- X-Prize for the other 98 percent ,COMMA if you want to call it that .PERIOD <BREAK>
We also want to look at ways of matchmaking and putting funding partners together .PERIOD <BREAK>
There should be a sheet .PERIOD I don't have time to read this ,COMMA because I'm going to be yanked off .PERIOD <BREAK>
So I'm going to speak about a problem that I have and that's that I'm a philosopher .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I get hoots of derision and cackles and growls because they think ,COMMA That's impossible !EXCLAMATIONMARK You can't explain consciousness .PERIOD <BREAK>
My late ,COMMA lamented friend Bob Nozick ,COMMA a fine philosopher ,COMMA in one of his books ,COMMA Philosophical Explanations ,COMMA is commenting on the ethos of philosophy -- the way philosophers go about their business .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'm sure that people here who work on ,COMMA say ,COMMA climate change and global warming ,COMMA or on the future of the Internet ,COMMA encounter people who have very strong opinions about what's going to happen next .PERIOD <BREAK>
But with regard to consciousness ,COMMA people seem to think ,COMMA each of us seems to think ,COMMA I am an expert .PERIOD <BREAK>
No other ingredients at all .PERIOD We're just made of cells ,COMMA about 100 trillion of them .PERIOD <BREAK>
The content -- there's color ,COMMA there's ideas ,COMMA there's memories ,COMMA there's history .PERIOD And somehow all that content of consciousness is accomplished by the busy activity of those hoards of neurons .PERIOD <BREAK>
So this is the problem .PERIOD So I have to do a little bit of the sort of work that a lot of you won't like ,COMMA for the same reason that you don't like to see a magic trick explained to you .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's one that I predicted in the last page or two of my 1991 book ,COMMA Consciousness Explained ,COMMA where I said if you did experiments of this sort ,COMMA you'd find that people were unable to pick up really large changes .PERIOD <BREAK>
And as I walked towards the picture ,COMMA I was expecting detail that wasn't there .PERIOD <BREAK>
You're familiar with a more recent technology ,COMMA which is -- There ,COMMA you can get a better view of the blobs .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA what does your brain do when it takes the suggestion ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
I don't think so .PERIOD Not a chance .PERIOD But then ,COMMA how on Earth is it done ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
It's the same thing .PERIOD <BREAK>
The brain isn't actually putting the detail in your head at all .PERIOD <BREAK>
Is the shape on the left the same as the shape on the right ,COMMA rotated ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Yes .PERIOD <BREAK>
And if you read that literature ,COMMA one of the things that you really have to come to terms with is even when you're the subject in the experiment ,COMMA you don't know .PERIOD <BREAK>
Well ,COMMA that's where you have to go backstage and ask the magician .PERIOD <BREAK>
How many of you see that sort of boundary ,COMMA with the Necker cube floating in front of the circles ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Can you see it ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
When you see the cube one way ,COMMA behind the screen ,COMMA those boundaries go away .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I supposed that that was just a flat truth ,COMMA always true .PERIOD <BREAK>
Let me just pause this for a second if I can .PERIOD <BREAK>
So now we're going to be subjects in the experiment .PERIOD <BREAK>
Audience :COLON Yes .PERIOD <BREAK>
So 155 seconds is the median time for subjects in his experiment there .PERIOD <BREAK>
How many still don't see it ?QUESTIONMARK How many still don't see it ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Thank you very much .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I ever met more humble people .PERIOD <BREAK>
The mosque where the respectful foreigner is showered with blessings and with tears ,COMMA and welcomed as a gift .PERIOD <BREAK>
What do we know about the women 10 years after the war ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Well ,COMMA the thesis of The Bottom Billion is that a billion people have been stuck living in economies that have been stagnant for 40 years ,COMMA and hence diverging from the rest of mankind .PERIOD <BREAK>
The last time the rich world got serious about developing another region was in the late 1940 s .PERIOD <BREAK>
Yes ,COMMA you tear up the Eleventh Commandment -- national sovereignty .PERIOD <BREAK>
We need to be at least as serious as we were then .PERIOD <BREAK>
The commodity booms are pumping unprecedented amounts of money into many ,COMMA though not all ,COMMA of the countries of the bottom billion .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA a mass of new discoveries .PERIOD <BREAK>
Just to give you one example :COLON Angola alone is getting 50 billion dollars a year in oil revenue .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA here comes a bit of science ,COMMA and this is a bit of science I've done since The Bottom Billion ,COMMA so it's new .PERIOD <BREAK>
Come back 15 years later .PERIOD <BREAK>
You know how rights to resource extraction are being sold at the moment ,COMMA how they've been sold over the last 40 years ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
A company flies in ,COMMA does a deal with a minister .PERIOD <BREAK>
Thank you .PERIOD <BREAK>
I was an unlikely person to be doing this .PERIOD <BREAK>
I never studied sculpture ,COMMA engineering or architecture .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's a self-portrait titled Wide Hips .PERIOD <BREAK>
Returning to India to work with those fishermen ,COMMA we made a net of a million and a half hand-tied knots -- installed briefly in Madrid .PERIOD <BREAK>
My life was not going to be the same .PERIOD <BREAK>
Next challenge ,COMMA the Biennial of the Americas in Denver asked ,COMMA could I represent the 35 nations of the Western hemisphere and their interconnectedness in a sculpture ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
I read about the recent earthquake in Chile and the tsunami that rippled across the entire Pacific Ocean .PERIOD <BREAK>
I started my journey 30 years ago .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that also brought me to the fact that this poses such a risk to our society .PERIOD <BREAK>
And together they only form about 15 years of supply .PERIOD <BREAK>
But now ,COMMA we have a real technology to do this .PERIOD <BREAK>
When they control their brain ,COMMA they can control their pain .PERIOD <BREAK>
When you do ,COMMA what do you want to control ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
You will be able to look at all the aspects that make you yourself ,COMMA all your experiences .PERIOD <BREAK>
These are some of the areas we're working on today that I don't have time to go into in detail .PERIOD <BREAK>
But I want to leave with you the big question .PERIOD <BREAK>
We are the first generation that's going to be able to enter into ,COMMA using this technology ,COMMA the human mind and brain .PERIOD <BREAK>
What is worth dying for ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
We know that it's possible to live in a failed state ,COMMA where everything that can go wrong does go wrong -- where mothers cannot feed their children ,COMMA where strangers cannot find the basis for peaceful collaboration ,COMMA where people are murdered indiscriminately .PERIOD <BREAK>
For instance ,COMMA there are 21 states in our country where corporal punishment in the classroom is legal ,COMMA where it is legal for a teacher to beat a child with a wooden board ,COMMA hard ,COMMA and raising large bruises and blisters and even breaking the skin .PERIOD <BREAK>
But we can ask the obvious question :COLON Is it a good idea ,COMMA generally speaking ,COMMA to subject children to pain and violence and public humiliation as a way of encouraging healthy emotional development and good behavior ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA many of you might worry that the notion of well-being is truly undefined ,COMMA and seemingly perpetually open to be re-construed .PERIOD <BREAK>
When this statue was carved the average life expectancy was probably 30 .PERIOD <BREAK>
does not tempt us to say that there are no truths to be known about human nutrition .PERIOD <BREAK>
Many people worry that a universal morality would require moral precepts that admit of no exceptions .PERIOD <BREAK>
And yet ,COMMA chess is a domain of perfect objectivity .PERIOD <BREAK>
But what does voluntary mean in a community where ,COMMA when a girl gets raped ,COMMA her father's first impulse ,COMMA rather often ,COMMA is to murder her out of shame ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Just let that fact detonate in your brain for a minute :COLON Your daughter gets raped ,COMMA and what you want to do is kill her .PERIOD <BREAK>
But if we are in a reflective mood ,COMMA we can ask ,COMMA Is this the perfect expression of psychological balance with respect to variables like youth and beauty and women's bodies ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Whenever we are talking about facts certain opinions must be excluded .PERIOD <BREAK>
Paint your picture of what rolling the clock 50 years forward ,COMMA 100 years forward ,COMMA how you would like to think of the world ,COMMA balancing moral progress with richness .PERIOD <BREAK>
But again ,COMMA then we have to talk about well-being in a larger context .PERIOD <BREAK>
Sam ,COMMA this is a conversation I would actually love to continue for hours .PERIOD <BREAK>
We don't have that ,COMMA but maybe another time .PERIOD Thank you for coming to TED .PERIOD <BREAK>
And then ,COMMA within zoology ,COMMA I took the course or the discipline of entomology ,COMMA the science of insects .PERIOD <BREAK>
Because biological control phenomenon ,COMMA you can see it in your backyard .PERIOD <BREAK>
So this phenomenon of natural control exists literally everywhere .PERIOD <BREAK>
So it's everywhere ,COMMA and we need to know how to exploit it .PERIOD <BREAK>
What damage [does] it actually inflict on the plant ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Insects ,COMMA those six-legged organisms and spiders or mites ,COMMA the eight-legged organisms .PERIOD <BREAK>
On your right-hand side you can see a cucumber leaf ,COMMA and on the middle ,COMMA cotton leaf ,COMMA and on the left a tomato leaf with these little stipplings .PERIOD <BREAK>
By the way ,COMMA it's springtime now in Israel .PERIOD <BREAK>
When temperature rises sharply ,COMMA you can see those bad ones ,COMMA those aphids ,COMMA all over the plants ,COMMA in your hibiscus ,COMMA in your lantana ,COMMA in the young ,COMMA fresh foliage of the spring flush ,COMMA so-called .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is all natural .PERIOD This is all natural .PERIOD <BREAK>
Again ,COMMA we'll start first with the pest :COLON the thrips .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is a sweet pepper which is not consumable because it is suffering from a viral disease transmitted by those thrip adults .PERIOD <BREAK>
Many different parts .PERIOD <BREAK>
By the way ,COMMA they have a very nice landscape -- you see the Jordanian Mountains on the one hand and the Jordan Valley on the other hand ,COMMA and a good ,COMMA mild winter and a nice ,COMMA hot summer ,COMMA which is an excellent condition to mass-produce those creatures .PERIOD <BREAK>
Here we come with those natural enemies in order to reverse a little bit of the wheel and to bring more natural balance to the agricultural plot by reducing those chemicals .PERIOD <BREAK>
In this table ,COMMA you can actually see what is an impact of a successful biological control by good bugs .PERIOD <BREAK>
But if we go ,COMMA for example ,COMMA to this place ,COMMA Southeast Israel ,COMMA the Arava area above the Great Rift Valley ,COMMA where the really top-notch -- the pearl of the Israeli agriculture is located ,COMMA especially under greenhouse conditions ,COMMA or under screenhouse conditions -- if you drive all the way to Eilat ,COMMA you see this just in the middle of the desert .PERIOD <BREAK>
Step by step ,COMMA it does narrow .PERIOD <BREAK>
So I'm saying it on behalf of all the biocontrol petitioners and implementers ,COMMA in Israel and abroad ,COMMA really give nature a chance .PERIOD <BREAK>
How can we understand what makes some societies more fragile than other societies ?QUESTIONMARK The problem is obviously relevant to our situation today ,COMMA because today as well ,COMMA there are some societies that have already collapsed ,COMMA such as Somalia and Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia .PERIOD There are also societies today that may be close to collapse ,COMMA such as Nepal ,COMMA Indonesia and Columbia .PERIOD <BREAK>
What is there that we can learn from the past that would help us avoid declining or collapsing in the way that so many past societies have ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Why did they all end up dead ?QUESTIONMARK Well ,COMMA in my five-point framework ,COMMA the first item on the framework is to look for human impacts on the environment :COLON people inadvertently destroying the resource base on which they depend .PERIOD And in the case of the Viking Norse ,COMMA the Vikings inadvertently caused soil erosion and deforestation ,COMMA which was a particular problem for them because they required forests to make charcoal ,COMMA to make iron .PERIOD <BREAK>
Or again ,COMMA the collapse of the Soviet Union took place within a couple of decades ,COMMA maybe within a decade ,COMMA of the time when the Soviet Union was at its greatest power .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA this is a frequent theme :COLON societies collapse very soon after reaching their peak in power .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I would expect that ,COMMA if our human civilization carries on ,COMMA then maybe in the next century people will be asking ,COMMA why on earth did these people today in the year 2003 not see the obvious things that they were doing and take corrective action ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
One blueprint for trouble ,COMMA making collapse likely ,COMMA is where there is a conflict of interest between the short-term interest of the decision-making elites and the long-term interest of the society as a whole ,COMMA especially if the elites are able to insulate themselves from the consequences of their actions .PERIOD Where what's good in the short run for the elite is bad for the society as a whole ,COMMA there's a real risk of the elite doing things that would bring the society down in the long run .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA that's one general conclusion about why societies make bad decisions :COLON conflicts of interest .PERIOD <BREAK>
Instead ,COMMA all the major threats facing us today are problems entirely of our own making .PERIOD And since we made the problems ,COMMA we can also solve the problems .PERIOD That then means that it's entirely in our power to deal with these problems .PERIOD <BREAK>
So I think I'm actually the first one here -- I lead .PERIOD <BREAK>
And meanwhile ,COMMA I use nonsense ,COMMA as you can see .PERIOD <BREAK>
This was one of a series called Zany Afternoons ,COMMA which became a book .PERIOD <BREAK>
But the zeppelin was the biggest thing that ever moved made by man .PERIOD <BREAK>
There's Moscow ,COMMA Shirley .PERIOD Hope they speak Esperanto !EXCLAMATIONMARK <BREAK>
Those ,COMMA for example ,COMMA are Mark IV British tanks from 1916 .PERIOD <BREAK>
Happy little story ,COMMA isn't it ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Anybody who was anybody had an apartment there .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's obviously modeled on the Titanic .PERIOD <BREAK>
I thought I could jazz it up a bit ,COMMA have a little fun with it .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is the word side of my brain .PERIOD <BREAK>
And then when it ran ,COMMA a lovely lady ,COMMA an old lady named Mrs .PERIOD Edgar Rosenberg -- if you know that name -- called me and said she loved the cover ,COMMA it was so sweet .PERIOD <BREAK>
Pretty elegant .PERIOD Nothing like a crash to end a joke .PERIOD That completes my oeuvre .PERIOD <BREAK>
Okay ,COMMA I'm going to show you again something about our diets .PERIOD <BREAK>
There's six million species of insects on this planet ,COMMA six million species .PERIOD <BREAK>
There was an estimation ,COMMA a conservative estimation ,COMMA a couple of years ago that the US .PERIOD economy benefited by 57 billion dollars per year .PERIOD <BREAK>
Small animals eat insects .PERIOD <BREAK>
And here you see me enjoying a meal with caterpillars ,COMMA locusts ,COMMA bee pupae -- delicacies .PERIOD <BREAK>
You're eating at least 500 grams per year .PERIOD <BREAK>
We're even doing this on purpose .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now the situation in the world is going to change for you and me ,COMMA for everyone on this Earth .PERIOD <BREAK>
There was an FAO conference last October that was completely devoted to this .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we eat quite a lot of it .PERIOD <BREAK>
In the developing world it's much lower .PERIOD <BREAK>
So if you would be an entrepreneur ,COMMA what would you do ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
I gave you at least four arguments in favor .PERIOD <BREAK>
There are entrepreneurs in the Netherlands that produce them ,COMMA and one of them is here in the audience ,COMMA Marian Peeters ,COMMA who's in the picture .PERIOD <BREAK>
Well in the Netherlands ,COMMA we have an innovative Minister of Agriculture ,COMMA and she puts the insects on the menu in her restaurant in her ministry .PERIOD <BREAK>
Reset the three minutes ,COMMA that's just not fair .PERIOD <BREAK>
I would still be on my bad hip .PERIOD That was so disappointing .PERIOD <BREAK>
Great !EXCLAMATIONMARK Excellent !EXCLAMATIONMARK <BREAK>
So no ,COMMA suddenly I wasn't averse to butting any geezer off the list .PERIOD <BREAK>
They were desperate for volunteers because the average age of the volunteer at the hospital gift shop was 75 .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA next thing you know ,COMMA I had my bright blue volunteer vest ,COMMA I had my photo ID ,COMMA and I was fully trained by my 89 -year-old boss .PERIOD <BREAK>
I draped them casually over the chair in the doctor's office .PERIOD <BREAK>
But ,COMMA I'd like to ask you ,COMMA how would you tell the time if you didn't have an iPhone ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
You know ,COMMA I've always wanted one of these .PERIOD <BREAK>
And this one ,COMMA this is a replica from a 15 th-century device .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA tonight ,COMMA if it's clear you'll be able to see the summer triangle .PERIOD <BREAK>
Step three is identify the star on the front of the device .PERIOD <BREAK>
He would know what time the sun would rise ,COMMA and what time it would set .PERIOD <BREAK>
Probably not one made of brass .PERIOD He would have one made out of wood ,COMMA or paper .PERIOD And the vast majority of this first computer was a portable device that you could keep in the back of your pocket .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA what does the astrolabe inspire ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And what we gain with a new technology ,COMMA of course ,COMMA is precision and accuracy .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'm just going to show you how the robot works .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA even though there is nothing in nature that looks like this ,COMMA really ,COMMA we were inspired by biology and applying the principles of walking to this robot .PERIOD Thus it's a biologically inspired robot .PERIOD <BREAK>
We want to fold up the legs and shoot it up for long-range motion .PERIOD <BREAK>
We developed our adaptive gait planner .PERIOD <BREAK>
Welcome to RoMeLa ,COMMA the Robotics Mechanisms Laboratory at Virginia Tech .PERIOD <BREAK>
This robot is an amoeba robot .PERIOD <BREAK>
Robotic Air Powered Hand with Elastic Ligaments .PERIOD <BREAK>
We wanted to go tackle this problem in a very different direction .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA for example in Iraq ,COMMA you know ,COMMA the war zone ,COMMA there is roadside bombs .PERIOD Currently you send these remotely controlled vehicles that are armed .PERIOD <BREAK>
We actually have a fan club for the robot ,COMMA DARwIn :COLON Dynamic Anthropomorphic Robot with Intelligence .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA based on that success ,COMMA the following year we did the proper mechanical design starting from kinematics .PERIOD <BREAK>
And thus ,COMMA DARwIn I was born in 2005 .PERIOD <BREAK>
Dennis Hong :COLON So ,COMMA there is actually a competition called RoboCup .PERIOD <BREAK>
We were the very first team in the United States that qualified in the humanoid RoboCup competition .PERIOD <BREAK>
We truly believe this is going to be the very first running humanoid robot in the United States .PERIOD So ,COMMA stay tuned .PERIOD <BREAK>
How do we develop these kinds of ideas ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
We have a fully autonomous vehicle that can drive into urban environments .PERIOD We won a half a million dollars in the DARPA Urban Challenge .PERIOD <BREAK>
We also have the world's very first vehicle that can be driven by the blind .PERIOD <BREAK>
He gave a talk about how education and school kills creativity .PERIOD <BREAK>
For us roboticists ,COMMA engineers and scientists ,COMMA these tools ,COMMA these are the courses and classes you take in class .PERIOD <BREAK>
These are all the tools that we need .PERIOD <BREAK>
Bertie County is kind of a prime example in the demise of rural America .PERIOD <BREAK>
There are more buildings that are empty or in disrepair than occupied and in use .PERIOD <BREAK>
He was brought in in October 2007 as the new superintendent to basically fix this broken school system .PERIOD <BREAK>
So in February of 2009 ,COMMA Dr .PERIOD Zullinger invited us ,COMMA Project H Design -- which is a non-profit design firm that I founded -- to come to Bertie and to partner with him on the repair of this school district and to bring a design perspective to the repair of the school district .PERIOD <BREAK>
We now call this place home .PERIOD <BREAK>
But beyond our personal reasons for wanting to be there ,COMMA there is a huge need .PERIOD <BREAK>
It allows elementary-level students to learn core subjects through game play and activity and running around and screaming and being a kid .PERIOD <BREAK>
So the first batch of computers are being installed later this summer ,COMMA and we're helping Dr .PERIOD Zullinger develop some strategies around how we might connect the classroom and the home to extend learning beyond the school day .PERIOD <BREAK>
So we thought ,COMMA what if you could bring back shop class ,COMMA but this time orient the projects around things that the community needed ,COMMA and to infuse shop class with a more critical and creative-design-thinking studio process .PERIOD <BREAK>
So over the course of two semesters ,COMMA the Fall and the Spring ,COMMA the students spend three hours a day every single day in our 4500 square foot studio/shop space .PERIOD <BREAK>
So what Studio H might offer her is a way to develop skills so that she might give back in the most meaningful way .PERIOD <BREAK>
So for him ,COMMA Studio H offers him a way to develop the skills he will need as an architect ,COMMA everything from drafting to wood and metal construction to how to do research for a client .PERIOD <BREAK>
And going out into the community and interviewing your neighbors about what kind of food they buy and from where and why -- that's a homework assignment .PERIOD <BREAK>
Because ,COMMA when you zoom out that far ,COMMA you lose the ability to view people as humans .PERIOD <BREAK>
If you are a blind child in India ,COMMA you will very likely have to contend with at least two big pieces of bad news .PERIOD <BREAK>
So I felt that I needed to do two things .PERIOD <BREAK>
Here's the eye with the opaque lens ,COMMA the opaque lens extracted and an acrylic lens inserted .PERIOD <BREAK>
In fact ,COMMA the story holds true even if you have a person who got sight after several years of deprivation .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA the way we study that is ,COMMA let's say we find a child who has light sensitivity .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we've used this general approach to study many different visual proficiencies ,COMMA but I want to highlight one particular one ,COMMA and that is image parsing into objects .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA any image of the kind that you see on the left ,COMMA be it a real image or a synthetic image ,COMMA it's made up of little regions that you see in the middle column ,COMMA regions of different colors ,COMMA different luminances .PERIOD <BREAK>
And nobody knows how this integration happens ,COMMA and that's the question we asked with Project Prakash .PERIOD <BREAK>
Doctor :COLON What are their shapes ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Doctor :COLON Now ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
So we are creating Dylan ,COMMA which is a computational system with an ambitious goal of taking in visual inputs of the same kind that a human child would receive ,COMMA and autonomously discovering :COLON What are the objects in this visual input ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Here's what a baby-cam video looks like .PERIOD <BREAK>
What's amazing is that working with such highly degraded input ,COMMA the baby ,COMMA very quickly ,COMMA is able to discover meaning in such input .PERIOD <BREAK>
Even before the ball gets to a place ,COMMA the child is already looking there .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA to summarize :COLON Prakash ,COMMA in its five years of existence ,COMMA it's had an impact in multiple areas ,COMMA ranging from basic neuroscience plasticity and learning in the brain ,COMMA to clinically relevant hypotheses like in autism ,COMMA the development of autonomous machine vision systems ,COMMA education of the undergraduate and graduate students ,COMMA and most importantly in the alleviation of childhood blindness .PERIOD <BREAK>
You know ,COMMA he's thinking ,COMMA What am I getting myself into ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And he said ,COMMA No ,COMMA no ,COMMA really .PERIOD You can .PERIOD <BREAK>
And no disabled person had ever done that -- run at a collegiate level .PERIOD <BREAK>
It was really ,COMMA really hot .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it's the first -- I had just gotten these new sprinting legs that you see in that bio ,COMMA and I didn't realize at that time that the amount of sweating I would be doing in the sock -- it actually acted like a lubricant and I'd be ,COMMA kind of ,COMMA pistoning in the socket .PERIOD <BREAK>
He kept me on the right track .PERIOD <BREAK>
Everyone was taking pictures -- What is this girl running on ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
I'm sitting there ,COMMA like ,COMMA Oh ,COMMA my god .PERIOD Oh ,COMMA my god .PERIOD <BREAK>
So they call us out and ,COMMA you know -- Ladies ,COMMA you have one minute .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I had to think ,COMMA Why did I do this ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
You know ,COMMA show us more than one set of legs .PERIOD <BREAK>
No ,COMMA these are my cosmetic legs ,COMMA actually ,COMMA and they're absolutely beautiful .PERIOD <BREAK>
It has a shock absorber in it so it ,COMMA like ,COMMA Shhhh ,COMMA makes this neat sound when you jump around on it .PERIOD All right .PERIOD <BREAK>
In these .PERIOD <BREAK>
For me ,COMMA while I'm such a serious athlete on the track ,COMMA I want to be feminine off the track ,COMMA and I think it's so important not to be limited in any capacity ,COMMA whether it's ,COMMA you know ,COMMA your mobility or even fashion .PERIOD <BREAK>
I mean ,COMMA I love the fact that I can go in anywhere and pick out what I want -- the shoes I want ,COMMA the skirts I want -- and I'm hoping to try to bring these over here and make them accessible to a lot of people .PERIOD <BREAK>
Two weeks ago ,COMMA Aimee was up for the Arthur Ashe award at the ESPYs .PERIOD <BREAK>
They didn't even want to touch that one .PERIOD They just did it .PERIOD <BREAK>
What we're looking at here is the insidious cost of ringtone piracy .PERIOD <BREAK>
But now you can find out all about -- unfortunately ,COMMA my weight is a little higher than that ,COMMA but -- all about what happens .PERIOD <BREAK>
So I think in terms of the fact that math has been liberated from calculating .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's the chore .PERIOD <BREAK>
Computers allow us to do that -- and this is not a small problem by any means .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's an amazing amount of human endeavor .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I'll say ,COMMA Hmm ,COMMA not sure .PERIOD I'll think about it roughly .PERIOD <BREAK>
Well one of them is ,COMMA they say ,COMMA you need to get the basics first .PERIOD <BREAK>
That somehow ,COMMA if you use a computer ,COMMA it's all mindless button-pushing ,COMMA but if you do it by hand ,COMMA it's all intellectual .PERIOD <BREAK>
Might have been 50 years ago ,COMMA but it isn't anymore .PERIOD <BREAK>
Why are we using computers to show a student how to solve a problem by hand that the computer should be doing anyway ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Same principles applied -- calculations ,COMMA harder .PERIOD <BREAK>
So the problem we've really got in math education is not that computers might dumb it down ,COMMA but that we have dumbed-down problems right now .PERIOD <BREAK>
So if you go through lots of examples ,COMMA you can get the answer ,COMMA you can understand how the basics of the system work better .PERIOD <BREAK>
So programming is the way I think we should be doing that .PERIOD <BREAK>
This was an example I built for my daughter .PERIOD <BREAK>
You can see that this is a very early step into limits and differential calculus and what happens when you take things to an extreme -- and very small sides and a very large number of sides .PERIOD <BREAK>
And yet ,COMMA that's a really important practical view of the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's like the land and the king they're inseparable ,COMMA they are one .PERIOD <BREAK>
The contract is the same as with real word objects in real world containers .PERIOD <BREAK>
And finally ,COMMA to pull out all the stops ,COMMA this is a system called Urp ,COMMA for urban planners ,COMMA in which we give architects and urban planners back the models that we confiscated when we insisted that they use CAD systems .PERIOD <BREAK>
It projects down digital shadows ,COMMA as you see here .PERIOD <BREAK>
There are inter-shadowing studies that children can operate ,COMMA even though they don't know anything about urban planning :COLON To move a building ,COMMA you simply reach out your hand and you move the building .PERIOD <BREAK>
This work is 15 years old .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the great thing about it was that Alex was so dedicated to the idea of verisimilitude ,COMMA the idea that the putative 2054 that we were painting in the film be believable ,COMMA that he allowed us to take on that design work as if it were an R&ampD effort .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the result is sort of gratifyingly perpetual .PERIOD <BREAK>
People still reference those sequences in Minority Report when they talk about new UI design .PERIOD <BREAK>
These are logistics elements that are scattered across the United States .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is a system called TAMPER ,COMMA which is a slightly whimsical look at what the future of editing and media manipulation systems might be .PERIOD <BREAK>
We'll go over to Jacques Tati here and grab our blue friend and put him down on the table as well .PERIOD <BREAK>
Let me leave with one final thought ,COMMA and that is that one of the greatest English language writers of the last three decades suggested that great art is always a gift .PERIOD <BREAK>
Can it be for every man ,COMMA or is this just for corporations and movie producers ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
That's our goal entirely .PERIOD <BREAK>
So this is the inevitability about it .PERIOD <BREAK>
I just like to dive right in and become sort of a human guinea pig .PERIOD <BREAK>
It was a wonderful experience .PERIOD <BREAK>
You can just Google it .PERIOD <BREAK>
As I say in my book ,COMMA I'm Jewish in the same way the Olive Garden is Italian .PERIOD <BREAK>
The first thing I did was I got a stack of bibles .PERIOD <BREAK>
I had Christian bibles .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA I wanted to follow that rule .PERIOD <BREAK>
And there were two types of laws that were particularly challenging .PERIOD <BREAK>
But it's a big part of the Bible ,COMMA so I figured I had to address it .PERIOD <BREAK>
I wanted to see how dressing biblically affected my mind .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I explained my project ,COMMA and he said ,COMMA Well ,COMMA I am an adulterer ,COMMA are you going to stone me ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
They really did a fantastic job .PERIOD <BREAK>
I wanted it to be about religion in America .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA this was very inspiring to me .PERIOD <BREAK>
I recommend Jim Wallis and Tony Campolo .PERIOD <BREAK>
They're very inspiring leaders ,COMMA even though I disagree with much of what they say .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I would say ,COMMA But that's crazy .PERIOD <BREAK>
The key is to pick and choose the right parts .PERIOD <BREAK>
There's the phrase called cafeteria religion ,COMMA and the fundamentalists will use it in a denigrating way ,COMMA and they'll say ,COMMA Oh ,COMMA it's just cafeteria religion .PERIOD <BREAK>
You're just picking and choosing .PERIOD <BREAK>
The story starts in Kenya in December of 2007 ,COMMA when there was a disputed presidential election ,COMMA and in the immediate aftermath of that election ,COMMA there was an outbreak of ethnic violence .PERIOD <BREAK>
And she quickly said ,COMMA It's too much .PERIOD <BREAK>
And enough people looked at it and found it valuable enough that the programmers who created Ushahidi decided they were going to make it open source and turn it into a platform .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it represents the ability of the world's population to volunteer and to contribute and collaborate on large ,COMMA sometimes global ,COMMA projects .PERIOD <BREAK>
And once they've done it ,COMMA they can do it again ,COMMA and they could work on getting it better .PERIOD <BREAK>
Even with the sacred printing press ,COMMA we got erotic novels 150 years before we got scientific journals .PERIOD <BREAK>
So before I talk about what is ,COMMA I think ,COMMA the critical difference between LOLcats and Ushahidi ,COMMA I want to talk about their shared source .PERIOD <BREAK>
At pick-up time the teachers ,COMMA who have been with your children all day ,COMMA would like you to be there at the appointed hour to take your children back .PERIOD <BREAK>
Late pick-ups went up every week for the next four weeks until they topped out at triple the pre-fine average ,COMMA and then they fluctuated at between double and triple the pre-fine average for the life of the fine .PERIOD <BREAK>
They were operating with social constraints rather than contractual ones .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's value created by the participants but enjoyed by society as a whole .PERIOD <BREAK>
The goals set out by Ushahidi are not just to make life better for the participants ,COMMA but to make life better for everyone in the society in which Ushahidi is operating .PERIOD <BREAK>
We've got a choice before us .PERIOD <BREAK>
And may it run forever ,COMMA because it gives people like me a living .PERIOD <BREAK>
There were two Sundays in between .PERIOD But of course ,COMMA Sundays are church days ,COMMA so you don't play on Sundays .PERIOD And one day it rained ,COMMA so they all sat around making friends with each other .PERIOD <BREAK>
And then you worked out your strategy ,COMMA and you came and fought the next day ,COMMA and you went back home again .PERIOD <BREAK>
Take a look :COLON You could play it in the dump with some rocks over there ,COMMA you could play it in a little alley -- you couldn't hit square anywhere ,COMMA because the bat hit the wall ;SEMICOLON don't forget the air conditioning and the cable wires .PERIOD <BREAK>
As you can see ,COMMA you can play anywhere .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we won this World Cup in 1983 .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so we allowed multinationals into India .PERIOD <BREAK>
We cut customs duties ,COMMA we reduced import duties ,COMMA and we got all the multinationals coming in ,COMMA with multinational budgets ,COMMA who looked at per-capita income and got very excited about the possibilities in India ,COMMA and were looking for a vehicle to reach every Indian .PERIOD <BREAK>
But what a game we had ,COMMA M .PERIOD S .PERIOD Dhoni got it right in the air ,COMMA but Misbah-ul-Haq ,COMMA what a player .PERIOD <BREAK>
A massive ,COMMA massive success :COLON India ,COMMA the world TT champions .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA it was a different India .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA all of the sudden ,COMMA if you were to bowl a shot -- if Mumbai were to bowl a shot ,COMMA for example ,COMMA they needn't go to Kalbadevi or Shivaji Park or somewhere to source them ,COMMA they could go to Trinidad .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA he played in Hyderabad ,COMMA went ,COMMA straight after the game ,COMMA went from the stadium to Hyderabad airport ,COMMA sat in a private corporate jet -- first refueling in Portugal ,COMMA second refueling in Brazil ;SEMICOLON he was in West Indies in time .PERIOD <BREAK>
They started going to the cricket to watch Shah Rukh Khan .PERIOD <BREAK>
For a long time ,COMMA India was this country of poverty ,COMMA dust ,COMMA beggars ,COMMA snake charmers ,COMMA filth ,COMMA Delhi belly -- people heard Delhi belly stories before they came .PERIOD <BREAK>
Hopefully ,COMMA it'll make everyone richer ,COMMA hopefully it'll make the game bigger and hopefully it'll give cricket commentators more time in the business .PERIOD <BREAK>
We all make decisions every day ;SEMICOLON we want to know what the right thing is to do -- in domains from the financial to the gastronomic to the professional to the romantic .PERIOD <BREAK>
And surely ,COMMA if somebody could really tell us how to do exactly the right thing at all possible times ,COMMA that would be a tremendous gift .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is what statisticians technically call a damn fine bet .PERIOD <BREAK>
Calculating odds would seem to be something rather easy :COLON there are six sides to a die ,COMMA two sides to a coin ,COMMA 52 cards in a deck .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's because the mind recalls words by their first letter .PERIOD <BREAK>
Why in the world would anybody ever play the lottery ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Well ,COMMA there are many answers ,COMMA but one answer surely is ,COMMA we see a lot of winners .PERIOD Right ?QUESTIONMARK When this couple wins the lottery ,COMMA or Ed McMahon shows up at your door with this giant check -- how the hell do you cash things that size ,COMMA I don't know .PERIOD <BREAK>
When was the last time that you saw extensive interviews with everybody who lost ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
You can't say to yourself ,COMMA I'm as likely to win as anybody ,COMMA because you're not as likely to win as Leroy .PERIOD <BREAK>
Because they had the sense that declining wages are worse than rising wages ,COMMA even when the total amount of wages is higher in the declining period .PERIOD Here's another nice example .PERIOD <BREAK>
Here's a $ 2000 Hawaiian vacation package ;SEMICOLON it's now on sale for 1600 .PERIOD <BREAK>
This tendency to compare to the past is causing people to pass up the better deal .PERIOD In other words ,COMMA a good deal that used to be a great deal is not nearly as good as an awful deal that was once a horrible deal .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA just in case you're not getting it ,COMMA here's a schematic of what happened ,COMMA OK ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
The difference is that when you lost the ticket you say to yourself ,COMMA I'm not paying twice for the same thing .PERIOD <BREAK>
Nonetheless ,COMMA their predictions are perverted by a comparison that then does not carry through and change their experience .PERIOD <BREAK>
When you go to buy groceries with it ,COMMA it doesn't go ,COMMA I'm the money saved on the car stereo ,COMMA or ,COMMA I'm the dumb money saved on the car .PERIOD It's money .PERIOD <BREAK>
And if a drive across town is worth 100 bucks ,COMMA it's worth 100 bucks no matter what you're saving it on .PERIOD People don't think that way .PERIOD <BREAK>
Well ,COMMA by and large people are enormously impatient .PERIOD <BREAK>
Imagine that you can have 50 dollars in a year -- that's 12 months -- or 60 dollars in 13 months .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is just a graph showing the results that I just suggested you would show if I gave you time to respond ,COMMA which is ,COMMA people find that the subjective value of 50 is higher than the subjective value of 60 when they'll be delivered in now or one month ,COMMA respectively -- a 30 -day delay -- but they show the reverse pattern when you push the entire decision off into the future a year .PERIOD <BREAK>
What causes the bug ?QUESTIONMARK Is it the drama of the event -- that it's so spectacular ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
I don't want to say -- please ,COMMA I'm going to get quoted somewhere as saying ,COMMA Terrorism is fine and we shouldn't be so distressed .PERIOD <BREAK>
What I'm saying is that ,COMMA surely ,COMMA rationally ,COMMA our distress about things that happen ,COMMA about threats ,COMMA should be roughly proportional to the size of those threats and threats to come .PERIOD <BREAK>
There's no question .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so we evolved these responses .PERIOD <BREAK>
It turns out that the value of buying a lottery ticket is not winning .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's what you think it is .PERIOD All right ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And as a result ,COMMA many people look at economists as stupid people .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's the sequel to An Inconvenient Truth ,COMMA and it explores all the solutions that will solve the climate crisis .PERIOD <BREAK>
Or ,COMMA we can scroll through the pages at the bottom .PERIOD <BREAK>
Mike Matas :COLON And so throughout the whole book ,COMMA Al Gore will walk you through and explain the photos .PERIOD <BREAK>
This photo ,COMMA you can you can even see on an interactive map .PERIOD <BREAK>
And while it's playing ,COMMA we can pinch and peak back at the page ,COMMA and the movie keeps playing .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is very strange for me ,COMMA because I’m not used to doing this :COLON I usually stand on the other side of the light ,COMMA and now I'm feeling the pressure I put other people into .PERIOD And it's hard .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA we’ll go with the first piece .PERIOD <BREAK>
Court :COLON I don't want to get rid of you .PERIOD <BREAK>
Boy :COLON Look man ,COMMA reading don't feed no one .PERIOD <BREAK>
Boy :COLON Arguing with you is a waste of time ,COMMA Marcus .PERIOD <BREAK>
Marcus :COLON When a man resorts to profanities ,COMMA it’s a sure sign of his inability to express himself .PERIOD <BREAK>
Did you ever move your fuckin' ass from Hollywood to go and film something real ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
The first piece was ,COMMA really ,COMMA there's a young woman talking about Nigeria ,COMMA that she has a feeling she'll be happy there .PERIOD <BREAK>
So that whole thing ,COMMA that whole childhood echoes and takes me into the next piece .PERIOD <BREAK>
Commander :COLON Soldiers ,COMMA you are going to fight a battle ,COMMA so you must get ready and willing to die .PERIOD <BREAK>
C :COLON Success ,COMMA the change is only coming through the barrel of the gun .PERIOD <BREAK>
I don’t remember how we got there .PERIOD <BREAK>
The injection made us not to have mind .PERIOD <BREAK>
Various Voices :COLON You will die !EXCLAMATIONMARK You will die !EXCLAMATIONMARK <BREAK>
Onicha :COLON Ezra !EXCLAMATIONMARK <BREAK>
Why you giving these to me ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Mr .PERIOD Ezra Gelehun ,COMMA please stand .PERIOD <BREAK>
No ,COMMA we don’t .PERIOD <BREAK>
Mr .PERIOD Gelehun ,COMMA I'd like to remind you ,COMMA you're not on trial here today .PERIOD <BREAK>
You are not on trial .PERIOD <BREAK>
E :COLON So you are a liar .PERIOD <BREAK>
Thank you .PERIOD <BREAK>
In the process of my research ,COMMA I actually spent a bit of time in Sierra Leone researching this .PERIOD <BREAK>
I met psychosocial workers who worked with them .PERIOD <BREAK>
Frank Gehry :COLON I listened to this scientist this morning .PERIOD <BREAK>
I mean it is astonishing for an artist ,COMMA for an architect ,COMMA to become actually an icon and a legend in their own time .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I realized when I'd come into the meetings with these corrugated metal and chain link stuff ,COMMA and people would just look at me like I'd just landed from Mars .PERIOD <BREAK>
And like the playwright said the other day -- I could relate to him :COLON you're not sure .PERIOD <BREAK>
Yeah .PERIOD <BREAK>
There aren't many people around that are really involved with architecture as clients .PERIOD <BREAK>
If you think about the world ,COMMA and even just in this audience ,COMMA most of us are involved with buildings .PERIOD <BREAK>
I knew Craig and respected him .PERIOD <BREAK>
I knew you'd ask that question .PERIOD <BREAK>
I tried to understand that language as a beginning ,COMMA as a place to jump off ,COMMA and there was so much of it being done by spec builders and it was trivialized so much that it wasn't .PERIOD <BREAK>
Siza ,COMMA on the other hand ,COMMA continued in Portugal where the real stuff was and evolved a modern language that relates to that historic language .PERIOD <BREAK>
I tried to get him a couple of jobs and they didn't pan out .PERIOD <BREAK>
Where you .PERIOD It's like jazz :COLON you improvise ,COMMA you work together ,COMMA you play off each other ,COMMA you make something ,COMMA they make something .PERIOD <BREAK>
Richard Koshalek :COLON [Unclear] starts from 2004 .PERIOD <BREAK>
You can come to the opening .PERIOD I'll invite you .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'd seen drawings you had presented here at TED .PERIOD <BREAK>
They came for three days .PERIOD <BREAK>
You've all heard the Frank Lloyd Wright story ,COMMA when the woman called and said ,COMMA Mr .PERIOD Wright ,COMMA I'm sitting on the couch and the water's pouring in on my head .PERIOD <BREAK>
RSW :COLON Didn't get a laugh .PERIOD <BREAK>
What do you bring to it ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
That's what reminded me of it .PERIOD <BREAK>
Just before going to lunch with the mayor ,COMMA we went to the harbor commissioner .PERIOD <BREAK>
We sat down ,COMMA and we had a drink of water and everybody was quiet .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA I got up .PERIOD <BREAK>
They just brought us there to hustle this group ,COMMA you know ,COMMA to create a project .PERIOD <BREAK>
Because I want to get a standing ovation like everybody ,COMMA so .PERIOD <BREAK>
But ,COMMA reliable Dutchman -- -- Fantastic !EXCLAMATIONMARK <BREAK>
And this was the text -- In words as fashion the same rule will hold/ Alike fantastic if too new or old/ Be not the first by whom the new are tried/ Nor yet the last to lay the old aside .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA it was going nowhere .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's what happens .PERIOD <BREAK>
Silas usually has a better touch with his choice of quotations .PERIOD <BREAK>
Don't be trendy if you want to be serious .PERIOD <BREAK>
But ,COMMA we don't have time .PERIOD <BREAK>
There were 10 artists invited to participate in it ,COMMA and it was one of those things where it was extremely competitive and I didn't want to be embarrassed ,COMMA so I worked very hard on this .PERIOD <BREAK>
But I was absolutely stuck on the idea of art is and trying to determine what art was .PERIOD <BREAK>
We've watched the financial markets that we uniquely create -- these markets that were supposed to be foolproof -- we've watched them kind of collapse before our eyes .PERIOD <BREAK>
And of course ,COMMA if we are put in environments where we can't deal with it ,COMMA in some sense makes sense that we actually might mess certain things up .PERIOD <BREAK>
It feels like we might almost just be built to make errors in certain ways .PERIOD <BREAK>
So this is the question my students and I wanted to get at .PERIOD <BREAK>
What if we put Holly into the same context as humans ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Because ,COMMA you know ,COMMA it's great for us ,COMMA but bad for humans .PERIOD <BREAK>
They were these kind of weird things .PERIOD <BREAK>
So the monkeys get really good at this .PERIOD <BREAK>
The monkeys would rip-off the tokens at every available opportunity -- from each other ,COMMA often from us -- you know ,COMMA things we didn't necessarily think we were introducing ,COMMA but things we spontaneously saw .PERIOD <BREAK>
We were a little impatient so we wanted to sort of speed things up a bit .PERIOD <BREAK>
Sounds great ,COMMA but you get one more choice to earn a little bit more money .PERIOD <BREAK>
Your other option is a bit safe .PERIOD Your just going to get some money for sure .PERIOD <BREAK>
So see what your intuition is here .PERIOD <BREAK>
Most people say ,COMMA why should I be risky when I can get 1500 dollars for sure ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And now imagine that I have you make another choice But this time ,COMMA it's a little bit worse .PERIOD <BREAK>
They actually tend to go a little risky .PERIOD <BREAK>
And this means that sometimes we'll actually switch our preferences to avoid this .PERIOD <BREAK>
What you saw in that last scenario is that subjects get risky because they want the small shot that there won't be any loss .PERIOD <BREAK>
They're why stock investors hold onto losing stocks longer -- because they're evaluating them in relative terms .PERIOD <BREAK>
The question we were interested in is whether the monkeys show the same biases .PERIOD <BREAK>
Sometimes the monkeys get no bonus -- so this is a bonus of zero .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA the monkeys meet two guys who aren't giving them bonuses ;SEMICOLON they're actually giving them less than they expect .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA you know ,COMMA a little bad -- Sorry ,COMMA sorry ,COMMA sorry .PERIOD <BREAK>
When you're watching your stocks plummet into the red ,COMMA when you're watching your house price go down ,COMMA you're not going to be able to see that in anything but old evolutionary terms .PERIOD <BREAK>
But we have to recognize that we have those limitations .PERIOD <BREAK>
We have this Great North .PERIOD And there was a pretty small population ,COMMA and my father was an avid outdoorsman .PERIOD <BREAK>
But what I think it was telling me is that we are this transient thing that's happening ,COMMA and that the nature that you see out there -- the untouched shorelines ,COMMA the untouched forest that I was able to see -- really bring in a sense of that geological time ,COMMA that this has gone on for a long time ,COMMA and we're experiencing it in a different way .PERIOD <BREAK>
This rebirth of grass .PERIOD And then I went out for years trying to photograph the pristine landscape .PERIOD <BREAK>
So there's this thing that is pulling me in both directions .PERIOD <BREAK>
But we've become totally disconnected from them .PERIOD <BREAK>
That if we keep putting things ,COMMA through industrial and urban existence ,COMMA back into the system -- if we keep doing that -- we can continue on .PERIOD <BREAK>
Because I think everything that we're involved in -- our clothing ,COMMA our cars ,COMMA our roads ,COMMA and everything -- are directly a result .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'm going to move to some pictures of China .PERIOD <BREAK>
So this created a reservoir 600 kilometers long ,COMMA one of the largest reservoirs ever created .PERIOD <BREAK>
And again ,COMMA the rebuilding of the city -- to me ,COMMA it was sad to see that they didn't really grab a lot of ,COMMA I guess ,COMMA what we know here ,COMMA in terms of urban planning .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is a shot in one of the biggest squares in Guangdong -- and this is where a lot of migrant workers are coming in from the country .PERIOD <BREAK>
So this is a pink uniform at this factory .PERIOD It's a shoe factory .PERIOD <BREAK>
And they have dorms for the workers .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is one with 45000 ,COMMA so every lunch ,COMMA there's about 12000 coming through for lunch .PERIOD <BREAK>
They sit down ;SEMICOLON they have about 20 minutes .PERIOD <BREAK>
They're not getting enough ,COMMA so they're not going to move .PERIOD <BREAK>
Shanghai was a very intriguing city -- it's exploding on a level that I don't think any city has experienced .PERIOD <BREAK>
In fact ,COMMA even Shenzhen ,COMMA the economic zone -- one of the first ones -- 15 years ago was about 100000 people ,COMMA and today it boasts about 10 to 11 million .PERIOD <BREAK>
So this is three of the visible blast furnaces within that shot .PERIOD <BREAK>
I think one of the issues that we here are facing with China ,COMMA is that they're using a lot of the latest production technology .PERIOD <BREAK>
But that is the trick that they've got right now ,COMMA that they're winning with ,COMMA is that they're using all the latest technologies and extrusion machines ,COMMA and bringing all the components into play ,COMMA but the assembly is where they're actually bringing in -- the country workers are very willing to work .PERIOD They want to work .PERIOD <BREAK>
I had to have them freeze for 10 seconds to get this shot .PERIOD <BREAK>
There are 500 of these machines ;SEMICOLON they're worth about 200000 dollars each .PERIOD <BREAK>
So you have about 12 people running this ,COMMA and they're just inspecting it -- and they're just walking the lines .PERIOD <BREAK>
This was one of the biggest factories I've ever seen .PERIOD <BREAK>
But this is what happens to most of the computers .PERIOD <BREAK>
And as much as there are great things around the corner -- and it's palpable in this room -- of all of the things that are just about to break that can solve so many problems ,COMMA I'm really hoping that those things will spread around the world and will start to have a positive effect .PERIOD <BREAK>
Some of you might know ,COMMA he's a TEDster -- Stephen Sagmeister and I are working on some layouts .PERIOD And this is still in preliminary stages ;SEMICOLON these aren't the finals .PERIOD But these images ,COMMA with Worldchangingcom ,COMMA can be placed into any kind of media .PERIOD <BREAK>
So we're looking at this as trying to build out .PERIOD <BREAK>
And anything that you can do to promote that would be fantastic .PERIOD <BREAK>
That would be fantastic .PERIOD So those are my three wishes .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I'd like to start at the very beginning .PERIOD <BREAK>
The more stuff that's mine ,COMMA the better .PERIOD <BREAK>
And of course ,COMMA it's your stuff if it's broken .PERIOD <BREAK>
And they extract the metals by hand .PERIOD <BREAK>
So about 20 years ago ,COMMA I literally started in my garage tinkering around ,COMMA trying to figure out how to separate these very similar materials from each other ,COMMA and eventually enlisted a lot of my friends ,COMMA in the mining world actually ,COMMA and in the plastics world ,COMMA and we started going around to mining laboratories around the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
And instead of plopping down several hundred million dollars to build a chemical plant that will only make one type of plastic for its entire life ,COMMA our plants can make any type of plastic we feed them .PERIOD <BREAK>
We use a very highly automated process to sort those plastics ,COMMA not only by type ,COMMA but by grade .PERIOD <BREAK>
So I hope I've changed the way you look at at least some of the stuff in your life .PERIOD <BREAK>
Mother nature wastes very little ,COMMA reuses practically everything .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I hope that you stop looking at yourself as a consumer -- that's a label I've always hated my entire life -- and think of yourself as just using resources in one form ,COMMA until they can be transformed to another form for another use later in time .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA it was not always wonderful at that table .PERIOD <BREAK>
In fact ,COMMA you could come down to the tree to get your gifts and get ready to sing ,COMMA and then get ready for breakfast without even taking a bath or getting dressed ,COMMA except that daddy messed it up .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now that's compassion .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA let me tell you ,COMMA I kind of look at the world this way .PERIOD <BREAK>
I see -- always ,COMMA it stirs my heart -- a picture of Dr .PERIOD Martin Luther King ,COMMA Jr .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is the picture .PERIOD They said ,COMMA It's going to be too volatile for you to go .PERIOD <BREAK>
We are so connected that we must treat each other as if an action toward you is an action toward myself .PERIOD <BREAK>
And whatever else is needed ,COMMA I will provide it and pay for it when I return .PERIOD <BREAK>
This always seemed to me to be a deepening of the sense of what it means to be a Good Samaritan .PERIOD <BREAK>
But now ,COMMA to be a Good Samaritan -- and I always say ,COMMA and to be a good American -- for me ,COMMA is not simply to congratulate myself for the individual acts of care .PERIOD <BREAK>
And if mama eternal has taught us correctly ,COMMA this song will make sense ,COMMA not only to those of us who are a part of this gathering ,COMMA but to all who sign the charter for compassion .PERIOD <BREAK>
I just want to say my name is Emmanuel Jal .PERIOD <BREAK>
And also telling it like now .PERIOD <BREAK>
And also ,COMMA the easiest one was when I was doing it in form of a music .PERIOD <BREAK>
I wanted to revenge for my village .PERIOD <BREAK>
My every moment .PERIOD <BREAK>
Run ,COMMA duck ,COMMA play dead and hide .PERIOD <BREAK>
But still as I wonder ,COMMA I won't go under .PERIOD <BREAK>
I was ready to eat .PERIOD <BREAK>
Give us tools .PERIOD Give the farmers tools .PERIOD <BREAK>
And now we have a couple in university .PERIOD <BREAK>
♫ What would I be ?QUESTIONMARK ♫ ♫ If Emma never rescued me ?QUESTIONMARK ♫ ♫ What would I be ?QUESTIONMARK ♫ ♫ Another starving refugee ♫ ♫ What would I be ?QUESTIONMARK ♫ ♫ If Emma never rescued me ?QUESTIONMARK ♫ ♫ Yeah ,COMMA Yeah ♫ ♫ Yeah ,COMMA I would have probably died from starvation ♫ ♫ Or some other wretched disease ♫ ♫ I would have grown up with no education ♫ ♫ Just another refugee ♫ Thank you .PERIOD <BREAK>
We've used fear ,COMMA if you like ,COMMA to grab people's attention .PERIOD <BREAK>
A deer freezes very ,COMMA very still ,COMMA poised to run away .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I think that's what we're doing when we're asking people to engage with our agenda around environmental degradation and climate change .PERIOD <BREAK>
And unsurprisingly ,COMMA people all around the world say that what they want is happiness ,COMMA for themselves ,COMMA for their families ,COMMA their children ,COMMA their communities .PERIOD <BREAK>
Okay ,COMMA they think money is slightly important .PERIOD <BREAK>
It thinks in terms of how much bang do we get for our buck .PERIOD <BREAK>
They are doing that on a quarter of the resources that are used typically in [the] Western world -- a quarter of the resources .PERIOD <BREAK>
What's happening in Costa Rica ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
99 percent of their electricity comes from renewable resources .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so in strict happy-planet methodology ,COMMA we've become less efficient at turning our ultimate scarce resource into the outcome we want to .PERIOD <BREAK>
A child entering school today will be my age in 2050 .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I put it to you ,COMMA that is not business as usual .PERIOD <BREAK>
I think we want the lot of humanity to keep on increasing .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the point of these is they are ,COMMA not quite ,COMMA the secrets of happiness ,COMMA but they are things that I think happiness will flow out the side from .PERIOD <BREAK>
Keep building them .PERIOD <BREAK>
The second one is be active .PERIOD <BREAK>
Based on a lot of evidence for mindfulness ,COMMA cognitive behavioral therapy ,COMMA [very] strong for our well being .PERIOD <BREAK>
They don't need a lot of material goods to be satisfied .PERIOD <BREAK>
All that being good and no real credit for it .PERIOD <BREAK>
So I said ,COMMA Well ,COMMA Mom and Dad ,COMMA what about Santa Claus ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Santa would come to our house while we were at nine o'clock high mass on Christmas morning ,COMMA but only if all of us kids did not make a fuss .PERIOD <BREAK>
There's only one obvious conclusion to reach from this mountain of evidence :COLON our family was too strange and weird for even Santa Claus to come visit ,COMMA and my poor parents were trying to protect us from the embarrassment ,COMMA this humiliation of rejection by Santa ,COMMA who was jolly -- but ,COMMA let's face it ,COMMA he was also very judgmental .PERIOD <BREAK>
They had to fit two criteria :COLON they had to be old enough to be able to understand the whole concept of the age of reason ,COMMA and not yet seven .PERIOD <BREAK>
I just realized that the age of reason starts when you turn seven ,COMMA and then you're capable of committing any and all sins against God and man .PERIOD And Bill said ,COMMA So ?QUESTIONMARK And then I said ,COMMA So ,COMMA you're six .PERIOD You have a whole year to do anything you want to and God won't notice it .PERIOD And he said ,COMMA So ?QUESTIONMARK And I said ,COMMA So ?QUESTIONMARK So everything !EXCLAMATIONMARK And I turned to run .PERIOD I was so angry with him .PERIOD <BREAK>
And she said ,COMMA Listen .PERIOD The cut-off date to start kindergarten was September 15 .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA I took the bus downtown to get the new Libra poster .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA I was raised in the Pacific Northwest ,COMMA around a lot of Church of Latter-day Saints people and ,COMMA you know ,COMMA I've worked with them and even dated them ,COMMA but I never really knew the doctrine or what they said to people when they were out on a mission ,COMMA and I guess I was ,COMMA sort of ,COMMA curious ,COMMA so I said ,COMMA Well ,COMMA please ,COMMA come in .PERIOD And they looked really happy ,COMMA because I don't think this happens to them all that often .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I sat them down ,COMMA and I got them glasses of water -- OK ,COMMA I got it .PERIOD I got them glasses of water .PERIOD <BREAK>
And they told me this story all about this guy named Lehi ,COMMA who lived in Jerusalem in 600 BC .PERIOD <BREAK>
I wanted to say ,COMMA OK ,COMMA don't start with this story .PERIOD <BREAK>
I said ,COMMA Oh ,COMMA come on .PERIOD I mean ,COMMA even if women tried to have a baby every single year from the time they were 15 to the time they were 45 ,COMMA assuming they didn't die from exhaustion ,COMMA it still seems like some women would have some time left over to hear the word of God .PERIOD And they said ,COMMA No .PERIOD <BREAK>
And they said ,COMMA Oh -- hey ,COMMA well ,COMMA we also believe that when you go to heaven you get your body restored to you in its best original state .PERIOD <BREAK>
Or ,COMMA if you'd gone blind ,COMMA you could see .PERIOD <BREAK>
If someone came to my door and I was hearing Catholic theology and dogma for the very first time ,COMMA and they said ,COMMA We believe that God impregnated a very young girl without the use of intercourse ,COMMA and the fact that she was a virgin is maniacally important to us -- -- and she had a baby ,COMMA and that's the son of God ,COMMA I mean ,COMMA I would think that's equally ridiculous .PERIOD <BREAK>
Yes ,COMMA breast cancer .PERIOD <BREAK>
Overcome with the enormity of it all and the complete feeling of loss of control ,COMMA I shed copious tears and asked my dear husband ,COMMA Jayant .PERIOD <BREAK>
I danced between chemo and radiation cycles and badgered him to fit it to my performing dance schedule .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's the power of bringing ourselves to the attention of something that so animates you ,COMMA so moves you ,COMMA that something even like cancer becomes insignificant .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's the power of an image .PERIOD <BREAK>
Nobody really did anything with it ,COMMA pretty much .PERIOD <BREAK>
They brought all sorts of different computers with them .PERIOD <BREAK>
So that ,COMMA in all that diversity ,COMMA if I wanted to figure out how to build something out of a bit of this and a bit of this ,COMMA everything I looked into ,COMMA I had to connect to some new machine ,COMMA I had to learn to run some new program ,COMMA I would find the information I wanted in some new data format .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that is what has made it most fun .PERIOD <BREAK>
They're much more than we'd originally imagined when we put together the little ,COMMA initial website that we started off with .PERIOD <BREAK>
One of the great -- yes a lot of people have seen it -- one of the great TED Talks .PERIOD <BREAK>
Hans put up this presentation in which he showed ,COMMA for various different countries ,COMMA in various different colors -- he showed income levels on one axis and he showed infant mortality ,COMMA and he shot this thing animated through time .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA he'd taken this data and made a presentation which just shattered a lot of myths that people had about the economics in the developing world .PERIOD <BREAK>
It had underground all the data OK ,COMMA data is brown and boxy and boring ,COMMA and that's how we think of it ,COMMA isn't it ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
In this case ,COMMA Hans had put the data together he had found from all kinds of United Nations websites and things .PERIOD <BREAK>
We're using them for people ,COMMA we're using them for places ,COMMA we're using them for your products ,COMMA we're using them for events .PERIOD <BREAK>
I wrote an article entitled Linked Data a couple of years ago and soon after that ,COMMA things started to happen .PERIOD <BREAK>
OK ,COMMA we have to ask for raw data now .PERIOD <BREAK>
Practice that .PERIOD It's important because you have no idea the number of excuses people come up with to hang onto their data and not give it to you ,COMMA even though you've paid for it as a taxpayer .PERIOD <BREAK>
The people who are going to solve those -- the scientists -- they have half-formed ideas in their head ,COMMA they try to communicate those over the web .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that is what linked data is all about .PERIOD <BREAK>
You get this really huge power out of it .PERIOD <BREAK>
Then I realized that what I was getting from giving was a narcissistic hit -- that I felt good about myself .PERIOD <BREAK>
Right now ,COMMA as Bill McDonough has pointed out ,COMMA the objects that we buy and use have hidden consequences .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I spent a couple of weeks going around with a social work agency that ministered to the homeless .PERIOD And I realized seeing the homeless through their eyes that almost all of them were psychiatric patients that had nowhere to go .PERIOD They had a diagnosis .PERIOD It made me -- what it did was to shake me out of the urban trance where ,COMMA when we see ,COMMA when we're passing someone who's homeless in the periphery of our vision ,COMMA it stays on the periphery .PERIOD <BREAK>
One day soon after that -- it was a Friday -- at the end of the day ,COMMA I went down -- I was going down to the subway .PERIOD It was rush hour and thousands of people were streaming down the stairs .PERIOD <BREAK>
And ,COMMA anyway ,COMMA the next morning we had to go along to the jeweler and get it cut off .PERIOD <BREAK>
And then ,COMMA yes ,COMMA all these other ones as well .PERIOD I mean ,COMMA how do you do this ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
So I suppose you're not going to be able to kick me off the stage ,COMMA since you asked the question .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA just help us with some of the numbers .PERIOD <BREAK>
I mean ,COMMA how big is the group overall ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
No ,COMMA I mean ,COMMA I think -- CA :COLON But is that your hair ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
OK .PERIOD <BREAK>
Of course .PERIOD <BREAK>
Yeah ,COMMA well ,COMMA 25 years earlier ,COMMA we'd launched the Sex Pistols' God Save The Queen ,COMMA and I'd certainly never expected that 25 years later -- that she'd actually knight us .PERIOD <BREAK>
Well ,COMMA I got pulled out of the sea I think six times by helicopters ,COMMA so -- and each time ,COMMA I didn't expect to come home to tell the tale .PERIOD <BREAK>
But the ends of all those balloon trips were ,COMMA you know -- something seemed to go wrong every time ,COMMA and on that particular occasion ,COMMA the more experienced balloonist who was with me jumped ,COMMA and left me holding on for dear life .PERIOD <BREAK>
Yeah .PERIOD No ,COMMA I put on my oxygen mask and stood on top of the balloon ,COMMA with my parachute ,COMMA looking at the swirling clouds below ,COMMA trying to pluck up my courage to jump into the North Sea ,COMMA which -- and it was a very ,COMMA very ,COMMA very lonely few moments .PERIOD <BREAK>
The years -- and until I stopped looking at the polls ,COMMA you were sort of regarded as this great hero in the UK .PERIOD and elsewhere .PERIOD <BREAK>
OK ,COMMA this isn't exactly hardball .PERIOD OK .PERIOD <BREAK>
Didn't -- weren't you just terrible at school ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And generally ,COMMA the people would say ,COMMA oh ,COMMA well that's bad news .PERIOD <BREAK>
Did this really happen ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And making us go on wonderful ,COMMA long bike rides .PERIOD <BREAK>
But is there a risk here ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
I was actually prosecuted under two quite ancient acts in the UK .PERIOD <BREAK>
We changed it to social diseases and people came along with acne and spots ,COMMA but nobody came with VD any more .PERIOD <BREAK>
And John Mortimer ,COMMA the playwright ,COMMA defended us .PERIOD <BREAK>
So seriously ,COMMA is there a dark side ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
There was a nasty biography written about you by someone .PERIOD <BREAK>
I mean ,COMMA do you think about life balance ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
But the problem with capitalism is extreme wealth ends up in the hands of a few people ,COMMA and therefore extreme responsibility ,COMMA I think ,COMMA goes with that wealth .PERIOD <BREAK>
And is there a risk that the kind of the business heroes of the West get so excited about -- I mean ,COMMA they're used to having an idea ,COMMA getting stuff done ,COMMA and they believe profoundly in their ability to make a difference in the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
But I think business leaders can bring their entrepreneurial know-how and help governments approach things slightly differently .PERIOD <BREAK>
Well ,COMMA Richard ,COMMA when I was starting off in business ,COMMA I knew nothing about it and I also was sort of -- I thought that business people were supposed to just be ruthless and that that was the only way you could have a chance of succeeding .PERIOD <BREAK>
So I would like to thank you for that inspiration ,COMMA and for coming to TED today .PERIOD Thank you .PERIOD <BREAK>
I would say with a great smile ,COMMA I will definitely pass .PERIOD <BREAK>
He just started asking ,COMMA Where did you buy the radio ?QUESTIONMARK How much is it ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And he said ,COMMA Oh ,COMMA I teach at a college of arts .PERIOD <BREAK>
It can be ruins ,COMMA or it can be music ,COMMA or it can be painting or drawing or writing ,COMMA whatever it is .PERIOD <BREAK>
But it is just a kind of trace of that time .PERIOD <BREAK>
So it took about 24 hours to get this line .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA what we see is just what we think often ,COMMA and most of the time ,COMMA we don't see what it is .PERIOD <BREAK>
So this work from this period is mostly like -- you know ,COMMA this is a work called Light Makes Dark .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is an exact negative .PERIOD <BREAK>
But a solution arrived after being quiet and not working for about six ,COMMA seven months ,COMMA in the restroom ,COMMA when I was changing the air freshener that goes from solid substance to vapor .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is the work I made out of that material .PERIOD <BREAK>
So I told them ,COMMA I'd like to start an air freshener company .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA I just started doing this work to inquire further about how to sculpt the space between this object and there .PERIOD <BREAK>
Because ,COMMA as a visual artist ,COMMA if I'm seeing this and I'm seeing that -- but how to sculpt this ,COMMA you know ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
It's the same in marketing .PERIOD <BREAK>
It only took one robust observation from Copernicus to blow that idea out of the water .PERIOD <BREAK>
Take BP -- they spent millions of pounds over many years building up its credentials as an environmentally friendly brand ,COMMA but then one little accident .PERIOD <BREAK>
The same is true of marketing .PERIOD <BREAK>
It makes this distribution of energy a democratizing force ,COMMA which is ultimately good for your brand .PERIOD <BREAK>
I see you're all up on the history of hurdy-gurdy -- vielle à roue .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's also the only instrument that uses this kind of technique .PERIOD <BREAK>
And today ,COMMA the hurdy-gurdy is used in all sorts of music -- traditional folk music ,COMMA dance ,COMMA contemporary and world music -- in the UK ,COMMA in France ,COMMA in Spain and in Italy .PERIOD <BREAK>
But the moment you fall in love ,COMMA you become extremely sexually possessive of them .PERIOD <BREAK>
But the main characteristics of romantic love are craving :COLON an intense craving to be with a particular person ,COMMA not just sexually ,COMMA but emotionally .PERIOD <BREAK>
And then ,COMMA the very last question I would ask them -- I would always have to work myself up to this question ,COMMA because I am not a psychologist .PERIOD <BREAK>
The motor of the brain .PERIOD It's a drive .PERIOD <BREAK>
And in fact ,COMMA I think it's more powerful than the sex drive .PERIOD <BREAK>
You know ,COMMA you can feel it when you're just driving along in your car .PERIOD <BREAK>
I think romantic love evolved to enable you to focus your mating energy on just one individual at a time ,COMMA thereby conserving mating time and energy .PERIOD <BREAK>
They've got incredible people skills ,COMMA negotiating skills .PERIOD <BREAK>
They're highly imaginative .PERIOD <BREAK>
And -- basic math !EXCLAMATIONMARK <BREAK>
We are seeing the rise of female sexual expression .PERIOD <BREAK>
Indeed ,COMMA arranged marriages are on their way off this braid of human life .PERIOD <BREAK>
I even think that marriages might even become more stable because of the second great world trend .PERIOD <BREAK>
It may decline some more .PERIOD <BREAK>
Not at any time on this planet have women been so educated ,COMMA so interesting ,COMMA so capable .PERIOD <BREAK>
However ,COMMA there's always kinds of complications in this .PERIOD <BREAK>
In these three brain systems :COLON lust ,COMMA romantic love and attachment -- don't always go together .PERIOD <BREAK>
But I want to tell you a story about -- to illustrate .PERIOD <BREAK>
I've been carrying on here about the biology of love .PERIOD <BREAK>
And ,COMMA Wasn't that rickshaw driver handsome !EXCLAMATIONMARK <BREAK>
These circuits are deeply embedded in the human brain .PERIOD <BREAK>
They're going to survive as long as our species survives on what Shakespeare called this mortal coil .PERIOD <BREAK>
One of the threads that seems to have come through loud and clear in the last couple of days is this need to reconcile what the Big wants -- the Big being the organization ,COMMA the system ,COMMA the country -- and what the Small wants -- the individual ,COMMA the person .PERIOD <BREAK>
Charlie Ledbetter ,COMMA yesterday ,COMMA I thought ,COMMA talked very articulately about this need to bring consumers ,COMMA to bring people into the process of creating things .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that's what I want to talk about today .PERIOD <BREAK>
319 .PERIOD <BREAK>
I think something happens .PERIOD I think a head may appear in a second .PERIOD <BREAK>
We showed them the whole cut ,COMMA and they were all completely ,COMMA what is this ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And the point is when you lie in a hospital bed all day ,COMMA all you do is look at the roof ,COMMA and it's a really shitty experience .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's a history of invention based around this .PERIOD <BREAK>
When we actually went and watched this procedure taking place -- and I'll explain this in a second -- it became very obvious that there was a human dimension to this that they really weren't recognizing .PERIOD <BREAK>
Why do we line up the square milk carton with the square fence ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Because we kind of have to -- we're just compelled to .PERIOD <BREAK>
We don't know why ,COMMA but we do .PERIOD <BREAK>
So what is this ?QUESTIONMARK I hear you all ask .PERIOD No ,COMMA I don't .PERIOD <BREAK>
So what seems like a very clunky product is ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA incredibly useful .PERIOD <BREAK>
These guys are using this very successfully .PERIOD <BREAK>
How far you can anticipate ,COMMA what follows from it ,COMMA what are the threats ,COMMA what are the possibilities ,COMMA the challenges ,COMMA the opportunities ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And all the components are there which are now in common parlance ,COMMA in our vocabulary ,COMMA you know ,COMMA 30 -odd years later :COLON wind energy ,COMMA recycling ,COMMA biomass ,COMMA solar cells .PERIOD <BREAK>
For example ,COMMA if ,COMMA in that Bucky-inspired phrase ,COMMA we draw back and we look at planet Earth ,COMMA and we take a kind of typical ,COMMA industrialized society ,COMMA then the energy consumed would be split between the buildings ,COMMA 44 percent ,COMMA transport ,COMMA 34 percent ,COMMA and industry .PERIOD <BREAK>
If you compared Detroit with a city of a Northern European example -- and Munich is not a bad example of that ,COMMA with the greater dependence on walking and cycling -- then a city which is really only twice as dense ,COMMA is only using one-tenth of the energy .PERIOD <BREAK>
In other words ,COMMA you take these comparable examples and the energy leap is enormous .PERIOD <BREAK>
How does it affect the design of buildings ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
The one example I take is a corporate headquarters for a company called Willis and Faber ,COMMA in a small market town in the northeast of England ,COMMA commuting distance with London .PERIOD <BREAK>
This building was wired for change .PERIOD <BREAK>
In other words ,COMMA we didn't have the technology to do what would be really interesting on that building .PERIOD <BREAK>
And if I fast-forward in time ,COMMA what is interesting is that the technology is now available and celebratory .PERIOD <BREAK>
The library of the Free University ,COMMA which opened last year ,COMMA is an example of that .PERIOD <BREAK>
So it's not a kind of sacrifice ,COMMA quite the reverse .PERIOD <BREAK>
And just to give a sort of glimpse of that technology ,COMMA the ability to plot points in the sky and to transmit ,COMMA to transfer that information now ,COMMA directly into the factory .PERIOD <BREAK>
For wind tunnels ,COMMA we would literally put them in a wind tunnel and blast air ,COMMA and the many kilometers of cable and so on .PERIOD <BREAK>
I mean ,COMMA major transformation .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's been well known that the Dead Sea is dying .PERIOD <BREAK>
How do you make them more friendly at that scale ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Hong Kong I refer to as a kind of analog experience in a digital age ,COMMA because you always have a point of reference .PERIOD <BREAK>
250 -- excuse me ,COMMA 50000 people working 24 hours ,COMMA seven days .PERIOD <BREAK>
Contagious is a good word .PERIOD <BREAK>
Laughter is contagious .PERIOD Passion is contagious .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that directly increased student wellbeing .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that can't happen in a classroom .PERIOD <BREAK>
And Ahmedabad got the first child-friendly zebra crossing in the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
Man :COLON This program is wonderful .PERIOD <BREAK>
We have to start collecting from 555 .PERIOD <BREAK>
KBS :COLON So ,COMMA the charter of compassion starts right here .PERIOD <BREAK>
It was incredible .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA I was paid in dollars as a consultant ,COMMA and I looked at my income tax return and tried to ask myself :COLON Is there a line in my return ,COMMA which shows how much of this income has gone to the people whose knowledge has made it possible ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
I tried to convince myself that ,COMMA No ,COMMA no ,COMMA I have worked for the policy changes .PERIOD <BREAK>
And this was a moment of great pain and trauma because I couldn't live with it any longer .PERIOD <BREAK>
In fact ,COMMA they invite the honey bees through their colors ,COMMA and the bees don't keep all the honey for themselves .PERIOD <BREAK>
These are the three guiding principles of the Honey Bee Network :COLON that whenever we learn something from people it must be shared with them in their language .PERIOD <BREAK>
You cannot discriminate .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'm so sorry to say that .PERIOD <BREAK>
The rice that you ate in the lunch ,COMMA and you will eat today ,COMMA is transplanted by women bending in a very awkward posture ,COMMA millions of them ,COMMA every season ,COMMA in the paddy season ,COMMA when they transplant paddy with their feet in the water .PERIOD <BREAK>
And feet in the water will develop fungus ,COMMA infections ,COMMA and that infection pains because then other insects bite that point .PERIOD <BREAK>
And this is what he got painted .PERIOD <BREAK>
There could be nothing more wrong than the Maslowian model of hierarchy of needs because the poorest people in this country can get enlightenment .PERIOD <BREAK>
So here's a model where a two-wheeler washing machine .PERIOD <BREAK>
So it is better ,COMMA it is safer ;SEMICOLON it is affordable ,COMMA it is energy-efficient .PERIOD <BREAK>
So why are people willing to adjust with that mismatch ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
For example ,COMMA cell phones :COLON We have 400 million cellphones in this country .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA the eminent model ,COMMA the long-tail model tells you that small sales of a large number of books ,COMMA for example ,COMMA having only a few copies sold can still be a viable model .PERIOD <BREAK>
Look at what he is doing .PERIOD <BREAK>
But he has modified a two-wheeler so that he can get autonomy and freedom and flexibility .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we have a very vibrant network in China ,COMMA particularly ,COMMA but also emerging in Brazil and other parts of the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
I can't change the condition of the road ,COMMA but I can make the cycle run faster .PERIOD <BREAK>
And this is a donkey cart which they modified .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is in China .PERIOD This girl needed a breathing apparatus .PERIOD <BREAK>
There's a whole range of innovations that we have .PERIOD <BREAK>
A car ,COMMA which runs on compressed air with six paisa per kilometer .PERIOD <BREAK>
And he didn't mean the comfort of a five-course dinner as opposed to a one-course meal ,COMMA but he really meant the comfort of the quality of the building for the people .PERIOD <BREAK>
So in an indirect way ,COMMA you can see the sun .PERIOD <BREAK>
And what they did is they created an integral building element to improve the quality of the space that surrounds the visitors of the museum .PERIOD <BREAK>
They created this shade that you can see here ,COMMA which actually covers the sun ,COMMA but opens up to the good light from the sky .PERIOD <BREAK>
They allowed themselves a few mistakes along the way .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is Richard Kelly who was born 100 years ago ,COMMA which is the reason I bring him up now ,COMMA because it's kind of an anniversary year .PERIOD <BREAK>
He meant something like this -- where the light gives direction to the space and helps you to get around .PERIOD <BREAK>
These three distinct elements ,COMMA together ,COMMA make a lighting environment that helps us to feel better .PERIOD <BREAK>
How do they share their culture ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
The problem is though that I wanted to explain to you how this really works -- but I can have four of these on my finger ,COMMA so you would not to be able to really see them .PERIOD <BREAK>
So just to explain .PERIOD <BREAK>
Why are all these motorways permanently lit ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Can we maybe be much more selective and create better environments that also benefit from darkness ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Can we engage people more in the lighting projects that we create ,COMMA so they really want to connect with it ,COMMA like here ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Where have they come from ?QUESTIONMARK Where are they going ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And it only embodies all these stories and all this suspense because of the darkness and the light .PERIOD <BREAK>
They pointed out that ,COMMA I believe it was between 30 and 50 years from today ,COMMA they will be steering cars by wire ,COMMA without all that mechanical stuff .PERIOD <BREAK>
It really was a big idea in technology when we started applying it in the iBOT for the disabled community .PERIOD <BREAK>
The big idea here is ,COMMA I think ,COMMA a new piece of a solution to a fairly big problem in transportation .PERIOD <BREAK>
For instance ,COMMA in that time ,COMMA 91 percent of America lived either on farms or in small towns .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA the car -- the horseless carriage that replaced the horse and carriage -- was a big deal ;SEMICOLON it went twice as fast as a horse and carriage .PERIOD <BREAK>
It all made sense ,COMMA with 91 percent of the people living there .PERIOD <BREAK>
Three million people die every year in cities due to bad air ,COMMA and almost all particulate pollution on this planet is produced by transportation devices ,COMMA particularly sitting in cities .PERIOD <BREAK>
I don't look like a motor vehicle .PERIOD <BREAK>
We're a recreational vehicle that doesn't really matter ,COMMA and I don't spend my time doing that kind of stuff .PERIOD <BREAK>
Then she looks up ,COMMA she's looking up ,COMMA and she says ,COMMA And I'm 81 years old ,COMMA and I don't drive a car anymore .PERIOD <BREAK>
We need water .PERIOD <BREAK>
We figured out how to put a vapor-compression distiller on this thing ,COMMA with a counter-flow heat exchanger to take the waste heat ,COMMA then using a little bit of the electricity control that process ,COMMA and for 450 watts ,COMMA which is a little more than half of its waste heat ,COMMA it will make 10 gallons an hour of distilled water from anything that comes into it to cool it .PERIOD <BREAK>
So if we put this box on here in a few years ,COMMA could we have a solution to transportation ,COMMA electricity ,COMMA and communication ,COMMA and maybe drinkable water in a sustainable package that weighs 60 pounds ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
We tend to do any technology that we think is sufficiently important ;SEMICOLON we'll typically do it twice .PERIOD Once ,COMMA we want to do it first .PERIOD <BREAK>
And then it's time to do it again .PERIOD Last year .PERIOD <BREAK>
After it falls below a critical price ,COMMA it will tend ,COMMA if it's successful ,COMMA to rise above a critical mass ,COMMA a penetration .PERIOD <BREAK>
And maybe you have reasons for starting to connect them ,COMMA and bring the rest of your entertainment in .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is a fascinating research from WHO that shows the effect of generic drugs on anti-retroviral drug compounds and cocktails .PERIOD <BREAK>
Linux is another good example .PERIOD <BREAK>
Two percent isn't 20 percent ,COMMA but in the car business ,COMMA which is slow moving ,COMMA that's huge ;SEMICOLON that's arrival .PERIOD <BREAK>
Free is something that comes with digital ,COMMA because the reproduction costs are essentially free .PERIOD It comes with IP ,COMMA because it's such an efficient protocol .PERIOD It comes with fiber optics ,COMMA because there's so much bandwidth .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's an economic force ;SEMICOLON it's a technical force .PERIOD <BREAK>
You know ,COMMA there could be a film's [unclear] there ,COMMA but it's basically ,COMMA every song ever made could be stored on 400 dollars worth of storage by 2008 .PERIOD It takes that entire element ,COMMA the physical element ,COMMA of songs off the table .PERIOD <BREAK>
Because of some of technologies we've been talking about .PERIOD <BREAK>
And by definition ,COMMA every one of you who is in this room must consider yourself a global soul ,COMMA a global citizen .PERIOD <BREAK>
Even more problematic ,COMMA they're not listening to poor people themselves .PERIOD <BREAK>
In 2002 I met this incredible entrepreneur named Amitabha Sadangi from India ,COMMA who'd been working for 20 years with some of the poorest farmers on the planet .PERIOD <BREAK>
And he was expressing his frustration that the aid market had bypassed low-income farmers altogether ,COMMA despite the fact that 200 million farmers alone in India make under a dollar a day .PERIOD <BREAK>
But the market also had bypassed low income farmers ,COMMA because these systems were both too expensive ,COMMA and they were constructed for fields that were too large .PERIOD <BREAK>
In fact ,COMMA when you go back to the beginning ,COMMA there were no private investors who would be willing to take a risk on building a new technology for a market class that made under a dollar a day ,COMMA that were known to be some of the most risk-averse people on the planet and that were working in one of the riskiest sectors ,COMMA agriculture .PERIOD <BREAK>
Secondarily ,COMMA we wanted to see if we could export this drip irrigation and bring it into other countries .PERIOD <BREAK>
In Arusha ,COMMA Tanzania ,COMMA A to Z Textile Manufacturing has worked in partnership with us ,COMMA with UNICEF ,COMMA with the Global Fund ,COMMA to create a factory that now employs 7000 people ,COMMA mostly women .PERIOD <BREAK>
So that in the terrorist attacks of November they were the first responder ,COMMA and are now beginning to scale ,COMMA because of partnership .PERIOD <BREAK>
President Obama understands that .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's not hyperbole to say that these civil society institutions and these social entrepreneurs are building real alternatives to the Taliban .PERIOD <BREAK>
It was about 115 degrees .PERIOD <BREAK>
And because I wanted to impress you all with slides ,COMMA since I saw the great presentations yesterday with graphs ,COMMA I made a graph that moves ,COMMA and I talk about the makeup of me .PERIOD <BREAK>
During the hurricane ,COMMA you had MSNBC posting about the hurricane on their blog ,COMMA updating it frequently .PERIOD This was possible because of the easy nature of blogging tools .PERIOD <BREAK>
They sent a search party ,COMMA and I overheard people saying they wish I had killed myself ,COMMA jumped off Bible Peak .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I won it .PERIOD I reached all of these people ,COMMA and I had tens of thousands of people reading about my life everyday .PERIOD <BREAK>
And then I wrote a post about a banjo .PERIOD <BREAK>
And my husband -- this is my husband ,COMMA who is very hot -- he won an award for being hot -- -- he told me ,COMMA You cannot buy a banjo .PERIOD <BREAK>
And those people who know me understood my joke .PERIOD <BREAK>
How much money does he spend on beer in a year ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And then I got people saying ,COMMA Leave him .PERIOD <BREAK>
And why are they reading this ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
This is not science ,COMMA but this was enough for me to be really so interested in how we have evolved and how we can trace our line .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is the only picture I have .PERIOD And to think of what we have the ability to do with our blogs ;SEMICOLON to think about the people who are on those $ 100 computers talking about who they are ,COMMA sharing these personal stories -- this is an amazing thing .PERIOD <BREAK>
And -- and so I printed out her -- or I sent a PDF of her blog to her family ,COMMA and they passed it out at her memorial service ,COMMA and even in her obituary ,COMMA they mentioned her blog because it was such a big part of her life .PERIOD <BREAK>
You can see in its shape and its streamlined design it's powered for ocean swimming .PERIOD <BREAK>
It flies through the ocean on its pectoral fins ,COMMA gets lift ,COMMA powers its movements with a lunate tail .PERIOD <BREAK>
This tuna symbolizes what's the problem for all of us in the room .PERIOD <BREAK>
So take a look at that animal .PERIOD <BREAK>
So in a program called Tag-A-Giant we've actually gone from Ireland to Canada ,COMMA from Corsica to Spain .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that's the fisheries off the state of North Carolina .PERIOD <BREAK>
They're coming together .PERIOD That could be tuna sex -- and there it is .PERIOD <BREAK>
So from data like this ,COMMA we're able now to put the map up ,COMMA and in this map you see thousands of positions generated by this decade and a half of tagging .PERIOD <BREAK>
Salmon sharks go down to the tropics to pup and come into Monterey .PERIOD <BREAK>
We just need to put it together .PERIOD <BREAK>
We have the technology that's shown us where it is .PERIOD <BREAK>
Hi there .PERIOD I'm Hasan .PERIOD I'm an artist .PERIOD <BREAK>
Basically this is the FBI offices in Tampa where I spent six months of my life -- back and forth ,COMMA not six months continuously .PERIOD <BREAK>
Or questions such as -- actually ,COMMA during the polygraph ,COMMA which was how it finally ended after nine consecutive of them -- one of the polygraph questions was .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it's like ,COMMA Guys ,COMMA I travel a lot .PERIOD <BREAK>
Don't want to make it look like I'm making any sudden moves .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so I just kept doing this over and over and over .PERIOD <BREAK>
Then I'd make websites .PERIOD <BREAK>
So you can see ,COMMA Delta 1252 going from Kansas City to Atlanta .PERIOD <BREAK>
This was on Delta 719 going from JFK to San Francisco .PERIOD <BREAK>
These are the airports that I hang out in ,COMMA because I like airports .PERIOD <BREAK>
But if you can cross-reference this with the other data ,COMMA then you're basically replaying the roll of the FBI agent and putting it all together .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is exactly where my old apartment in San Francisco was .PERIOD <BREAK>
And then sometimes you get this .PERIOD <BREAK>
So there's multiple databases .PERIOD <BREAK>
So there's different categorizations of meals eaten outside empty train stations ,COMMA empty gas stations .PERIOD <BREAK>
At 156 pm .PERIOD was this one .PERIOD At 459 pm .PERIOD was this one .PERIOD <BREAK>
Every few moments I shoot the image .PERIOD <BREAK>
So by me putting all this information out there ,COMMA what I'm basically telling you is I'm telling you everything .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the reason their information has any value is ,COMMA well ,COMMA because no one else has access to it .PERIOD <BREAK>
And by me cutting out the middle man and giving it straight to you ,COMMA the information that the FBI has has no value ,COMMA so thus devaluing their currency .PERIOD <BREAK>
So in a way ,COMMA I'm glad that I'm completely obsolete .PERIOD <BREAK>
And you know ,COMMA some of my friends have always said ,COMMA Hey ,COMMA you're just paranoid .PERIOD Why are you doing this ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
So you can see that the Homeland Security likes to come by -- Department of Homeland Security .PERIOD <BREAK>
Bruno Giussani :COLON Hasan ,COMMA just curious .PERIOD <BREAK>
So it's just become another day .PERIOD <BREAK>
And everything's automated at the other end .PERIOD <BREAK>
On the day you are in a place where there is no coverage ,COMMA the FBI gets crazy ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Well it goes to the last point that I was at .PERIOD <BREAK>
Hasan ,COMMA thank you very much .PERIOD <BREAK>
You all know the truth of what I'm going to say .PERIOD <BREAK>
But first ,COMMA see what a miserable lot we are .PERIOD <BREAK>
Even the people just below the top have less good health than the people at the top .PERIOD <BREAK>
And there ,COMMA you see it in relation to the measure of inequality I've just shown you ,COMMA which I shall use over and over again in the data .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's very important in poorer countries ,COMMA but not in the rich developed world .PERIOD <BREAK>
But in the more equal societies ,COMMA it rises to 60 or 65 percent .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is violence .PERIOD <BREAK>
There's a about a tenfold difference there ,COMMA log scale up the side .PERIOD <BREAK>
But it goes from about 40 to 400 people in prison .PERIOD <BREAK>
Basically ,COMMA it's asking :COLON do rich fathers have rich sons and poor fathers have poor sons ,COMMA or is there no relationship between the two ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
One is that ,COMMA in graph after graph ,COMMA we find the countries that do worse ,COMMA whatever the outcome ,COMMA seem to be the more unequal ones ,COMMA and the ones that do well seem to be the Nordic countries and Japan .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's not just one or two things that go wrong ,COMMA it's most things .PERIOD <BREAK>
I am not talking about perfect equality ,COMMA I'm talking about what exists in rich developed market democracies .PERIOD <BREAK>
It also leads to status insecurity .PERIOD <BREAK>
The big change in our understanding of drivers of chronic health in the rich developed world is how important chronic stress from social sources is affecting the immune system ,COMMA the cardiovascular system .PERIOD <BREAK>
Thank you .PERIOD <BREAK>
Well ,COMMA I didn't have that in mind ,COMMA so .PERIOD <BREAK>
The acid will ruin the gold plating .PERIOD <BREAK>
Beneath it is a wonderful knife .PERIOD <BREAK>
No .PERIOD But is it fun ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
So I type design emotion and my website wasn't first again .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's so much fun to drive .PERIOD <BREAK>
And then ,COMMA a psychologist ,COMMA Alice Isen ,COMMA did this wonderful experiment .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA she'd bring people into the room ,COMMA and there'd be a string hanging down here and a string hanging down here .PERIOD <BREAK>
You get a little problem ,COMMA you say ,COMMA Ah ,COMMA I'll figure it out .PERIOD <BREAK>
There's an amazing amount of stuff that's built into the brain .PERIOD <BREAK>
Behavioral is subconscious ,COMMA you're unaware of it .PERIOD <BREAK>
Almost everything we do is subconscious .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the tea is sitting in this stuff to the right -- the tea is to the right of this line .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the reason you might buy it now is because you care about the environment .PERIOD <BREAK>
The other neat thing .PERIOD <BREAK>
So that's the new me .PERIOD <BREAK>
The graph was interesting ,COMMA although you need to consider it carefully .PERIOD <BREAK>
It did not correlate with the size of classrooms .PERIOD <BREAK>
If you took the same technology and piloted it into one of those remote schools ,COMMA where the score was 30 percent ,COMMA and ,COMMA let's say ,COMMA took that up to 40 percent -- that will be a completely different thing .PERIOD <BREAK>
The last question is what everybody said ,COMMA but you know ,COMMA I mean ,COMMA they must have poked their head over the wall and asked the people in your office ,COMMA can you show me how to do it ,COMMA and then somebody taught him .PERIOD <BREAK>
He came there and he started to fiddle around with the touchpad .PERIOD <BREAK>
I left the computer there with lots of CDs -- I didn't have any Internet -- and came back three months later .PERIOD <BREAK>
And as soon as they saw me they said ,COMMA We need a faster processor and a better mouse .PERIOD <BREAK>
So I said ,COMMA But how did you understand what's going on over there ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
So then I measured ,COMMA and they were using 200 English words with each other -- mispronounced ,COMMA but correct usage -- words like exit ,COMMA stop ,COMMA find ,COMMA save ,COMMA that kind of thing ,COMMA not only to do with the computer but in their day-to-day conversations .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is the Himalayas .PERIOD Up in the north ,COMMA very cold .PERIOD <BREAK>
I want to just cut this short .PERIOD We did this over and over again .PERIOD <BREAK>
So if they have access to the computer ,COMMA they will teach themselves ,COMMA including intelligence .PERIOD <BREAK>
But we got a clean learning curve ,COMMA almost exactly the same as what you would get in a school .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'll leave it at that ,COMMA because ,COMMA I mean ,COMMA it sort of says it all ,COMMA doesn't it ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
An educational technology and pedagogy that is digital ,COMMA automatic ,COMMA fault-tolerant ,COMMA minimally invasive ,COMMA connected and self-organized .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it's about rediscovering idealism in all of that wreckage .PERIOD <BREAK>
I negotiated with Saddam's diplomats at the UN .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'd already served in Germany ,COMMA Norway ,COMMA various other places ,COMMA but I was posted to New York to serve on the UN .PERIOD Security Council for the British delegation .PERIOD <BREAK>
And there ,COMMA I dealt with things like the Middle East peace process ,COMMA the Lockerbie issue -- we can talk about that later ,COMMA if you wish -- but above all ,COMMA my responsibility was Iraq and its weapons of mass destruction and the sanctions we placed on Iraq to oblige it to disarm itself of these weapons .PERIOD <BREAK>
I decided to take a sabbatical ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA at the New School ,COMMA Bruce .PERIOD <BREAK>
So took a running leap and jumped over the edge of a cliff .PERIOD <BREAK>
But ,COMMA in a way ,COMMA I've got used to the sensation of it .PERIOD <BREAK>
A lot of my friends were still in it .PERIOD <BREAK>
It was anarchy .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it's a very horrible thing to see anarchy ,COMMA to know that the police and the military -- there were lots of military troops there -- actually can't stop that rampaging mob who's coming down the street .PERIOD <BREAK>
They were not allowed a foreign office to help them deal with this immensely complicated process ,COMMA which became known as the Final Status Process of Kosovo .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I came to Kosovo and advised the Kosovo government .PERIOD <BREAK>
If they can't do it ,COMMA who's left to deal with it ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
So we will be bringing Darfuri rebel groups ,COMMA the Northern Cypriots and the Southern Cypriots ,COMMA rebels from Aceh ,COMMA and awful long laundry list of chaotic conflicts around the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
That is the politics of the 21 st century ,COMMA and in a way ,COMMA Independent Diplomat embodies that fragmentation ,COMMA that change ,COMMA that is happening to all of us .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now today ,COMMA we're not talking about good and bad TV .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is something that clearly separates us from the animal kingdom .PERIOD <BREAK>
Is television literally functioning as our conscience ,COMMA tempting us and rewarding us at the same time ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
We surveyed the top- 20 Nielsen shows every year for 50 years -- a thousand shows .PERIOD <BREAK>
Viewers had responded dramatically .PERIOD <BREAK>
This was the first show that allowed viewers to say ,COMMA My God ,COMMA I can comment on how I feel about the Vietnam War ,COMMA about the presidency ,COMMA through television ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
It can change us ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
That's mapped against the red dot ,COMMA unemployment ,COMMA which is a simple Bureau of Labor Department statistic .PERIOD <BREAK>
We had the bursting of the tech bubble .PERIOD <BREAK>
I can vote you off the island .PERIOD <BREAK>
There has not been a decade of television without a definitive ,COMMA dominant TV mom .PERIOD <BREAK>
Maude Findlay ,COMMA the epitome of the irreverent 1970 s ,COMMA who tackled abortion ,COMMA divorce ,COMMA even menopause on TV .PERIOD <BREAK>
Murphy Brown took on a vice president when she took on the idea of single parenthood .PERIOD <BREAK>
This era's mom ,COMMA Bree Van de Kamp .PERIOD <BREAK>
So here's the metaphor I'm offering today .PERIOD <BREAK>
Previous to this time ,COMMA I was very selfish and self-righteous .PERIOD <BREAK>
And on this higher level he becomes loving and forgiving .PERIOD <BREAK>
But here's the weirdest place of all :COLON war .PERIOD <BREAK>
I passes insensibly into a we ,COMMA my becomes our and individual faith loses its central importance .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now profane is the opposite of sacred .PERIOD <BREAK>
It just means ordinary or common .PERIOD <BREAK>
Durkheim believed that anything that unites us takes on an air of sacredness .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'm offering the metaphor of a staircase in the mind .PERIOD <BREAK>
So here's the million-dollar question for social scientists like me :COLON Is the staircase a feature of our evolutionary design ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Or is it a bug ,COMMA a mistake in the system -- this religious stuff is just something that happens when the wires cross in the brain -- Jill has a stroke and she has this religious experience ,COMMA it's just a mistake ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
There's a mutation in the gene and one of them mutates to follow a selfish strategy .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's so big and powerful and efficient that it can take resources from the greens ,COMMA from the defectors ,COMMA the cheaters .PERIOD <BREAK>
And pretty soon the whole population is actually composed of these new superorganisms .PERIOD <BREAK>
We're not locked into cooperation the way bees and ants are .PERIOD <BREAK>
We're bees .PERIOD We busted out of the hive during the Enlightenment .PERIOD <BREAK>
We unleashed Earth-changing creativity and generated vast wealth and comfort .PERIOD <BREAK>
What's missing ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And that gives me hope because people are not purely selfish .PERIOD <BREAK>
Every man is a piece of the continent ,COMMA a part of the main .PERIOD <BREAK>
Thank you .PERIOD <BREAK>
There was no more space in the house .PERIOD So I went out to the backyard ,COMMA and without any previous building experience ,COMMA and about 3000 dollars and some recycled materials ,COMMA I built this space .PERIOD <BREAK>
There was enough space .PERIOD And I had control ,COMMA which was very important .PERIOD <BREAK>
He won the silver medal for Ireland in the 1992 Olympics ,COMMA and he trains in this space .PERIOD He trains other people .PERIOD <BREAK>
Museum quality .PERIOD <BREAK>
I had requested slides ,COMMA kind of adamantly ,COMMA up till the -- pretty much ,COMMA last few days ,COMMA but was denied access to a slide projector .PERIOD <BREAK>
These are a couple of garage doors painted identical ,COMMA situated next to each other .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA here's the first door .PERIOD You know ,COMMA you get the message .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is for a book by Metropolis .PERIOD <BREAK>
When I first contacted William Burroughs about being part of it ,COMMA he said no ;SEMICOLON he said he didn't believe it was the end of print .PERIOD <BREAK>
And also ,COMMA surprisingly ,COMMA it was done in kind of a cheap metal ,COMMA and it had completely rusted through ,COMMA and water everywhere ,COMMA and spiders .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I thought ,COMMA you know ,COMMA what were they thinking ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Got no way of tracking it ,COMMA so I could be totally wrong .PERIOD <BREAK>
I don't have the site .PERIOD It's just the piece itself .PERIOD <BREAK>
I found out that's very true ,COMMA working on this campaign worldwide .PERIOD <BREAK>
But anyway ,COMMA this is one of the ads I was most pleased with ,COMMA because they were all elaborately art-directed ,COMMA and this one I thought actually felt like the girl was looking at the computer .PERIOD <BREAK>
In Germany ,COMMA they made one small change without checking with me -- nor did they have to ,COMMA because it was done through agencies -- but see if you can tell the difference .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA I understand their logic .PERIOD I totally disagree with it ;SEMICOLON I think it's a very small-minded approach ,COMMA the world is certainly much more global ,COMMA and I certainly think the people of Germany could have handled a little black girl sitting in front of a computer ,COMMA though we'll never know .PERIOD <BREAK>
Article on Bryan Ferry -- just really boring article -- so I set the whole article in Dingbat .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's kind of horsey type ,COMMA but the texture -- the second plane not quite hitting :COLON there was something more enticing ,COMMA if that's the right -- it's not the right word -- but in this cover than Time or Newsweek .PERIOD <BREAK>
It did not let up .PERIOD <BREAK>
There were a lot of orphans made this day ,COMMA and here's a dead body being brought out .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is my desktop .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is -- I like found art ;SEMICOLON hand lettering's coming back in a big way ,COMMA and I thought this was a great example of both .PERIOD <BREAK>
But I was asked to give a talk at a conference in Sacramento a few years back .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I remembered seeing this photograph of my father ,COMMA who was a test pilot ,COMMA and he told me that when you signed up to become a test pilot ,COMMA they told you that there was a 40 to 50 percent chance of death on the job .PERIOD <BREAK>
I've spent the past year thinking about what it really should be about .PERIOD <BREAK>
Before that ,COMMA obviously ,COMMA technology didn't exist .PERIOD But obviously it did .PERIOD <BREAK>
But it's still very ,COMMA very productive .PERIOD So I'm attempting to say ,COMMA if we take technology's view of the world ,COMMA what does it want ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And I think once we ask that question we have to go back ,COMMA actually ,COMMA to life .PERIOD Because obviously ,COMMA if we keep extending the origins of technology far back ,COMMA I think we come back to life at some point .PERIOD <BREAK>
Brian Farrell's work is all part of this agenda to try and actually discover all the species on Earth .PERIOD <BREAK>
More and more of the inert matter of the globe is being touched and animated by life .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the last thing ,COMMA I bring back this nudibranch .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so the general ,COMMA long-term trends of evolution are roughly these five :COLON ubiquity ,COMMA diversity ,COMMA specialization ,COMMA complexity and socialization .PERIOD Now ,COMMA I took that and said ,COMMA OK ,COMMA what are the long-term trends in technology ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
That we see there's a general hammer ,COMMA and hammers become more and more specific over time .PERIOD <BREAK>
There's obviously diversity .PERIOD Huge numbers of things .PERIOD <BREAK>
So the major trends in technology evolution actually are the same as in biological evolution .PERIOD The same drives that we see towards ubiquity ,COMMA towards diversity ,COMMA towards socialization ,COMMA towards complexity .PERIOD That is maybe not a big surprise because if we map out ,COMMA say ,COMMA the evolution of armor ,COMMA you can actually follow a sort of an evolutionary-type cladistic tree .PERIOD <BREAK>
He has one of the world's largest collections -- about 500 of them .PERIOD <BREAK>
But the most interesting aspect about this is that if you look at those red lines at the bottom ,COMMA those indicate basically a parentage of a type of cornet that was no longer made .PERIOD That does not happen in biology .PERIOD <BREAK>
And when we take that ,COMMA we take this idea of what culture is doing and add it to what the long-term trajectory -- again ,COMMA in life's evolution -- we find that each case -- each of the major transitions in life -- what they're really about is accelerating and changing the way in which evolution happens .PERIOD <BREAK>
So all these steps in evolution are increasing ,COMMA basically ,COMMA the evolution of evolvability .PERIOD <BREAK>
So if you have life hacking -- life means hacking ,COMMA the game of survival -- then evolution is a way to extend the game by changing the rules of the game .PERIOD <BREAK>
And each time we make a new opportunity place ,COMMA we're allowing a platform to make new ones .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's what technology wants .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'm going ,COMMA My gosh !EXCLAMATIONMARK I had never seen anything like this in my life !EXCLAMATIONMARK <BREAK>
And you walk up to the front of the tank .PERIOD Then you realize that these animals all have different personalities :COLON Some of them would hold their ground ,COMMA others would slink into the back of the tank and disappear in the rocks ,COMMA and one in particular ,COMMA this amazing animal .PERIOD <BREAK>
And what I learned in school though was really beneficial .PERIOD <BREAK>
If you're a wildlife filmmaker and you're going out into the field to film animals ,COMMA especially behavior ,COMMA it helps to have a fundamental background on who these animals are ,COMMA how they work and ,COMMA you know ,COMMA a bit about their behaviors .PERIOD <BREAK>
So we created a way to find out ,COMMA and I got my first look at that famous beak in action .PERIOD <BREAK>
And octopus are ,COMMA they live in all the oceans .PERIOD <BREAK>
And as you go deeper ,COMMA that lovely ,COMMA blue water you were launched in gives way to darker and darker blue .PERIOD <BREAK>
And finally ,COMMA it's a rich lavender ,COMMA and after a couple of thousand feet ,COMMA it's ink black .PERIOD <BREAK>
But we're just going to zip right past this area ,COMMA this area that includes about 95 percent of the living space on our planet and go to the mid-ocean ridge ,COMMA which I think is even more extraordinary .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the top of this mountain range is splitting apart ,COMMA creating a rift valley .PERIOD <BREAK>
The surrounding water is just a couple of degrees above freezing .PERIOD <BREAK>
And this kind of life and death of hydrothermal vent communities is going on every 30 or 40 years all along the ridge .PERIOD <BREAK>
But ,COMMA encouragingly ,COMMA I've seen just the opposite .PERIOD <BREAK>
Well ,COMMA how it happened is the local community galvanized .PERIOD <BREAK>
And these problems are so large and global ,COMMA and it's just overwhelming .PERIOD <BREAK>
My answer to that is don't look at the big ,COMMA overwhelming issues of the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we can make changes to our behavior that will influence and affect the environment ,COMMA like those people changed the health of that bay .PERIOD <BREAK>
I was afraid of womanhood .PERIOD <BREAK>
Not that I'm not afraid now ,COMMA but I've learned to pretend .PERIOD <BREAK>
I've learned to be flexible .PERIOD <BREAK>
Back in the ' 50 s and ' 60 s ,COMMA when I was growing up ,COMMA little girls were supposed to be kind and thoughtful and pretty and gentle and soft ,COMMA and we were supposed to fit into roles that were sort of shadowy -- really not quite clear what we were supposed to be .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now my mother was different .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I just ate it up .PERIOD <BREAK>
Because women are on the ground floor ,COMMA and we know the traditions so well ,COMMA we can bring a different voice to the table .PERIOD <BREAK>
And then also my family was in chaos ,COMMA and I drew to try to bring my family together -- -- try to bring my family together with laughter .PERIOD <BREAK>
But I feel blessed to be able to work with them .PERIOD <BREAK>
Two hundred years ago ,COMMA the United States was less than a few percent urbanized .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's now more than 82 percent .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now listen to this :COLON Every week for the foreseeable future ,COMMA until 2050 ,COMMA every week more than a million people are being added to our cities .PERIOD <BREAK>
However ,COMMA cities ,COMMA despite having this negative aspect to them ,COMMA are also the solution .PERIOD <BREAK>
So we have this kind of dual nature .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's the quest .PERIOD <BREAK>
So here's two questions that I have in my head when I think about this problem .PERIOD <BREAK>
We use them metaphorically -- the DNA of a company ,COMMA the metabolism of a city ,COMMA and so on -- is that just bullshit ,COMMA metaphorical bullshit ,COMMA or is there serious substance to it ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And if that is the case ,COMMA how come that it's very hard to kill a city ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
You could drop an atom bomb on a city ,COMMA and 30 years later it's surviving .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is just a tiny range actually :COLON It's us mammals ;SEMICOLON we're one of these .PERIOD <BREAK>
Rat ,COMMA that's a rat -- could have been you .PERIOD <BREAK>
We're all pretty much the same .PERIOD <BREAK>
And you see ,COMMA you're very familiar with this .PERIOD <BREAK>
Despite the fact that this is the most complex and diverse system in the universe ,COMMA there's an extraordinary simplicity being expressed by this .PERIOD <BREAK>
So a wonderful thing about all of biology is that it expresses an extraordinary economy of scale .PERIOD <BREAK>
And you're very familiar with these networks .PERIOD <BREAK>
And here's the summary of what I'm saying .PERIOD <BREAK>
Heart rates are slower ;SEMICOLON you live longer ;SEMICOLON diffusion of oxygen and resources across membranes is slower ,COMMA etc .PERIOD <BREAK>
Here it is ,COMMA which says that the bigger you are the more you have per capita ,COMMA unlike biology -- higher wages ,COMMA more super-creative people per capita as you get bigger ,COMMA more patents per capita ,COMMA more crime per capita .PERIOD <BREAK>
See companies ,COMMA they scale .PERIOD <BREAK>
There it is :COLON after some little fluctuations at the beginning ,COMMA when companies are innovating ,COMMA they scale beautifully .PERIOD <BREAK>
But you notice ,COMMA I've cheated ,COMMA because I've only gone up to ' 94 .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I put in front of them an authentic experience that allowed them to learn for themselves .PERIOD <BREAK>
The problem then becomes how do you take seventh- and eighth-graders to a talk about genocide and deal with the subject in a way that is responsible and respectful ,COMMA and they know what to do with it .PERIOD <BREAK>
I moved there primarily to be part of a learning environment that validated the way that I knew that kids learned ,COMMA and that really wanted to investigate what was possible when you are willing to let go of some of the paradigms of the past ,COMMA of information scarcity when my grandmother was in school and when my father was in school and even when I was in school ,COMMA and to a moment when we have information surplus .PERIOD <BREAK>
It asked them to create for themselves ,COMMA and it allowed them to fail ,COMMA process ,COMMA learn from .PERIOD <BREAK>
Ask them to go to places ,COMMA to see things for themselves ,COMMA to actually experience the learning ,COMMA to play ,COMMA to inquire .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is one of my favorite photos ,COMMA because this was taken on Tuesday ,COMMA when I asked the students to go to the polls .PERIOD <BREAK>
There are words that we're truly afraid of .PERIOD <BREAK>
This was an issue from 2002 that they published with a lot of different articles on the bionic human .PERIOD <BREAK>
Regenerative medicine is what Business Week put up when they did a story about regenerative medicine not too long ago .PERIOD <BREAK>
And you can basically see that the richer a country is ,COMMA the older the people are within it .PERIOD <BREAK>
And why is this a particularly dramatic challenge right now ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
In 2010 ,COMMA two workers per retiree in the US .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is age versus cost of health care .PERIOD <BREAK>
This video ,COMMA I think ,COMMA gets across the concept that I'm talking about quite dramatically .PERIOD <BREAK>
The way to do that is to develop a conversation with the body .PERIOD <BREAK>
In a child ,COMMA before the age of about six months ,COMMA if they lose their fingertip in an accident ,COMMA they'll re-grow their fingertip .PERIOD <BREAK>
We heard yesterday about the importance of new materials .PERIOD <BREAK>
I wouldn't be telling you this story if it weren't compelling .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is a horse .PERIOD The horse is not in pain .PERIOD <BREAK>
After treatment that's what it looks like .PERIOD <BREAK>
He chills the dish ,COMMA it changes its properties and he peels it right out of the dish .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's the coolest stuff .PERIOD <BREAK>
In this case ,COMMA at the end of the bypass operation ,COMMA you're going to see the stem cells from the patient that were removed at the beginning of the procedure being injected directly into the heart of the patient .PERIOD <BREAK>
This was a randomized trial .PERIOD <BREAK>
There go the cells .PERIOD <BREAK>
Here's another example of stem-cell therapy that isn't quite clinical yet ,COMMA but I think very soon will be .PERIOD <BREAK>
So you could go in ,COMMA you could get your tummy-tuck .PERIOD <BREAK>
Japan is the oldest country on earth in terms of its average age .PERIOD <BREAK>
In the United States we've had a somewhat different approach .PERIOD <BREAK>
But there's been no strategic investment to bring all of the necessary things to bear and focus them in a careful way .PERIOD <BREAK>
And these TEDsters are -- you know ,COMMA as innocent as that name sounds -- these are the philanthropists and artists and scientists who sort of shape our world .PERIOD <BREAK>
And what could I possibly have to say that would be distinguished enough to justify my participation in something like that ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Well my characters ,COMMA like the ones in my shows ,COMMA allow me to play with the spaces between those questions .PERIOD <BREAK>
What I should tell you -- what I should tell you is that they've each prepared their own little TED talks .PERIOD <BREAK>
Well you know ,COMMA she calls herself black -- she's really more like a caramel color if you look at her .PERIOD <BREAK>
Frankly ,COMMA I'm kvelling just to be here with all the luminaries you have attending something like this ,COMMA you know .PERIOD <BREAK>
So many others you see ,COMMA they're just wonderful .PERIOD <BREAK>
But anyway ,COMMA I should have started by saying just how lucky I feel .PERIOD <BREAK>
You know ,COMMA I couldn't have dreamed of such a thing as a young girl .PERIOD <BREAK>
You know ,COMMA your parents must be very proud .PERIOD <BREAK>
The point is ,COMMA I'm happy somebody has practical ideas to get us out of this mess .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA happy continued success .PERIOD <BREAK>
Sorry ,COMMA this is such a wonderful opportunity and everything ,COMMA to be here right now .PERIOD <BREAK>
My name is Noraida .PERIOD And I'm just -- I'm so thrilled to be part of like your TED conference that you're doing and everything like that .PERIOD <BREAK>
Actually ,COMMA you could say I grew up in the capital of Dominican Republic ,COMMA otherwise known as Washington Heights in New York City .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I think he's Mexican ,COMMA so that's -- honestly ,COMMA that's close enough for me right now .PERIOD So -- I just -- I'm sorry .PERIOD <BREAK>
Okay .PERIOD Sorry .PERIOD So anyway ,COMMA what I was trying to say is that I really love TED .PERIOD <BREAK>
Like ,COMMA it's -- I can't get over this right now .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA basically like DA BOMB -- what Dominican-American Benevolent Organization for Mothers and Babies does is ,COMMA basically ,COMMA we try to advocate for students who show a lot of academic promise and who also happen to be mothers like me .PERIOD <BREAK>
I come from a multicultural family .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we were only 11 years old ,COMMA so it was not appropriate .PERIOD <BREAK>
Although ,COMMA you know ,COMMA it was wonderful .PERIOD <BREAK>
Well ,COMMA I just wanted to quickly say good evening .PERIOD <BREAK>
But when Sarah Jones asked me to please come to TED ,COMMA I said ,COMMA well ,COMMA you know ,COMMA first ,COMMA I don't know that ,COMMA you know -- before two years ago ,COMMA you would not find me in front of an audience of people ,COMMA much less like this because I did not like to give speeches because I feel that ,COMMA as an immigrant ,COMMA I do not have good English skills for speaking .PERIOD <BREAK>
But that's where we had some problems .PERIOD <BREAK>
The daughter's marriage is very special to the mom .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I said ,COMMA Yes ,COMMA men can be difficult ,COMMA but all women have to get used to that .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA I always teach my kids to respect American ideas ,COMMA but I told my daughter that this is one exception -- -- that she is not gay ,COMMA she is just confused by this American problem .PERIOD <BREAK>
Thank you very ,COMMA very much .PERIOD I love you .PERIOD <BREAK>
Finished university education ,COMMA got a medical degree ,COMMA 1986 .PERIOD <BREAK>
But ,COMMA critical poverty :COLON this slide is from a presentation I gave not that long ago .PERIOD Gapminderorg tells the story of the gap between Africa and the rest of the world in terms of health care .PERIOD <BREAK>
Yes ,COMMA I'm sorry if it upsets some of you ,COMMA but I think you need to see this .PERIOD That's the floor ,COMMA OK ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Because it's scary and it's expensive ,COMMA but we need to have it ,COMMA OK ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
That's Mike ,COMMA Mike comes out from Mississippi .PERIOD <BREAK>
See ,COMMA that's one of the problems we have in Nigeria and in Africa generally .PERIOD <BREAK>
It looks like all these Americans are here and yes ,COMMA one Brit ,COMMA and he's not going to do anything -- he thinks he's British actually ,COMMA and he's actually Nigerian ,COMMA I just thought about that .PERIOD <BREAK>
We eventually got it working ,COMMA is the truth ,COMMA but it was one of these .PERIOD Even older than the one you saw .PERIOD <BREAK>
No ?QUESTIONMARK Yes ?QUESTIONMARK Doesn't matter ,COMMA it worked .PERIOD <BREAK>
And currently we're working on oxygen -- oxygen delivery on-site .PERIOD <BREAK>
So that's not new .PERIOD What we're doing is applying this technology to it .PERIOD <BREAK>
These are members of my graduating class ,COMMA 1986 .PERIOD <BREAK>
And finally ,COMMA I get a call last year ,COMMA and then I have to go up after JJ .PERIOD Abrams .PERIOD <BREAK>
Hollywood gathers around power tables ,COMMA and the Valley gathers around power tables .PERIOD <BREAK>
But I'm actually here today to tell a story .PERIOD <BREAK>
And what he said was ,COMMA he wasn't so much afraid that he might die ,COMMA but that he hadn't done the things that he wanted to with his life .PERIOD <BREAK>
But for me ,COMMA personally ,COMMA it was a real change .PERIOD <BREAK>
I went from living in a house with five guys in Palo Alto and living off their leftovers ,COMMA to all of a sudden having all kinds of resources .PERIOD <BREAK>
Connecting them together through conferences -- like a TED -- brings so many powerful connections ,COMMA or through the World Forum on Social Entrepreneurship that my foundation does at Oxford every year .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA in 2003 ,COMMA I started to make my way around Los Angeles to talk about the idea of a pro-social media company and I was met with a lot of encouragement .PERIOD <BREAK>
One of the lines of encouragement that I heard over and over was ,COMMA The streets of Hollywood are littered with the carcasses of people like you ,COMMA who think you're going to come to this town and make movies .PERIOD <BREAK>
One of these films in particular ,COMMA called North Country ,COMMA was actually kind of a box office disaster .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that to me ,COMMA spoke volumes ,COMMA because it's -- the film started about a true-life story about a woman who was harassed ,COMMA sued her employer ,COMMA led to a landmark case that led to the Equal Opportunity Act ,COMMA and the Violence Against Women Act and others .PERIOD <BREAK>
At that point ,COMMA I thought I knew something about global warming .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we have 10 films in production right now ,COMMA and dozens others in development .PERIOD <BREAK>
And one thing that I've learned is that there's never one right way to make change .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I can imagine ,COMMA if we do this ,COMMA the headlines in 10 years might read something like these :COLON New AIDS Cases in Africa Fall to Zero ,COMMA US .PERIOD Imports its Last Barrel of Oil -- -- Israelis and Palestinians Celebrate 10 Years of Peaceful Coexistence .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I believe that ,COMMA working together ,COMMA we can make all of these things happen .PERIOD <BREAK>
The next day ,COMMA all the artists were invited to join Mandela in Robben Island ,COMMA where he was going to give a conference to the world's press ,COMMA standing in front of his former prison cell .PERIOD <BREAK>
He was wearing a t-shirt like the one I wear now .PERIOD <BREAK>
I've subsequently become an envoy for Scotland and HIV .PERIOD <BREAK>
I tell her story to everyone because she represents one of millions of HIV/AIDS orphans .PERIOD <BREAK>
I think that's fair to say ,COMMA it's almost everyone in the hall .PERIOD <BREAK>
But now we have this new layer of private sovereignty in cyberspace .PERIOD <BREAK>
And their decisions about software coding ,COMMA engineering ,COMMA design ,COMMA terms of service all act as a kind of law that shapes what we can and cannot do with our digital lives .PERIOD <BREAK>
The reality is that even in democratic societies today ,COMMA we do not have good answers for how you balance the need for security and law enforcement on one hand and protection of civil liberties and free speech on the other in our digital networks .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is a map of social networks worldwide ,COMMA and certainly Facebook has conquered much of the world -- which is either a good or a bad thing ,COMMA depending on how you like the way Facebook manages its service .PERIOD <BREAK>
In plain English ,COMMA that means censorship and surveillance of their users .PERIOD <BREAK>
This has a chilling effect on people's ability to use the Internet to hold government accountable .PERIOD <BREAK>
Thank you very much .PERIOD <BREAK>
Comparable ,COMMA in its own very peculiar way ,COMMA to the achievements of Microsoft or Google .PERIOD <BREAK>
Here are some of those same weightlifters after their 1989 makeover .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so I resolved to travel around the world examining this global criminal underworld by talking to policemen ,COMMA by talking to victims ,COMMA by talking to consumers of illicit goods and services .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA organized crime in a globalizing world operates in the same way as any other business .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it is this Western desire to consume that is the primary driver of international organized crime .PERIOD <BREAK>
And as a consequence of this trade ,COMMA Britain alone lost eight billion dollars in revenue .PERIOD <BREAK>
So what were these guys doing with all the money they were making ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Well ,COMMA this is where we come to globalization ,COMMA because that was not just the deregulation of global trade .PERIOD <BREAK>
This one ,COMMA however ,COMMA is in central British Columbia where I photographed it .PERIOD <BREAK>
What they've done is they've shifted their operations .PERIOD <BREAK>
People don't smoke as much dope ,COMMA or visit prostitutes quite so frequently during a recession .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so as soon as I saw this drop into my inbox ,COMMA I dispatched it hastily to the recycle bin and spared myself a very nasty infection .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's such a large conference .PERIOD <BREAK>
Mark Serfaas .PERIOD It's pretty cool ,COMMA huh ?QUESTIONMARK Pursuing happiness .PERIOD <BREAK>
I mean -- no ,COMMA I mean like in the TED sense ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
1860 -- am I good ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and my name ,COMMA and it would tell me .PERIOD And I have to tell you ,COMMA right now ,COMMA this is an unadulterated piece of software ,COMMA this is a real Internet browser and this is an actual Google site ,COMMA and we're going to test it out live today .PERIOD <BREAK>
Am I feeling lucky ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Ze Frank :COLON Oh .PERIOD Amazing .PERIOD <BREAK>
Needless to say ,COMMA I was able to leave my job .PERIOD <BREAK>
Four years later ,COMMA I still get probably two or three hundred emails a day from people I don't know ,COMMA and it's been an amazing opportunity to kind of get to know different cultures ,COMMA you know ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And that was embarrassing .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA the Scribbler is an attempt to create a generative tool .PERIOD <BREAK>
I mean this is incredible .PERIOD This is an 11 -year-old girl -- drew this and submitted it .PERIOD It's just gorgeous .PERIOD <BREAK>
None of the haikus were written by the same person ,COMMA and in fact ,COMMA no line was -- you know ,COMMA each line is contributed by a different person at a different -- at a different time .PERIOD <BREAK>
It dances to music .PERIOD Lotte Reiniger ,COMMA an amazing shadow puppeteer in the ' 20 s ,COMMA that started doing more elaborate things .PERIOD <BREAK>
Chris Anderson :COLON Ladies and gentlemen ,COMMA Mr .PERIOD Ze Frank .PERIOD <BREAK>
Well ,COMMA this is 2009 .PERIOD <BREAK>
So I'm going to talk about it .PERIOD <BREAK>
We get the geneticists keeping on telling us how extremely closely we are related -- hardly any genes of difference ,COMMA very ,COMMA very closely related .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'm not talking about airy-fairy stuff about culture or psychology ,COMMA or behavior .PERIOD <BREAK>
Professor Tobias came over from South Africa and spoke to University College London .PERIOD <BREAK>
You've believed it through generations .PERIOD <BREAK>
So that is what they have done now .PERIOD <BREAK>
Aaron Filler from Harvard said ,COMMA Isn't it time we stopped talking about selective pressures ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
He kept it to himself for 30 years .PERIOD <BREAK>
And at that time ,COMMA it became set in stone :COLON the aquatic theory should be dumped with the UFOs and the yetis ,COMMA as part of the lunatic fringe of science .PERIOD <BREAK>
I suggested it and people said ,COMMA No no no .PERIOD <BREAK>
Peals of merry laughter !EXCLAMATIONMARK <BREAK>
That crazy woman .PERIOD She's off again .PERIOD She'll say anything won't she ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
This has come 'round to be that all those naked pachyderms have aquatic ancestors .PERIOD <BREAK>
So this is a close connection between nakedness and water .PERIOD <BREAK>
Here you can't find anybody to compare it with ,COMMA because we're the only animal that walks upright on two legs .PERIOD <BREAK>
There is only one circumstance in which they always ,COMMA all of them ,COMMA walk on two legs ,COMMA and that is when they are wading through water .PERIOD <BREAK>
David Attenborough thinks it's significant ,COMMA as the possible beginning of our bipedalism .PERIOD <BREAK>
In the whale it's complete :COLON no fat inside at all ,COMMA all in blubber outside .PERIOD <BREAK>
We can speak .PERIOD <BREAK>
Try to imagine a gorilla performing the same maneuver ,COMMA and you can see that ,COMMA compared with gorilla ,COMMA we are halfway to being shaped like a fish .PERIOD <BREAK>
There is nothing there .PERIOD <BREAK>
I don't believe it .PERIOD <BREAK>
There was Professor Tobias .PERIOD He's come over .PERIOD <BREAK>
Daniel Dennett ,COMMA he's come over .PERIOD <BREAK>
So the third thing that might happen is a very beautiful thing .PERIOD <BREAK>
I can tell you that in three words .PERIOD <BREAK>
The textbooks don't mention it .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it's pretty simple .PERIOD <BREAK>
Everybody's got one -- all of you .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so when working as an interaction designer ,COMMA or as an artist who deals with participation -- creating things that live on ,COMMA in or around the human form -- it's really a powerful space to work within .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it is a tool that actually enables one to listen to their own innards .PERIOD <BREAK>
When I meet a glacier for the very first time ,COMMA what do I do ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Do I carve a message in the snow ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
But really the most satisfying experience I've had is the act of listening ,COMMA which is what we need in any good relationship .PERIOD <BREAK>
And just as with the wall ,COMMA how I wanted to be more wall-like ,COMMA with this project ,COMMA I'd actually like to take more a of glacial pace .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA how do you do that ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
That doesn't move .PERIOD <BREAK>
Here's my promise to you :COLON If you are consistent and do this ,COMMA within three months the elected official will start calling you when that issue comes up and say ,COMMA What do you think ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA when you approach these animals ,COMMA you need to understand there's a dangerous end to them ,COMMA and you also need to approach them with some level of respect and a little bit of wariness .PERIOD <BREAK>
If you had the right information ,COMMA you would have done the right thing .PERIOD <BREAK>
If they follow protocol ,COMMA they'll pick up the phone and say ,COMMA Hey ,COMMA do you have the original ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And you actually get into the folder that the elected official actually has to read .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA what your letter means :COLON I've got to tell you ,COMMA we are all in a party ,COMMA and political officials are the pinatas .PERIOD <BREAK>
Living systems are in constant conversation with the natural world ,COMMA through sets of chemical reactions called metabolism .PERIOD <BREAK>
And this is the conversion of one group of substances into another ,COMMA either through the production or the absorption of energy .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA that's exactly the kind of process that I'm interested in ,COMMA when we're thinking about sustainable materials .PERIOD <BREAK>
It is able to move around its environment .PERIOD <BREAK>
It can follow chemical gradients .PERIOD <BREAK>
It can undergo complex reactions ,COMMA some of which are happily architectural .PERIOD <BREAK>
Here ,COMMA this is a protocell ,COMMA and it's vigorously shedding this skin .PERIOD <BREAK>
The protocells can actually move away from the light .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA this is really interesting .PERIOD Now we have an architecture that connects a city to the natural world in a very direct and immediate way .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is a river .PERIOD <BREAK>
The reasons vary state to state ,COMMA but mostly in the details .PERIOD <BREAK>
But as more people showed up wanting water ,COMMA the folks who were there first got a little concerned ,COMMA and in 1865 ,COMMA Montana passed its first water law .PERIOD <BREAK>
There's another thing happening around the country ,COMMA which is that companies are starting to get concerned about their water footprint .PERIOD <BREAK>
So what can they do about this remaining water footprint that can have serious effects on the ecosystem ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
He doesn't lose the water right ,COMMA he just chooses to apply that right ,COMMA or some portion of it ,COMMA to the stream ,COMMA instead of to the land .PERIOD <BREAK>
This guy's measuring the water that this leaves in the stream .PERIOD <BREAK>
He's by far the happiest man ever measured by science .PERIOD <BREAK>
Compassion is fun .PERIOD <BREAK>
Therefore ,COMMA to create the conditions for global compassion ,COMMA all we have to do is to reframe compassion as something that is fun .PERIOD <BREAK>
These are leaders who are highly ambitious for the greater good .PERIOD <BREAK>
And they ,COMMA according to the research ,COMMA make the best business leaders .PERIOD <BREAK>
And if you look at these qualities in the context of compassion ,COMMA we find that the cognitive and affective components of compassion -- understanding people and empathizing with people -- inhibits ,COMMA tones down ,COMMA what I call the excessive self-obsession that's in us ,COMMA therefore creating the conditions for humility .PERIOD <BREAK>
This awareness of serving the greater good is very self-inspiring and it creates fertile ground for compassion to grow in .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's one .PERIOD <BREAK>
The second ingredient is autonomy .PERIOD <BREAK>
And this also creates the conditions for compassion in the workplace .PERIOD <BREAK>
I found this to be true ,COMMA both on the individual level and at a corporate level .PERIOD <BREAK>
And what I recognized was that there was an incredible window of opportunity for us as a world community to come together and end torture as an investigative tool .PERIOD <BREAK>
We often think of torture as being political torture or reserved for just the worst ,COMMA but ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA 95 percent of torture today is not for political prisoners .PERIOD <BREAK>
So it's just a place where there was no rule of law .PERIOD <BREAK>
In Burundi I walked into a prison and it wasn't a 12 -year-old boy ,COMMA it was an 8 -year-old boy for stealing a mobile phone .PERIOD <BREAK>
And when I walked up to the prison director ,COMMA I said ,COMMA You've got to let her out .PERIOD <BREAK>
So the pieces are ,COMMA not only the training of the lawyers ,COMMA but us finding a way to systematically implement early access to counsel ,COMMA because they are the safeguard in the system for people who are being tortured .PERIOD <BREAK>
But the third and most important thing is that we make a commitment to this .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the reason that I think that those words are interesting is because those were the same kinds of words that were used for people who decided they would end slavery ,COMMA or end apartheid .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA you know ,COMMA there's bars .PERIOD And by the time that Vishna was getting bigger ,COMMA which means what gets bigger ?QUESTIONMARK Your head gets bigger .PERIOD <BREAK>
So he would come to the first bar ,COMMA the second bar and then the third bar ,COMMA and then really slowly move his head so he could fit through ,COMMA and come back ,COMMA third ,COMMA second ,COMMA first .PERIOD And he would grab my pinkie ,COMMA because what he wanted to do every day is he wanted to go visit .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I will do the one thing that I can do .PERIOD <BREAK>
Thank you .PERIOD <BREAK>
We were in Queens ,COMMA we were building the big ,COMMA big ,COMMA big ,COMMA big building in Midtown ,COMMA so we were in the small ,COMMA small ,COMMA small boondocks .PERIOD <BREAK>
But it's not only that .PERIOD <BREAK>
In Italy ,COMMA in Milan especially ,COMMA contemporary art really doesn't have that much of a place .PERIOD <BREAK>
They tried to make a toddler's gas mask in such a way that the toddler can be held by the parent because proximity of the body is so important .PERIOD <BREAK>
Instead ,COMMA she said ,COMMA No ,COMMA no .PERIOD Work and leisure can be together .PERIOD <BREAK>
Yeah ,COMMA that's particularly gorgeous -- it's the TV dinner of 2001 .PERIOD <BREAK>
I would like ,COMMA instead ,COMMA to talk about how great some designers are .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's a long story because it started before 2001 and it was called Emergency .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA designers sometimes don't do things that are immediately functional ,COMMA but they're functional to our understanding of issues .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is Cindy van den Bremen ,COMMA who is a Dutch designer that's done this series of Capsters .PERIOD <BREAK>
They range from this fluffy toy that is about hugging you -- because autistic children like to be hugged tight ,COMMA so it has a spring inside -- all the way to this doll with a mirror so the child can see him or herself in the mirror and regain a sense of self .PERIOD <BREAK>
Design really looks upon the whole world and it considers the world in all of its different ranges .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it was really interesting because I was the last speaker and before me there were people that were really talking about luxury ,COMMA and I didn't want to be a party pooper but at the same time I felt that I had to kind of bring back the discourse to reality .PERIOD <BREAK>
The rhythm of the sinusoids has changed tremendously ,COMMA just like the rhythm of our life in the past 25 years ,COMMA so I'm not sure anymore what the wavelength is .PERIOD <BREAK>
But design and science and the possibility of visualizing different scales ,COMMA and therefore ,COMMA really work at the scale of the very small to make it very big and very meaningful .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA Africa is a complex continent full of contradictions ,COMMA as you can see .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I want to tell you that this is my story ,COMMA OK ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And it's the story of many of the Africans who are here .PERIOD <BREAK>
And my father said ,COMMA OK ,COMMA listen .PERIOD <BREAK>
So we went to the school ,COMMA and because we were nobodies ,COMMA and because we didn't have privilege ,COMMA and because my father didn't have the right last name ,COMMA he was treated like dirt .PERIOD <BREAK>
But the money ran out .PERIOD <BREAK>
You don't see the blogger ,COMMA you don't see the Harvard-educated lawyer ,COMMA the vibrant person ,COMMA you know ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And you didn't know about the windmill ,COMMA you know ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And I was just moved .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA what is to be done ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And this is an example ,COMMA you know ,COMMA blogging is one way of doing that .PERIOD <BREAK>
So we need to start getting better .PERIOD <BREAK>
And going back to the point I was trying to make ,COMMA this is the Swahili Wikipedia .PERIOD <BREAK>
Swahili is spoken by about 50 million people in East Africa .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA that's a start ,COMMA and we've heard of all their other initiatives .PERIOD <BREAK>
I walked away from a job with one of the top firms in DC ,COMMA Covington and Burling ,COMMA six figures .PERIOD <BREAK>
What are they doing ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Practically .PERIOD I mean ,COMMA when I was a first-year student in law school ,COMMA my mom's business had collapsed ,COMMA so I was supporting her .PERIOD <BREAK>
My sister was struggling to get through undergrad .PERIOD <BREAK>
An example .PERIOD This man changed my life .PERIOD <BREAK>
I said ,COMMA I want to be a lawyer .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I'm like ,COMMA Because I'm here and it's cheap ,COMMA and you know ,COMMA I kind of like Pittsburgh .PERIOD <BREAK>
I was also building something called the Copenhagen Wheel ,COMMA which is just a really beautiful ,COMMA beautiful electric bike at a lab at MIT called SENSEable City Lab .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is a place where my friend ,COMMA Abhishek Sen was interning .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that's his actual photograph .PERIOD <BREAK>
She told me that this is how you would typically test for anemia .PERIOD <BREAK>
But this is not available in Parol .PERIOD <BREAK>
But fundamentally ,COMMA what I believe is that the map behind of me is called basically the map of anemia .PERIOD <BREAK>
And when I walked in ,COMMA she was already at the table .PERIOD <BREAK>
And she said ,COMMA I saw your Talk live-streamed .PERIOD <BREAK>
So of course ,COMMA the only thing I could think of to say at that point was ,COMMA Yeah ,COMMA me neither .PERIOD <BREAK>
Why did you bring this up ?QUESTIONMARK Have you lost your mind ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And I said ,COMMA I'm just thinking about it a little bit .PERIOD <BREAK>
And my life did end when that happened .PERIOD <BREAK>
The first is vulnerability is not weakness .PERIOD <BREAK>
The majority of people .PERIOD <BREAK>
I define vulnerability as emotional risk ,COMMA exposure ,COMMA uncertainty .PERIOD <BREAK>
I am not a natural vulnerability researcher .PERIOD <BREAK>
So when I became Vulnerability TED ,COMMA like an action figure -- like Ninja Barbie ,COMMA but I'm Vulnerability TED -- I thought ,COMMA I'm going to leave that shame stuff behind ,COMMA because I spent six years studying shame before I really started writing and talking about vulnerability .PERIOD <BREAK>
But in surviving this last year ,COMMA I was reminded of a cardinal rule -- not a research rule ,COMMA but a moral imperative from my upbringing -- you've got to dance with the one who brung ya .PERIOD <BREAK>
It is to put on some galoshes and walk through and find our way around .PERIOD <BREAK>
Here's why .PERIOD <BREAK>
I can't wait to tell people this .PERIOD <BREAK>
The credit goes to the man in the arena whose face is marred with dust and blood and sweat .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's what life is about ,COMMA about daring greatly ,COMMA about being in the arena .PERIOD <BREAK>
I know your dad never paid attention ,COMMA even when you made CFO .PERIOD <BREAK>
Shame drives two big tapes -- never good enough and ,COMMA if you can talk it out of that one ,COMMA who do you think you are ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
It's uncomfortable ,COMMA but it's adaptive .PERIOD <BREAK>
I did not interview men for the first four years of my study .PERIOD <BREAK>
And he said ,COMMA That's convenient .PERIOD <BREAK>
So I started interviewing men and asking questions .PERIOD <BREAK>
If you put shame in a Petri dish ,COMMA it needs three things to grow exponentially :COLON secrecy ,COMMA silence and judgment .PERIOD <BREAK>
If you put the same amount of shame in a Petri dish and douse it with empathy ,COMMA it can't survive .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I know it's seductive to stand outside the arena ,COMMA because I think I did it my whole life ,COMMA and think to myself ,COMMA I'm going to go in there and kick some ass when I'm bulletproof and when I'm perfect .PERIOD <BREAK>
We want you to go in .PERIOD <BREAK>
So what would be better [than] to use the Herring Gull ,COMMA in its freedom ,COMMA circling and swooping over the sea ,COMMA and [to] use this as a role model ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
So maybe we'll try it once -- to fly a SmartBird .PERIOD <BREAK>
We have to turn it ,COMMA go up and go down .PERIOD <BREAK>
Bruno Giussani :COLON Markus ,COMMA I think that we should fly it once more .PERIOD <BREAK>
I think first it's important for us to recognize what it is to be blind .PERIOD <BREAK>
Today ,COMMA we're reaching not even 10 percent of them .PERIOD <BREAK>
He had to mortgage all his life savings to make a bank loan .PERIOD <BREAK>
It is ourselves we are healing .PERIOD <BREAK>
This helped us build a very ethical and very highly patient-centric organization and systems that support it .PERIOD <BREAK>
So what is in this video is a surgeon operating ,COMMA and then you see on the other side ,COMMA another patient is getting ready .PERIOD <BREAK>
And ,COMMA of course ,COMMA one needs the mindset to be wanting to give away what you have as a surplus .PERIOD <BREAK>
And what we did was a couple of very counter-intuitive things .PERIOD <BREAK>
And then ,COMMA over time ,COMMA we were able to bring down the cost significantly to about two percent of what it used to be when we started out .PERIOD <BREAK>
So we're really comparing apples to apples .PERIOD <BREAK>
So I want to end my talk leaving this thought and challenge to you .PERIOD <BREAK>
Dr .PERIOD V :COLON When you grow in spiritual consciousness ,COMMA we identify with all that is in the world so there is no exploitation .PERIOD <BREAK>
So the question is :COLON how do we get the stuff over from the digital into the physical ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Let me show you the weight-shifting mobile .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA mass is the first thing ;SEMICOLON the second thing ,COMMA that's shape .PERIOD <BREAK>
Again ,COMMA it's a mobile phone-shaped box ,COMMA and this one can change its shape .PERIOD <BREAK>
As humans ,COMMA we are social ,COMMA we are empathic ,COMMA and that's great .PERIOD <BREAK>
So ,COMMA that's very intuitive ,COMMA and that's what we want .PERIOD <BREAK>
The Brown administration ,COMMA and a bunch of my friends ,COMMA basically leveled the energy efficiency of California ,COMMA so it's the same now ,COMMA 30 years later ,COMMA even though our economy has gone up 80 percent ,COMMA per capita .PERIOD <BREAK>
The dominant demographic event of our time is this screamingly rapid urbanization that we have going on .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's interesting ,COMMA because history is driven to a large degree by the size of cities .PERIOD <BREAK>
People are following opportunity into town .PERIOD <BREAK>
It is not the case that slums undermine prosperity ,COMMA not the working slums ;SEMICOLON they help create prosperity .PERIOD <BREAK>
These people are valuable as a group .PERIOD <BREAK>
You look at that lane on the right .PERIOD <BREAK>
They're doing it through an outlaw thing ,COMMA the informal economy .PERIOD <BREAK>
And young people in brand new cities they're inventing ,COMMA doing new things ,COMMA in the south .PERIOD <BREAK>
Climate is a profoundly complex ,COMMA nonlinear system ,COMMA full of runaway positive feedbacks ,COMMA hidden thresholds and irrevocable tipping points .PERIOD <BREAK>
We're going to keep being surprised .PERIOD And almost all the surprises are going to be bad ones .PERIOD <BREAK>
If all of the electricity you used in your lifetime was nuclear ,COMMA the amount of waste that would be added up would fit in a Coke can .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's interesting ,COMMA say ,COMMA to take a 25 -megawatt ,COMMA 25 million watts ,COMMA and you compare it to the standard big iron of an ordinary Westinghouse or Ariva ,COMMA which is 12 ,COMMA 16 billion watts .PERIOD <BREAK>
These things are way smaller .PERIOD They're much more adaptable .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is a list of them .PERIOD <BREAK>
And as those events keep happening we're going to say ,COMMA Okay ,COMMA what can we do about that really ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Here is an example that climatologists like a lot ,COMMA one of the dozens of geoengineering ideas .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now this shouldn't come as a surprise to us .PERIOD <BREAK>
As with BP ,COMMA the hole does get plugged ,COMMA at least temporarily ,COMMA but not before exacting a tremendous price .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now both of these options -- the boy genius and the scammer -- are going to make you vastly overconfident and therefore more prone to taking even bigger risks in the future .PERIOD <BREAK>
The Gulf of Mexico is a very big ocean .PERIOD <BREAK>
In other words ,COMMA the ocean is big ;SEMICOLON she can take it .PERIOD <BREAK>
A new bubble will replace the old one .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now looking at these images ,COMMA it's difficult to grasp the scale of this operation ,COMMA which can already be seen from space and could grow to an area the size of England .PERIOD <BREAK>

Will someone please throw a small farm animal up onto the stage ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Where's Gloria ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Yeah ,COMMA a little sketchy .PERIOD <BREAK>
What do you want me to do with it ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Nice .PERIOD <BREAK>

You are my hero .PERIOD You're my Jim Shea ,COMMA Jr .PERIOD <BREAK>

If someday I can achieve something ,COMMA I would like to say thank you daddy and mommy .PERIOD <BREAK>
If I do like you ,COMMA I give you one cow and many other things and we become friends .PERIOD <BREAK>
YAB :COLON You can also go to the website ,COMMA answer -- respond to the questions also .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now I am going to speak to you about my movie .PERIOD <BREAK>
Video :COLON This Earth is four and a half billion years old .PERIOD <BREAK>
There is no business on this movie .PERIOD <BREAK>
Merci beaucoup .PERIOD I love you .PERIOD <BREAK>
Well we have a whole OR .PERIOD team ,COMMA general anesthesia ,COMMA nurses ,COMMA and another doctor across from me .PERIOD <BREAK>
There will be two passes here ,COMMA in the same patient ,COMMA from the same hole .PERIOD <BREAK>
This was done under local anesthesia ,COMMA as an outpatient .PERIOD <BREAK>
In the last decade there's been an explosion of use of bone marrow stem cells to treat the patient's other diseases such as heart disease ,COMMA vascular disease ,COMMA orthopedics ,COMMA tissue engineering ,COMMA even in neurology to treat Parkinson's and diabetes .PERIOD <BREAK>
We've just come out ,COMMA we're commercializing ,COMMA this year ,COMMA generation 20 of the Marrow Miner .PERIOD <BREAK>
That was all done on a machine that looks like this .PERIOD <BREAK>
So now what we do is we take a genome ,COMMA we make maybe 50 copies of it ,COMMA we cut all those copies up into little 50 -base reads ,COMMA and then we sequence them ,COMMA massively parallel .PERIOD <BREAK>
And he sequenced ,COMMA he took skin cells ,COMMA healthy skin ,COMMA and cancerous bone marrow ,COMMA and he sequenced the whole genomes of both of them in a couple of weeks ,COMMA no big deal .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so they were given L-Dopa ,COMMA and their symptoms did improve ,COMMA but they weren't totally asymptomatic .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so what he did was he got his kids sequenced .PERIOD <BREAK>
Thankfully ,COMMA I was able to answer A ,COMMA and I say that honestly in case my life insurance agent is listening .PERIOD <BREAK>
Not hard to imagine .PERIOD My company has software that does this right now .PERIOD <BREAK>
It can be summed up in a single sentence :COLON Everything that can happen ,COMMA does .PERIOD <BREAK>
And things can happen only if these interactions are perfectly balanced .PERIOD <BREAK>
All of these matter particles come in left- and right-handed varieties ,COMMA and have anti-particle partners that carry opposite charges .PERIOD <BREAK>
These matter particles all interact with the various force particles .PERIOD <BREAK>
The most important thing to understand here is that there's a different kind of charge associated with each of these forces .PERIOD <BREAK>
A particle that hasn't been seen yet ,COMMA but we're pretty sure exists ,COMMA is the Higgs particle ,COMMA which gives masses to all these other particles .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it seems strange that nature would have so many elementary particles .PERIOD <BREAK>
The most familiar charge is electric charge .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA it turns out the electric charge is actually a combination of two other charges :COLON hypercharge and weak charge .PERIOD <BREAK>
For example ,COMMA this weak force particle and its anti-particle can be created in a collision .PERIOD <BREAK>
One of the weak particles could decay into an electron and an anti-neutrino ,COMMA and these three still add to zero total charge .PERIOD <BREAK>
So there's an old idea in particle physics that this known pattern of charges ,COMMA which is not very symmetric ,COMMA could emerge from a more perfect pattern that gets broken -- similar to how the Higgs particle breaks the electroweak pattern to give electromagnetism .PERIOD <BREAK>
This particular choice corresponds to a grand unified theory introduced by Pati and Salam in 1973 .PERIOD <BREAK>
The larger pattern allows us to predict the existence of particles that have never been seen .PERIOD <BREAK>
These particles are not uniquely identified by their six charges .PERIOD <BREAK>
Each point in this pattern corresponds to a symmetry of this very complex and beautiful shape .PERIOD <BREAK>
And this idea that nature is described by mathematics is not at all new .PERIOD <BREAK>
In 1623 ,COMMA Galileo wrote this :COLON Nature's grand book ,COMMA which stands continually open to our gaze ,COMMA is written in the language of mathematics .PERIOD <BREAK>
And ,COMMA of course ,COMMA bad for me personally .PERIOD <BREAK>
In this regard ,COMMA new physics theories are a lot like start-up companies .PERIOD <BREAK>
As with any large investment ,COMMA it can be emotionally difficult to abandon a line of research when it isn't working out .PERIOD <BREAK>
I try to balance my life equally between physics ,COMMA love and surfing -- my own three charge directions .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that shape has remarkable similarities -- and the way it fits into this E 8 pattern could be the rest of the picture .PERIOD <BREAK>
They are more like us than any other living creature ,COMMA and we've heard about that during this TED Conference .PERIOD <BREAK>
Chimpanzees ,COMMA I believe ,COMMA more than any other living creature ,COMMA have helped us to understand that ,COMMA after all ,COMMA there is no sharp line between humans and the rest of the animal kingdom .PERIOD <BREAK>
There isn't time to go into it ,COMMA but it's including things like tree nurseries ,COMMA methods of farming most suitable to this now very degraded ,COMMA almost desert-like land up in these mountains .PERIOD <BREAK>
Ways of reclaiming overused farmland ,COMMA so that within two years they can again be productive .PERIOD <BREAK>
Perhaps build some schoolrooms .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we've got ,COMMA as is the case around the world ,COMMA about 95 percent of all loans returned .PERIOD <BREAK>
And as a result of this program ,COMMA something's happening for conservation .PERIOD <BREAK>
What's happening for conservation is that the farmers living in these 24 villages ,COMMA instead of looking on us as a bunch of white people coming to study a whole bunch of monkeys -- and by the way ,COMMA many of the staff are now Tanzanian -- but when we began the TACARE program ,COMMA it was a Tanzanian team going into the villages .PERIOD <BREAK>
And everywhere there were these terrible problems .PERIOD <BREAK>
And you know the kind I'm talking about .PERIOD I'm talking about pollution .PERIOD <BREAK>
The water -- water is perhaps one of the most crucial issues that we're going to face in this century -- and everywhere water is being polluted by agricultural ,COMMA industrial and household chemicals that still are being sprayed around the world ,COMMA seemingly with the inability to profit from past experience .PERIOD <BREAK>
In many parts of sub-Saharan Africa ,COMMA the droughts are so much worse .PERIOD <BREAK>
Well ,COMMA do you think there could be some kind of disconnect between this extraordinarily clever brain ,COMMA the kind of brain that the TED technologies exemplify ,COMMA and the human heart ?QUESTIONMARK Talking about it in the non-scientific term ,COMMA in terms of love and compassion .PERIOD Is there some disconnect ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
We have compromised their future .PERIOD <BREAK>
Hundreds and thousands of young people around the world can break through and can make this a better world for all living things .PERIOD <BREAK>
One of their projects will be to help animals -- not just wildlife ,COMMA domestic animals as well .PERIOD <BREAK>
You can't come to a conference like TED and not have hope ,COMMA can you ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And I mean ,COMMA think of the technologies .PERIOD <BREAK>
How many of us have children or grandchildren ,COMMA nieces ,COMMA nephews ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
People like this are so inspirational .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I hope that some of us can get together and talk about some of these things ,COMMA especially the Roots and Shoots program .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it was very ,COMMA very exciting for me to meet her and see just one example of how young people ,COMMA when they are empowered ,COMMA given the opportunity to take action ,COMMA to make the world a better place ,COMMA truly are our hope for tomorrow .PERIOD <BREAK>
But other than letting some of you live out your fantasy of looking as cool as Tom Cruise in Minority Report ,COMMA the reason why we're really excited about this device is that it really can act as one of these sixth-sense devices that gives you relevant information about whatever is in front of you .PERIOD <BREAK>
You can get video annotations of the event that you're reading about You can get the latest sports scores etc .PERIOD <BREAK>
I then ,COMMA in the last few years ,COMMA learned about the Pacific garbage patch and the gyre .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the bigger picture is :COLON we need to find a way to turn off the faucet .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's not just that gyre of plastic that I'm concerned about -- it's the gyre of plastic in the supermarket .PERIOD <BREAK>
You put something in a bin and you don't have to think about it again .PERIOD <BREAK>
And I'm sure you'll feel that it's from a safe source .PERIOD <BREAK>
But what if it wasn't ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
The smallest bacteria is about 200 nanometers .PERIOD <BREAK>
But I got to thinking ,COMMA you know ,COMMA if we were in the middle of a flood zone in Bangladesh ,COMMA the water wouldn't look like this .PERIOD <BREAK>
There we go .PERIOD Mind the electrics .PERIOD <BREAK>
Pop the cartridge out .PERIOD Pop a new one in .PERIOD <BREAK>
About half a cent a day to run .PERIOD <BREAK>
To put that into context ,COMMA The UK .PERIOD government spends about 12 billion pounds a year on foreign aid .PERIOD <BREAK>
Phyllis Rodriguez :COLON We are here today because of the fact that we have what most people consider an unusual friendship .PERIOD <BREAK>
And yet ,COMMA it feels natural to us now .PERIOD <BREAK>
And when I saw it -- and yet ,COMMA through the shock ,COMMA the terrible shock ,COMMA and the terrible explosion in our lives ,COMMA literally ,COMMA we were not vengeful .PERIOD <BREAK>
I am the mother of Zacarias Moussaoui .PERIOD <BREAK>
My son ,COMMA I don't know where he is .PERIOD <BREAK>
So that's why I decided to tell my story ,COMMA so that my suffering is something positive for other women .PERIOD <BREAK>
We must be hand-in-hand and do something together .PERIOD <BREAK>
So if I can save one of the young girls ,COMMA and avoid that they get married and suffer as much as I did ,COMMA well this is something good .PERIOD <BREAK>
I would like to say that I have learned so much from Aicha ,COMMA starting with that day we had our very first meeting with other family members -- which was a very private meeting with security ,COMMA because it was November 2002 ,COMMA and ,COMMA frankly ,COMMA we were afraid of the super-patriotism of that time in the country -- those of us family members .PERIOD <BREAK>
Why did we want to meet her ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And what happened then is we all told our stories ,COMMA and we all connected as human beings .PERIOD <BREAK>
I never had met someone with such a hard life ,COMMA from such a totally different culture and environment from my own .PERIOD <BREAK>
And these are always periods ,COMMA ladies and gentlemen ,COMMA accompanied by turbulence ,COMMA and all too often by blood .PERIOD <BREAK>
For power is not just moving laterally from nation to nation .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's also moving vertically .PERIOD <BREAK>
My guess is ,COMMA for what it's worth ,COMMA is that the United States will remain the most powerful nation on earth for the next 10 years ,COMMA 15 ,COMMA but the context in which she holds her power has now radically altered ;SEMICOLON it has radically changed .PERIOD <BREAK>
But that's not a usual case in history .PERIOD <BREAK>
A fixed polarity of power means fixed alliances .PERIOD <BREAK>
Canning ,COMMA the great British foreign secretary once said ,COMMA Britain has a common interest ,COMMA but no common allies .PERIOD <BREAK>
At that time ,COMMA the defense of my country was about one thing and one thing only :COLON how strong was our army ,COMMA how strong was our air force ,COMMA how strong was our navy and how strong were our allies .PERIOD <BREAK>
But now one final thing .PERIOD <BREAK>
Collective security is not enough .PERIOD <BREAK>
Peace has come to Northern Ireland because both sides realized that the zero-sum game couldn't work .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so suddenly ,COMMA ladies and gentlemen ,COMMA what has been the proposition of visionaries and poets down the ages becomes something we have to take seriously as a matter of public policy .PERIOD <BREAK>
I started with a poem ,COMMA I'll end with one .PERIOD <BREAK>
For John Donne ,COMMA a recommendation of morality .PERIOD <BREAK>
But if you ask the average American what the optimal formula of longevity is ,COMMA they probably couldn't tell you .PERIOD <BREAK>
You have the USDA food pyramid .PERIOD <BREAK>
False .PERIOD <BREAK>
It reminds me of my college days .PERIOD <BREAK>
So to make it to age 100 ,COMMA you not only have to have had a very good lifestyle ,COMMA you also have to have won the genetic lottery .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's why a 65 -year-old person is aging at a rate of about 125 times faster than a 12 -year-old person .PERIOD <BREAK>
And research shows that they would be years largely free of chronic disease ,COMMA heart disease ,COMMA cancer and diabetes .PERIOD <BREAK>
But the real secret I think lies more in the way that they organize their society .PERIOD <BREAK>
Just look at the advertisements .PERIOD <BREAK>
One fifth the rate of colon and breast cancer ,COMMA big killers here in America .PERIOD <BREAK>
We're down to one and half right now .PERIOD <BREAK>
This particular Moai ,COMMA these five ladies have been together for 97 years .PERIOD <BREAK>
And then one day ,COMMA boom ,COMMA we retire .PERIOD <BREAK>
But they influence each other in profound and measurable ways .PERIOD <BREAK>
They don't have any conveniences .PERIOD <BREAK>
That burns calories just as much as going on the treadmill does .PERIOD <BREAK>
They know how to set up their life in the right way so they have the right outlook .PERIOD <BREAK>
You know the two most dangerous years in your life are the year you're born ,COMMA because of infant mortality ,COMMA and the year you retire .PERIOD <BREAK>
And they have strategies to keep from overeating ,COMMA little things that nudge them away from the table at the right time .PERIOD <BREAK>
And then the foundation of all this is how they connect .PERIOD <BREAK>
Diets don't work .PERIOD No diet in the history of the world has ever worked for more than two percent of the population .PERIOD <BREAK>
So when I had the chance to give the world's expert in gravity the experience of zero gravity ,COMMA it was incredible .PERIOD <BREAK>
You can get eight ,COMMA 10 minutes of weightlessness -- how NASA's trained their astronauts for so long .PERIOD <BREAK>
And you can actually roll some of the pictures now ,COMMA because I don't want to look at me on the screen .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's almost like that old recipe for chicken soup where you boil the chicken until the flavor is just gone .PERIOD <BREAK>
These micro-machines ,COMMA which are the envy of nanotechnologists the world over ,COMMA are self-directed ,COMMA powerful ,COMMA precise ,COMMA accurate devices that are made out of strings of amino acids .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so what I'm going to show you is a three-minute Reader's Digest version of the first aspect of this film that we produced .PERIOD It's an ongoing project that's going to go another four or five years .PERIOD <BREAK>
And each of us has about 100000 of these things running around ,COMMA right now ,COMMA inside each one of your 100 trillion cells .PERIOD <BREAK>
So no matter how lazy you feel ,COMMA you're not really intrinsically doing nothing .PERIOD <BREAK>
And three years ago ,COMMA one of the things I learned how to do was to become invisible .PERIOD <BREAK>
I didn't always succeed .PERIOD <BREAK>
A friend told me ,COMMA shortly after that ,COMMA that she had heard that Tim Russert ,COMMA a nationally renowned journalist ,COMMA had been talking about me on national TV .PERIOD <BREAK>
In my country ,COMMA that was the case in 1974 .PERIOD <BREAK>
The women said ,COMMA We agree .PERIOD We'll use pills ,COMMA but we need a doctor to prescribe the pills ,COMMA and we had very ,COMMA very few doctors .PERIOD <BREAK>
Wherever there were people -- and you can see boats with the women ,COMMA selling things -- here's the floating market selling bananas and crabs and also contraceptives -- wherever you find people ,COMMA you'll find contraceptives in Thailand .PERIOD <BREAK>
We introduced our first microcredit program in 1975 ,COMMA and the women who organized it said ,COMMA We only want to lend to women who practice family planning .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's a part of the Village Development Bank ;SEMICOLON it's not a real bank ,COMMA but it's a fund -- microcredit .PERIOD <BREAK>
And then we thought we'd help America ,COMMA because America's been helping everyone ,COMMA whether they want help or not .PERIOD <BREAK>
I said ,COMMA Don't worry .PERIOD Come over and I'll do the whole lot of you .PERIOD <BREAK>
And what happened ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Then AIDS came along and hit Thailand ,COMMA and we had to stop doing a lot of good things to fight AIDS .PERIOD <BREAK>
But unfortunately ,COMMA the government was in denial ,COMMA denial ,COMMA denial .PERIOD <BREAK>
And he said ,COMMA Mechai ,COMMA could you come and join ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
He became the chairman of the National AIDS Committee and increased the budget fifty-fold .PERIOD <BREAK>
And then we gave condoms out everywhere on the streets -- everywhere ,COMMA everywhere .PERIOD <BREAK>
And then this is the picture I mentioned to you -- the weapon of mass protection .PERIOD <BREAK>
We all need to help .PERIOD <BREAK>
And before you can borrow the money ,COMMA you need to be trained .PERIOD <BREAK>
Otherwise they'll never get out of poverty .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it's a center ,COMMA a focal point for economic and social development .PERIOD <BREAK>
So we have now found the weapon of mass protection .PERIOD <BREAK>
In the last 20 years I have published a few books ,COMMA but I have lived in anonymity until February of 2006 ,COMMA when I carried the Olympic flag in the Winter Olympics in Italy .PERIOD <BREAK>
That made me a celebrity .PERIOD Now people recognize me in Macy's ,COMMA and my grandchildren think that I'm cool .PERIOD <BREAK>
My measurements .PERIOD <BREAK>
Those athletes had sacrificed everything to compete in the games .PERIOD <BREAK>
When asked in a TV interview ,COMMA How could she look so good ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Sophia Loren was right in front of me -- she's a foot taller than I am ,COMMA not counting the poofy hair .PERIOD <BREAK>
Somehow she manages to keep her seven children alive ,COMMA and a few months later ,COMMA she gives birth to premature twins .PERIOD <BREAK>
Somehow ,COMMA the family survives for 16 months ,COMMA and then ,COMMA by extraordinary luck ,COMMA and the passionate heart of a young American man ,COMMA Sasha Chanoff ,COMMA who manages to put her in a US .PERIOD rescue plane ,COMMA Rose Mapendo and her nine children end up in Phoenix ,COMMA Arizona ,COMMA where they're now living and thriving .PERIOD <BREAK>
Once ,COMMA when my daughter Paula was in her twenties ,COMMA she said to me that feminism was dated ,COMMA that I should move on .PERIOD <BREAK>
Yes ,COMMA for privileged women like my daughter and all of us here today ,COMMA but not for most of our sisters in the rest of the world who are still forced into premature marriage ,COMMA prostitution ,COMMA forced labor -- they have children that they don't want or they cannot feed .PERIOD <BREAK>
The place is a small women's clinic in a village in Bangladesh .PERIOD <BREAK>
She's not licensed for that ;SEMICOLON she has never done it .PERIOD <BREAK>
The woman's face looks like a watermelon .PERIOD <BREAK>
It is so swollen that you can't even see the eyes .PERIOD <BREAK>
Jenny is horrified at what she has done ,COMMA but then the translator explains that the patient's condition has nothing to do with the operation .PERIOD <BREAK>
They are paid less than men for the same work if they're paid at all ,COMMA and they remain vulnerable because they have no economic independence ,COMMA and they are constantly threatened by exploitation ,COMMA violence and abuse .PERIOD <BREAK>
In any war today ,COMMA most of the casualties are civilians ,COMMA mainly women and children .PERIOD They are collateral damage .PERIOD <BREAK>
I'm talking about men with young minds ,COMMA of course .PERIOD <BREAK>
Six billion hungry carnivores to feed ,COMMA by 2050 .PERIOD <BREAK>
And when you think that 80 percent of global trade in food now is controlled by just five multinational corporations ,COMMA it's a grim picture .PERIOD <BREAK>
So the grain markets were to the south of the city .PERIOD <BREAK>
But also you have to imagine it full of food .PERIOD <BREAK>
And if we look at an image of Smithfield in 1830 you can see that it would have been very difficult to live in a city like this and be unaware of where your food came from .PERIOD <BREAK>
It even got built ,COMMA but nothing to do with this vision that Howard had .PERIOD <BREAK>
So I've come up with an alternative ,COMMA which is Sitopia ,COMMA from the ancient Greek ,COMMA sitos for food ,COMMA and topos for place .PERIOD <BREAK>
I believe we already live in Sitopia .PERIOD <BREAK>
So if we were to do that ,COMMA what might Sitopia look like ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Because without these kinds of people we can't have places like this .PERIOD <BREAK>
And equally important is the negative version -- Don't do to others what you would not like them to do to you .PERIOD <BREAK>
I sometimes see when I'm speaking to a congregation of religious people a sort of mutinous expression crossing their faces because people often want to be right instead .PERIOD <BREAK>
And so we have a choice ,COMMA it seems to me .PERIOD <BREAK>
And also see that it demands acute intelligence ,COMMA not just a gooey feeling .PERIOD <BREAK>
In this room ,COMMA all this expertise ,COMMA if we joined it all together ,COMMA we could change the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
Who knew about extension managers ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA why would I care about Rome ,COMMA particularly ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
These are just drawings of Rome .PERIOD I get back as often as possible -- I need to .PERIOD <BREAK>
These are sketches of some of the little details .PERIOD <BREAK>
Here's a little map .PERIOD And I thought of maps at the beginning ;SEMICOLON maybe I should just try and do a little atlas of my favorite streets and connections in Rome .PERIOD <BREAK>
Over the Spanish Steps we go .PERIOD <BREAK>
She parks her dirigible ,COMMA lowers the anchor rope and climbs down for a closer look inside .PERIOD <BREAK>
The text here is right side and upside down so that you are forced to turn the book around ,COMMA and you can see it from ground point of view and from her point of view -- looking in the hole ,COMMA getting a different kind of perspective ,COMMA moving you around the space .PERIOD Particularly appropriate in a building that can contain perfectly a sphere dimensions of the diameter being the same as the distance from the center of the floor to the center of the Oculus .PERIOD <BREAK>
Everything he sees from this point on is slightly affected by the linguine ,COMMA but keeps on moving because this guy's got a job to do .PERIOD <BREAK>
Then I thought ,COMMA Wait a minute ,COMMA what am I doing ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
If I do a foldout page on the left-hand side and let you just unfold it ,COMMA you see behind it what I mean by scar tissue .PERIOD <BREAK>
Pigeon's Progress struck me as a catchy title .PERIOD <BREAK>
You can see the tombs and pines and so on and so forth along the way .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is something that's a little bit unusual .PERIOD <BREAK>
This is one of those things I show to my students because it's a complete bastardization -- a denial of any rules of perspective .PERIOD <BREAK>
I have all the pieces :COLON there's Santa Maria della Pace ,COMMA there's a soccer ball ,COMMA there's a little bit of a bird's wing -- nothing's happening ,COMMA so I had to rethink it .PERIOD <BREAK>
Thank you very much .PERIOD <BREAK>
So there's something super interesting about natural systems .PERIOD <BREAK>
The first two are the MacroBot and DeciBot .PERIOD <BREAK>
One of them is the input from the user ,COMMA as you're building your bricks .PERIOD <BREAK>
So each chain ,COMMA or each element ,COMMA wants to turn right or left .PERIOD <BREAK>
You're telling each unit if it should turn right or left .PERIOD <BREAK>
So you can basically program any three-dimensional shape -- or one-dimensional ,COMMA two-dimensional -- up into this chain completely passively .PERIOD <BREAK>
At the end of the lecture they asked a number of questions ,COMMA but there was one that's really stuck with me since then .PERIOD <BREAK>
And he reached the point where he felt that there must be something out there that was smaller than the smallest forms of life that were ever known -- bacteria ,COMMA at the time .PERIOD <BREAK>
As we started to look at this information ,COMMA we would see that about 20 percent of the genetic information in your nose doesn't match anything that we've ever seen before -- no plant ,COMMA animal ,COMMA fungus ,COMMA virus or bacteria .PERIOD <BREAK>
So can we have the lights off ,COMMA please ,COMMA so we can see it ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Well ,COMMA not quite ,COMMA not quite perfect -- you see ,COMMA in intergalactic space -- intergalactic space is completely dark ,COMMA pitch dark .PERIOD <BREAK>
That's how big and how dark the universe is .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that is how un-typical this place is .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now that is knowledge .PERIOD And if that weren't amazing enough ,COMMA the faithfulness with which the one structure resembles the other is increasing with time .PERIOD That is the growth of knowledge .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now how does the solar system -- and our environment ,COMMA in the form of us -- acquire this special relationship with the rest of the universe ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Well ,COMMA one thing that's true about Stephen Hawking's remark -- I mean ,COMMA it is true ,COMMA but it's the wrong emphasis .PERIOD One thing that's true about it is that it doesn't do it with any special physics .PERIOD There's no special dispensation ,COMMA no miracles involved .PERIOD It does it simply with three things that we have here in abundance .PERIOD <BREAK>
One of them is matter ,COMMA because the growth of knowledge is a form of information processing .PERIOD Information processing is computation ,COMMA computation requires a computer -- there's no known way of making a computer without matter .PERIOD <BREAK>
And the same -- well ,COMMA if we could do that we'd automatically have an energy supply ,COMMA because the transmutation would be a fusion reactor -- and evidence ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
And with a more powerful telescope ,COMMA you'll be able to see stars ,COMMA and planets .PERIOD <BREAK>
And locally there you could build particle accelerators ,COMMA and learn elementary particle physics ,COMMA and chemistry ,COMMA and so on .PERIOD <BREAK>
The danger is not at all unprecedented .PERIOD Species go extinct all the time .PERIOD <BREAK>
And it's true that an ounce of prevention equals a pound of cure ,COMMA but that's only if we know what to prevent .PERIOD <BREAK>
The world is buzzing at the moment with plans to force reductions in gas emissions at all costs .PERIOD <BREAK>
They're not central to the human effort to face this problem ,COMMA or problems in general .PERIOD <BREAK>
And that is ,COMMA I understand that optimists greatly outlive pessimists .PERIOD <BREAK>
It's only 10 years ago this month when we published the first sequence of a free-living organism ,COMMA that of haemophilus influenzae .PERIOD <BREAK>
We can now do that same genome project in the order of two to eight hours .PERIOD <BREAK>
And we started the Sorcerer II Expedition ,COMMA where we were ,COMMA as with great oceanographic expeditions ,COMMA trying to sample the ocean every 200 miles .PERIOD <BREAK>
And with doing this ,COMMA we've made some amazing discoveries .PERIOD <BREAK>
I view that these genes are now not only the design components of evolution .PERIOD <BREAK>
Transposons are just small pieces of DNA that randomly insert in the genetic code .PERIOD <BREAK>
We found that synthesizing accurate DNA in large pieces was extremely difficult .PERIOD <BREAK>
And there's only two countries ,COMMA the US .PERIOD and the former Soviet Union ,COMMA that had major efforts on trying to create biological warfare agents .PERIOD <BREAK>
I think future engineered species could be the source of food ,COMMA hopefully a source of energy ,COMMA environmental remediation and perhaps replacing the petrochemical industry .PERIOD <BREAK>
It was actually a very strange study ,COMMA because the various religious leaders were using their scriptures as law books ,COMMA and they couldn't find anything in them prohibiting making life ,COMMA so it must be OK .PERIOD The only ultimate concerns were biological warfare aspects of this ,COMMA but gave us the go ahead to start these experiments for the reasons we were doing them .PERIOD <BREAK>
It poses a very fascinating puzzle for us .PERIOD <BREAK>
In particular check out Asia .PERIOD <BREAK>
Zoom in on Haiti ,COMMA in outline here .PERIOD <BREAK>
But Deng Xiaoping instinctively understood the importance of offering choices to his people .PERIOD <BREAK>
Demonstrated successes there led to a consensus for a move toward the market model for the entire economy .PERIOD <BREAK>
We can go do it over and over again .PERIOD <BREAK>
We also need the choices for people .PERIOD <BREAK>
The final thing we need are choices for leaders .PERIOD <BREAK>
Now ,COMMA when I say that ,COMMA some of you are starting to think ,COMMA Well ,COMMA is this just bringing back colonialism ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
Let us have a Hong Kong nearby .PERIOD <BREAK>
Some of my citizens will move into that city as well .PERIOD <BREAK>
Many of them totally get the notion of a special zone that people can opt into as a rule .PERIOD <BREAK>
So let me show you why that's wrong .PERIOD <BREAK>
Take this representation of all of the land .PERIOD <BREAK>
Their kids can get an education .PERIOD <BREAK>
So what will it take to get started building the first charter cities ,COMMA scaling this so we build many more ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
