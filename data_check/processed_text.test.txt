Now I'm not a neuroscientist .PERIOD
And how much of that reactive side of it is due to what we already know ,COMMA or what we're going to learn ,COMMA about something ?QUESTIONMARK
And as we assemble these tools ,COMMA from a design point of view ,COMMA I get terribly excited about it ,COMMA because these are things ,COMMA as we've already said ,COMMA they're arriving at the brain ,COMMA it would seem ,COMMA before cognition ,COMMA before we can manipulate them -- electrochemical party tricks .PERIOD
Now when talking about beauty you can't get away from the fact that a lot experiments have been done in this way with faces and what have you .PERIOD
I'm not getting it off the eyebrow .PERIOD
Anais Nin and the Talmud have told us time and time again that we see things not as they are ,COMMA but as we are .PERIOD

Art should be didactic .PERIOD
Whereas the people who are selling us the higher stuff -- the therapists ,COMMA the poets -- are on their own and they have no power ,COMMA they have no might .PERIOD
But you left out one aspect of religion that a lot of people might say your agenda could borrow from ,COMMA which is this sense -- that's actually probably the most important thing to anyone who's religious -- of spiritual experience ,COMMA of some kind of connection with something that's bigger than you are .PERIOD
Is there any room for that experience in Atheism 20 ?QUESTIONMARK
I would say that there are many ,COMMA many gaps in secular life and these can be plugged .PERIOD
And as it happened ,COMMA I read it from midnight to five in the morning in one shot .PERIOD
This is one of the largest underground labs in the world .PERIOD
There is another way to search for dark matter ,COMMA which is indirectly .PERIOD
When a neutrino hits a water molecule it emits a kind of blue light ,COMMA a flash of blue light ,COMMA and by looking for this blue light ,COMMA you can essentially understand something about the neutrino and then ,COMMA indirectly ,COMMA something about the dark matter that might have created this neutrino .PERIOD
But nonetheless ,COMMA it's an extraordinary piece of engineering .PERIOD
Here's another view of the same .PERIOD

It is ,COMMA by far and away ,COMMA the largest print library in the world .PERIOD
Then the question is ,COMMA what do you get ?QUESTIONMARK
It's starting to be a little bit more specified .PERIOD
But I have to say that there's older technologies that I tend to like .PERIOD
And it turns out to not be very hard .PERIOD
You can actually get really good-looking books for on the order of one penny per page ,COMMA sort of the parts cost for doing this .PERIOD
And so we've tried that ,COMMA and I'll go over that in a moment .PERIOD
And it's called the Espresso Book Machine ,COMMA and in about 10 minutes ,COMMA you can press a button and make a book .PERIOD
And one of my favorites in this is the $ 100 laptop .PERIOD
If you really care about books ,COMMA you're going to scan them better ,COMMA especially if they're valuable books .PERIOD
So all in all ,COMMA that's going very well .PERIOD
And so we're starting up a program to do out-of-print works ,COMMA but loaning them .PERIOD
But it is within our grasp ,COMMA technologically and law-wise ,COMMA at least for the out of print and out of copyright ,COMMA we suggest ,COMMA to be able to get the whole darn thing online .PERIOD
It's sort of the biggest TiVo box you've ever seen .PERIOD
It's about a petabyte ,COMMA so far ,COMMA of worldwide television -- Russian ,COMMA Chinese ,COMMA Japanese ,COMMA Iraqi ,COMMA Al Jazeera ,COMMA BBC ,COMMA CNN ,COMMA ABC ,COMMA CBS ,COMMA NBC -- 24 hours a day .PERIOD

How is that possible ?QUESTIONMARK
The tallest plants on Earth at that time were less than two feet .PERIOD
The Earth was struck by an asteroid ,COMMA a huge amount of debris was jettisoned into the atmosphere .PERIOD
We were involved with several experiments .PERIOD
There were four piles saturated with diesel and other petroleum waste :COLON one was a control pile ;SEMICOLON one pile was treated with enzymes ;SEMICOLON one pile was treated with bacteria ;SEMICOLON and our pile we inoculated with mushroom mycelium .PERIOD
The mycelium is producing enzymes -- peroxidases -- that break carbon-hydrogen bonds .PERIOD
So I invented burlap sacks ,COMMA bunker spawn -- and putting the mycelium -- using storm blown debris ,COMMA you can take these burlap sacks and put them downstream from a farm that's producing E .PERIOD coli ,COMMA or other wastes ,COMMA or a factory with chemical toxins ,COMMA and it leads to habitat restoration .PERIOD
There's more than a 100 million colonies per gram ,COMMA and 10 to the third power is around 1000 .PERIOD
In 48 hours to 72 hours ,COMMA these three mushroom species reduced the amount of coliform bacteria 10000 times .PERIOD
This is a space-conservative method that uses storm debris -- and we can guarantee that we will have storms every year .PERIOD
So ,COMMA this one mushroom ,COMMA in particular ,COMMA has drawn our interest over time .PERIOD
And a few years ago ,COMMA we received these results .PERIOD
10 or greater are considered to be very active .PERIOD
And so ,COMMA for the first time ,COMMA I am showing this .PERIOD
And we're using a natural extract within the same dosage window as a pure pharmaceutical .PERIOD

The Life Box -- you're gonna be getting a DVD of the TED conference -- you add soil ,COMMA you add water ,COMMA you have mycorrhizal and endophytic fungi as well as spores ,COMMA like of the Agarikon mushroom .PERIOD
The seeds then are mothered by this mycelium .PERIOD
I've also lived in Biosphere 2 .PERIOD
Well ,COMMA in 1991 it was finally time for us to go in and try out this baby .PERIOD
The day I walked into Biosphere 2 ,COMMA I was ,COMMA for the first time ,COMMA breathing a completely different atmosphere than everybody else in the world ,COMMA except seven other people .PERIOD
We were taking their biomass ,COMMA storing them in the basement ,COMMA growing plants ,COMMA going around ,COMMA around ,COMMA around ,COMMA trying to take all of that carbon out of the atmosphere .PERIOD

And one documentary writer ,COMMA who was here and looked at this two months after I was here ,COMMA described this not as beehives but as a graveyard ,COMMA with these empty white boxes with no bees left in them .PERIOD
It was called that because a guy in Israel first found it ,COMMA and he now regrets profoundly calling it that disease ,COMMA because ,COMMA of course ,COMMA there's the implication .PERIOD
We needed beeswax for a project we were working on ;SEMICOLON he was so capable ,COMMA he was able to render the nicest block of beeswax I have ever seen from cow dung ,COMMA tin cans and his veil ,COMMA which he used as a screening ,COMMA right in this meadow .PERIOD And so that ingenuity is inspiring .PERIOD
And we see these families ,COMMA these nomadic families ,COMMA you know ,COMMA father to son ,COMMA father to son ,COMMA and these guys are hurting .PERIOD
We have bumblebees on the top .PERIOD
Dennis vanEngelsdorp :COLON Bee .PERIOD Okay ,COMMA thanks .PERIOD
And in fact ,COMMA there is now a red list of pollinators that we're worried have disappeared ,COMMA and on top of that list are a lot of these kleptoparasites ,COMMA but also these bumblebees .PERIOD
There are other animals that pollinate ,COMMA like bats ,COMMA and bats are in trouble too .PERIOD
But I'm glad to say that I think we know the cause of all these conditions ,COMMA and that cause is NDD :COLON Nature Deficit Disorder .PERIOD
And that is ,COMMA make meadows and not lawns .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA not all of us have meadows ,COMMA or lawns that we can convert ,COMMA and so you can always ,COMMA of course ,COMMA grow a meadow in a pot .PERIOD
And everyone should open a beehive ,COMMA because it is the most amazing ,COMMA incredible thing .PERIOD
And if we want to cure ourselves of NDD ,COMMA or Nature Deficit Disorder ,COMMA I think this is a great way of doing it .PERIOD
She Googled ,COMMA and she found this World Whistling Championship in America ,COMMA of course .PERIOD
Okay ,COMMA I'm not the only one whistling here .PERIOD

Why ?QUESTIONMARK
This is not the common man .PERIOD
You know very well about professors .PERIOD
When he speaks about animals ,COMMA [he] tends to remove the fact that plants exist .PERIOD
The blue whale ,COMMA the biggest creature that exists on the planet -- that is wrong ,COMMA completely wrong .PERIOD

Many insects have been used by plants as vectors for the transport of the pollination ,COMMA but not just insects ;SEMICOLON even birds ,COMMA reptiles ,COMMA and mammals like bats rats are normally used for the transportation of the pollen .PERIOD
This is a serious business .PERIOD
So we studied the root apex and we found that there is a specific region that is here ,COMMA depicted in blue -- that is called the transition zone .PERIOD
Now we know that a root apex has just a few hundred cells that show this kind of feature ,COMMA but we know how big the root apparatus of a small plant ,COMMA like a plant of rye .PERIOD
They work in the same way .PERIOD
Well ,COMMA if you want to fly ,COMMA it's good that you look at birds -- to be inspired by birds .PERIOD
But if you want to explore soils ,COMMA or if you want to colonize new territory ,COMMA to best thing that you can do is to be inspired by plants that are masters in doing this .PERIOD
It's much more easy to work with plants than with animals .PERIOD

It doesn't require any special training .PERIOD
It's a quite wonderfully designed animal .PERIOD

And you might say it's about the reverse engineering of religions .PERIOD

It's like a coin flip ;SEMICOLON it doesn't count really .PERIOD

But I'm not just talking about Islam .PERIOD
I'm talking also about Christianity .PERIOD

Just enough repetition .PERIOD
And it would just be insincere of me not to address those problems .PERIOD
That's worth mentioning .PERIOD
You could stop reading this book because life would have no purpose or meaning or significance .PERIOD
But that is just a difference of opinion .PERIOD
That's not what I'm really worried about .PERIOD

Space squeezes and stretches as it emanates out from these black holes banging on the universe .PERIOD
Want to get away from the sound .PERIOD
Now that chirp is very characteristic of black holes merging -- that it chirps up at the end .PERIOD
There are very industrious experiments being built on Earth -- one called LIGO -- which will detect deviations in the squeezing and stretching of space at less than the fraction of a nucleus of an atom over four kilometers .PERIOD
It's everywhere ,COMMA it's all around you ,COMMA and the space is wobbling chaotically .PERIOD
Imagine a billion years ago ,COMMA two black holes collided .PERIOD
If it was the Big Bang we were going to pick up ,COMMA it would sound like this .PERIOD

There's no choice in this :COLON that only confirms the reality that the wholeness cannot be different from you ,COMMA cannot be minus you .PERIOD
You express yourself because you have compassion .PERIOD
There is no shortcut :COLON it is like swimming by swimming .PERIOD
That's interesting to me .PERIOD
You fake it and make it .PERIOD
If you know how to pray ,COMMA pray .PERIOD
Well ,COMMA it has its pluses and minuses .PERIOD
Therefore ,COMMA we don't find the moral ,COMMA emotional ,COMMA psychological and political space to distance ourselves from the reality of social responsibility .PERIOD
Oddly enough ,COMMA an artist such as myself finds herself also in the position of being the voice ,COMMA the speaker of my people ,COMMA even if I have ,COMMA indeed ,COMMA no access to my own country .PERIOD
We are there to take pride and insist on respect .PERIOD
I envy sometimes the artists of the West for their freedom of expression .PERIOD
Our people depend on our artists ,COMMA and culture is beyond communication .PERIOD
I work in Morocco ,COMMA in Turkey ,COMMA in Mexico .PERIOD
How to tell a political story but an allegorical story .PERIOD
What was most significant for me was ,COMMA once again ,COMMA the presence of the women .PERIOD
Start differentiating into effector and memory cells .PERIOD
We have a million students a month using the site ,COMMA watching on the order of 100 to 200000 videos a day .PERIOD
And then in a response to that same comment -- this is on the thread .PERIOD
But the paradigm here is ,COMMA we'll generate as many questions as you need until you get that concept ,COMMA until you get 10 in a row .PERIOD
In a traditional classroom ,COMMA you have a couple of homework ,COMMA homework ,COMMA lecture ,COMMA homework ,COMMA lecture ,COMMA and then you have a snapshot exam .PERIOD
But as ridiculous as that sounds ,COMMA that's exactly what's happening in our classrooms right now .PERIOD
So you can imagine -- and this is what we are working on -- is from this knowledge map you have logic ,COMMA you have computer programming ,COMMA you have grammar ,COMMA you have genetics ,COMMA all based off of that core of ,COMMA if you know this and that ,COMMA now you're ready for this next concept .PERIOD
It'll change what happens at the dinner table .PERIOD
Green means the student's already proficient .PERIOD
And the data gets pretty granular so you can see the exact problems that the student got right or wrong .PERIOD
And so the same kids that you thought were slow six weeks ago ,COMMA you now would think are gifted .PERIOD
And I think what you'll see emerging is this notion of a global one-world classroom .PERIOD
I'm still doing all the videos ,COMMA but we have a rockstar team doing the software .PERIOD
And they're doing it at the district level .PERIOD
And they're literally saying ,COMMA Hey ,COMMA this is nice ,COMMA but .PERIOD Like that focus graph ,COMMA a lot of the teachers said ,COMMA I have a feeling that a lot of the kids are jumping around and not focusing on one topic .PERIOD
But yeah ,COMMA it's all there .PERIOD
And seeing with the brain is often called imagination .PERIOD
So I am going to be talking about hallucinations ,COMMA and a particular sort of visual hallucination which I see among my patients .PERIOD
Animals too .PERIOD
I see cats and dogs walking towards me .PERIOD
She said ,COMMA It's got color .PERIOD It's got motion .PERIOD
I said ,COMMA There is a special form of visual hallucination which may go with deteriorating vision or blindness .PERIOD
And you have Charles Bonnet syndrome .PERIOD
And about 10 percent of the visually impaired people get visual hallucinations .PERIOD
Now with the original description in the 18 th century ,COMMA Charles Bonnet did not have them .PERIOD
On one occasion ,COMMA he saw a man in a bathrobe smoking a pipe ,COMMA and realized it was himself .PERIOD
These cartoons would be transparent and would cover half the visual field ,COMMA like a screen .PERIOD
But what did disturb her was she got very persistent images or hallucinations of faces and as with Rosalie ,COMMA the faces were often deformed ,COMMA with very large teeth or very large eyes .PERIOD
In particular ,COMMA the notion is that if you see things or hear things ,COMMA you're going mad ,COMMA but the psychotic hallucinations are quite different .PERIOD
And in particular ,COMMA one area of the temporal lobe is called the fusiform gyrus .PERIOD
And now we know that there are hundreds of other sorts of cells ,COMMA which can be very ,COMMA very specific .PERIOD
Well ,COMMA I've more or less said what I wanted .PERIOD
But they stop there .PERIOD
Well they don't disturb me any more than my tinnitus ,COMMA which I ignore .PERIOD
They occasionally interest me ,COMMA and I have many pictures of them in my notebooks .PERIOD
So it's a little-appreciated fact that most of the animals in our ocean make light .PERIOD
I've spent most of my career studying this phenomenon called bioluminescence .PERIOD
I also use it as a tool for visualizing and tracking pollution .PERIOD
This is the first time it has ever been recorded .PERIOD
So that light was made by a bioluminescent dinoflagellate ,COMMA a single-celled alga .PERIOD
There's a lot of animals that use this trick ,COMMA for example this black dragonfish .PERIOD
It's got a light organ under its eye .PERIOD
It's a scream for help ;SEMICOLON it's meant to attract attention .PERIOD
There's other ways you can defend yourself with light .PERIOD
This little squid is called the fire shooter because of its ability to do this .PERIOD
This is a golden coral ,COMMA a bush .PERIOD
We're talking to something .PERIOD
But he's persistent .PERIOD
We need more eyes on the process .PERIOD
Scientists have always created pictures as part of their thinking and discovery process .PERIOD
In the top left-hand corner ,COMMA you've got this yellow-green area .PERIOD
And those red molecules are hemoglobin .PERIOD
And hemoglobin acts as a molecular sponge to soak up the oxygen in your lungs and then carry it to other parts of the body .PERIOD
And that's how I really began .PERIOD So let's begin .PERIOD
Those are the letters of genetic code ,COMMA the 25000 genes you've got written in your DNA .PERIOD
But they physically run in opposite directions ,COMMA which creates a number of complications for your living cells ,COMMA as you're about to see ,COMMA most particularly when DNA is being copied .PERIOD
And so what I'm about to show you is an accurate representation of the actual DNA replication machine that's occurring right now inside your body ,COMMA at least 2002 biology .PERIOD
And it's jiggling and wiggling there because of the surrounding soup of molecules ,COMMA which I've stripped away so you can see something .PERIOD
But in each one of your cells ,COMMA each strand of DNA is about 30 to 40 million nanometers long .PERIOD
It is made up of about 200 different types of proteins ,COMMA thousands of proteins in total .PERIOD
That is the signal broadcasting system sending out the stop signal .PERIOD
This is how you work at the molecular scale .PERIOD
And we don't know exactly how they did this ,COMMA although they must have solved some collective action problems ;SEMICOLON it only makes sense that you can't hunt mastodons while you're fighting with the other groups .PERIOD
So that raised a social question that I believe must have driven new social forms .PERIOD
Again ,COMMA we can't know ,COMMA but we can be pretty sure that some form of symbolic communication must have been involved .PERIOD
We saw scientific revolutions ,COMMA the Protestant Reformation ,COMMA constitutional democracies possible where they had not been possible before .PERIOD
I'm going to talk briefly about two of them :COLON the prisoner's dilemma and the tragedy of the commons .PERIOD
Garrett Hardin used it to talk about overpopulation in the late 1960 s .PERIOD
And most recently ,COMMA neurophysiological measures have shown that people who punish cheaters in economic games show activity in the reward centers of their brain .PERIOD
Jim Surowiecki briefly mentioned Yochai Benkler's paper about open source ,COMMA pointing to a new form of production :COLON peer-to-peer production .PERIOD
Toyota ,COMMA instead of treating its suppliers as a marketplace ,COMMA treats them as a network and trains them to produce better ,COMMA even though they are also training them to produce better for their competitors .PERIOD
I don't think we've even begun to discover what the basic principles are ,COMMA but I think we can begin to think about them .PERIOD
I believe that the payoff would be very big .PERIOD
What forms of suffering could be alleviated ,COMMA what forms of wealth could be created if we knew a little bit more about cooperation ?QUESTIONMARK
I don't think that this transdisciplinary discourse is automatically going to happen ;SEMICOLON it's going to require effort .PERIOD
I'm not going to dive into them either ,COMMA but photosynths are integrated into the map .PERIOD
So this is something that we're now going to try for the first time ,COMMA live ,COMMA and this is really ,COMMA truly ,COMMA very frightening .PERIOD
No ,COMMA no .PERIOD The other way .PERIOD
This is the current -- thank you -- this is the current time .PERIOD If we scrub the time ,COMMA then we can see how the sky will look at different times ,COMMA and we can get all of this very detailed information about different times ,COMMA different dates :COLON Let's move the moon a little higher in the sky ,COMMA maybe change the date .PERIOD
All right now ,COMMA I've overrun my time ,COMMA so I've got to stop .PERIOD
Sophal Ear :COLON So ,COMMA notwithstanding the 1970 s narration ,COMMA on April 17 th 1975 we lived in Phnom Penh .PERIOD
They were young soldiers ,COMMA typically child soldiers .PERIOD
So the Khmer Rouge took us from a place called Pursat to Kaoh Tiev ,COMMA which is across from the border from Vietnam .PERIOD
And we end up in Hong Ngu on the Vietnamese side .PERIOD
And then onwards to Chau Doc .PERIOD
Thank you mother .PERIOD
Somebody has to be a witness to what has happened to you .PERIOD
And one evening ,COMMA I was sitting next to a very nice gentleman in Kabul ,COMMA and he asked what I thought would be good in Afghanistan .PERIOD
This was our sign -- it's hand-painted ,COMMA and we had 45 all over Kabul .PERIOD
We developed a culturally-sensitive psycho-social counseling approach .PERIOD
And now you are helping me to regain some confidence in the future .PERIOD
Child :COLON There is no difference here between classes ,COMMA nor white or black ,COMMA nor if you have money or not .PERIOD
Simply ,COMMA if you are talented ,COMMA if you have the vocation and the will to be here ,COMMA you get in .PERIOD You share with us and make music .PERIOD
In its essence ,COMMA the orchestra and the choir are much more than artistic structures .PERIOD
That's how they build a spirit of solidarity and fraternity among them ,COMMA develop their self-esteem and foster the ethical and aesthetical values related to the music in all its senses .PERIOD
All this makes up a constructive and ascending social dynamic .PERIOD
It's what makes a little girl play the clarinet at home ,COMMA while her mother does the housework .PERIOD
And these will be some simple design qualities and they will also be some qualities of ,COMMA if you will ,COMMA the intelligence of interaction .PERIOD
Now we've put people 18 inches in front of a TV ,COMMA and all the artifacts that none of the original designers expected to be seen ,COMMA all of a sudden ,COMMA are staring you in the face :COLON the shadow mask ,COMMA the scan lines ,COMMA all of that .PERIOD
And my favorite example is always fingers .PERIOD
In fact ,COMMA they're not :COLON it's really a very ,COMMA very high-resolution input medium -- you have to just do it twice ,COMMA you have to touch the screen and then rotate your finger slightly -- and you can move a cursor with great accuracy .PERIOD
And we have never known how to do this technically ,COMMA so this slide is a fake slide .PERIOD
OK .PERIOD So there is the pressure-sensitive display in operation .PERIOD
The person's just ,COMMA if you will ,COMMA pushing on the screen to make a curve .PERIOD
And what you can do -- oops ,COMMA I didn't mean to do that -- what you can do is actually feed back to the user the feeling of the physical properties .PERIOD
What I'll show you very quickly is a new kind of book where it is mixed now with .PERIOD all sorts of things live in there ,COMMA but you have to keep a few things in mind .PERIOD
So it knows ,COMMA or at least there is computer-readable information in the medium itself .PERIOD It's just not a static movie frame .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA that would be ,COMMA if you will ,COMMA the top green track ,COMMA which doesn't mean too much .PERIOD But you might have to elaborate for me or for somebody who isn't an expert ,COMMA and say ,COMMA Cook at 380 degrees for 45 minutes .PERIOD
If you're in a classroom situation and somebody asks a question ,COMMA the last thing you do is repeat what you just said .PERIOD
He says ,COMMA Well ,COMMA reading is this junk they give me in little books to read .PERIOD
And that story has many other anecdotes that are similar ,COMMA but wow .PERIOD The key to the future of computers in education is right there ,COMMA and it is :COLON when does it mean something to a child ?QUESTIONMARK
What the truth is is that speaking has great value to a child ;SEMICOLON the child can get a great deal by talking to you .PERIOD
Well ,COMMA in Senegal we found that this was the traditional classroom :COLON 120 kids -- three per desk -- one teacher ,COMMA a little bit of chalk .PERIOD
That's what meant something to her ,COMMA is doing the hair pattern ,COMMA and actually did it within two days -- an hour each day -- and found it was ,COMMA to her ,COMMA absolutely the most meaningful piece .PERIOD
And my last example -- as some of my former colleagues ,COMMA whom I see in the room ,COMMA can imagine what it will be .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA that is sufficiently zany that we would ,COMMA obviously ,COMMA jump to the bait ,COMMA and we did .PERIOD
So if I ,COMMA all of a sudden ,COMMA turn to the person to my left and start talking to that person ,COMMA then at the person to my right's site ,COMMA he'll see these two plastic heads talking to each other .PERIOD
And then if that person interrupts ,COMMA then those two heads may turn .PERIOD
We're testing these kinds of simple sensor-network technologies in the home so that any phone that a senior is already comfortable with can help them deal with their medications .PERIOD
And as we monitor phone usage by seniors over a long period of time ,COMMA down to the tenths of a microsecond ,COMMA that recognition moment of whether they can figure out that person on the other end is a friend and we start talking to them immediately ,COMMA or they do a lot of what's called trouble talk ,COMMA where they're like ,COMMA Wait ,COMMA who is this ?QUESTIONMARK Oh .PERIOD Right ?QUESTIONMARK
So ,COMMA sensors are looking at that kind of voice .PERIOD
If they have a hip fracture we go with them and we study their entire discharge experience .PERIOD
This is 50 tsunamis scheduled on the calendar ,COMMA but somehow we can't sort of marshal our government and innovative forces to sort of get out in front of it and do something about it .PERIOD We'll wait until it's more of a catastrophe ,COMMA and react ,COMMA as opposed to prepare for it .PERIOD
This mentality of traveling to and timesharing large ,COMMA expensive healthcare systems actually began in 1787 .PERIOD
We have to shift from this mainframe mentality of healthcare to a personal model of healthcare .PERIOD
How do we collect not just biological data but behavioral data ,COMMA psychological data ,COMMA relational data ,COMMA in and on and around the home ?QUESTIONMARK
They fixed her back up .PERIOD She was never going to be able to move back into the assisted living .PERIOD They put her into the nursing home unit .PERIOD
I'm not bragging about how much we fund ;SEMICOLON it's how little anyone else actually pays attention to aging and funds innovation on aging ,COMMA chronic disease management and independent living in the home .PERIOD
And so that's what I've been striving for all of my life .PERIOD
But instead ,COMMA I go out and I find things .PERIOD
Then I just pick things up .PERIOD
And so ,COMMA at that time ,COMMA I was able to make some interesting hypotheses along with my colleagues .PERIOD
The appearance of them would have been different -- which it is in all social animals .PERIOD
In social groups of animals ,COMMA the juveniles always look different than the adults .PERIOD
And probably a whole bunch of trees as well .PERIOD
Now it wasn't DNA ;SEMICOLON she didn't find DNA .PERIOD
We gave samples to Mary Schweitzer ,COMMA and she was actually able to determine that B-rex was a female based on medullary tissue found on the inside of the bone .PERIOD
And so we built a laboratory in the back of an 18 -wheeler trailer ,COMMA and actually took the laboratory to the field where we could get better samples .PERIOD
I mean ,COMMA it was wonderful stuff .PERIOD
So that's what I'm here to tell you about :COLON how we are going to fix a chicken .PERIOD
We started out with a wolf-like creature and we ended up with a Maltese .PERIOD
And so that's what we're looking into .PERIOD
Archaeopteryx ,COMMA which is a bird ,COMMA a primitive bird ,COMMA still has that very primitive hand .PERIOD
It has the three fingers ,COMMA the three digits .PERIOD
Birds have basically rudimentary tails .PERIOD
But a gene turns on and resorbs the tail ,COMMA gets rid of it .PERIOD
And people always say ,COMMA Why do that ?QUESTIONMARK
What the Frigoris you doing ?QUESTIONMARK Names are important .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA Frank is this clear to you ,COMMA Djabran Fluctus ?QUESTIONMARK
Listen ,COMMA I'm going back to the swamp mermaid .PERIOD Can you call me in a little while ?QUESTIONMARK
So ,COMMA these are actual names of people that work there .PERIOD
I did some more investigation .PERIOD
There are some mapping people who do use their names .PERIOD
So ,COMMA formulas relate number to form .PERIOD
They got little babies in there ,COMMA floating in there .PERIOD
It's a different kind of course .PERIOD And they've got five apples ?QUESTIONMARK
Because that's why we're here ,COMMA really ,COMMA I think to figure stuff out and to love each other .PERIOD
They are so different .PERIOD
Bode's law wasn't even his law .PERIOD It was a guy named Titus .PERIOD
Just a correlation that indicates how things are misinterpreted .PERIOD
Golden section ,COMMA I've been obsessed with this thing since before I was born .PERIOD
I know that scares a lot of you ,COMMA but that was my purpose entirely .PERIOD
If Fibonacci had been on Paxil ,COMMA that would be the Fibonacci series .PERIOD
Yes ,COMMA Mama .PERIOD
There is so many intricate relationships that I'm not going to go there now ,COMMA because you would say ,COMMA Hey ,COMMA go back to the Fluctus part .PERIOD
And I'm presenting it here at TED .PERIOD Why ?QUESTIONMARK
It just seems like it's not sexy and elegant ,COMMA it's hidden .PERIOD
And look at this ,COMMA built within it is the Golden Ratio .PERIOD
Thank you .PERIOD
Good afternoon .PERIOD
In 1982 ,COMMA in the middle of the Cold War in Soviet Siberia ,COMMA a pipeline exploded with a burst of 3 kilotons ,COMMA the equivalent of a fourth of the Hiroshima bomb .PERIOD
And with these keys ,COMMA they may have been able to get inside CENTCOM's systems ,COMMA to see and hear everything ,COMMA and maybe even infect some of them .PERIOD
As a result ,COMMA the Americans take the threat very seriously .PERIOD
I'll quote General James Cartwright ,COMMA Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff ,COMMA who says in a report to Congress that cyberattacks could be as powerful as weapons of mass destruction .PERIOD
Moreover ,COMMA the Americans have decided to spend over 30 billion dollars in the next five years to build up their cyberwar capabilities .PERIOD
Cyber weapons have this peculiar feature :COLON they can be used without leaving traces .PERIOD
Cartoons are basically short stories .PERIOD
And that prompted people to make maps like this ,COMMA with all kinds of wonderful detail on the land ,COMMA but when you get to the waters edge ,COMMA the ocean looks like one giant puddle of blue paint .PERIOD
And best of all ,COMMA I saw the animals .PERIOD
Could you image if we looked through the Hubble Telescope and we saw that ?QUESTIONMARK
It would start a whole new space race .PERIOD
For instance ,COMMA take these sea turtles .PERIOD
They kind of have a sixth sense like Superman's x-ray vision .PERIOD
They can sense the magnetic fields of the earth .PERIOD
Or take this sea cucumber .PERIOD
He's sort of a Homer Simpson with fins .PERIOD
He goes down and he meets this famous anglerfish .PERIOD
The third storyline I did about a year and a half ago was probably my most difficult .PERIOD
I do three or four strips after that where we explore the finning issue and the shark fin soup issue .PERIOD
There was a real website based in China that actually sold shark fins ,COMMA so I kind of exposed that .PERIOD
And you see you have a beautiful piece of white alabaster .PERIOD
So you say to yourself ,COMMA Well ,COMMA that's worth something .PERIOD
So you go back into the room ,COMMA and you break this thing to pieces ,COMMA and you haul it away .PERIOD
Thanks for listening .PERIOD
Audience :COLON 22 .PERIOD
Audience :COLON 47 .PERIOD
Woman :COLON No .PERIOD
594 .PERIOD Let's give three of them a nice round of applause there .PERIOD
What I'm going to try and do then -- I notice that took some of you a little bit of time to get your answer .PERIOD
Audience :COLON 23 .PERIOD
Audience :COLON 59 .PERIOD
95218564 ?QUESTIONMARK
Eight-digit capacity -- don't you hate that ?QUESTIONMARK
In the meanwhile ,COMMA let me conclude the first part of my show by doing something a little trickier .PERIOD
Really scramble them up this time ,COMMA please .PERIOD
For my next number -- while I mentally recharge my batteries ,COMMA I have one more question for the audience .PERIOD
Let's see ,COMMA starting with -- let's start with a gentleman first ,COMMA OK sir ,COMMA what year was it ,COMMA first of all ?QUESTIONMARK That's why I start with a gentleman first .PERIOD
Yell it out ,COMMA what year ?QUESTIONMARK Audience :COLON 1959 .PERIOD
1959 ,COMMA OK -- and the month ?QUESTIONMARK
Audience :COLON May .PERIOD AB :COLON May what ?QUESTIONMARK
It was .PERIOD AB :COLON And it was cloudy .PERIOD
57683 squared .PERIOD Yuck .PERIOD
I'm going to break the problem down into three parts .PERIOD
I'll do 57000 squared ,COMMA plus 683 squared ,COMMA plus 57000 times 683 times two .PERIOD
While I explain something else -- -- I know ,COMMA that you can use ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK
That seems right ,COMMA I'll go on .PERIOD Cookie fission ,COMMA OK .PERIOD
A third time ,COMMA it's just being a technician .PERIOD
So ,COMMA I'm not going to talk about that .PERIOD
Get them out of schools ,COMMA and keep them out of schools .PERIOD
Having said that ,COMMA I outlined my talk about five minutes ago .PERIOD
No ,COMMA if you want to know what society's going to be like in 20 years ,COMMA ask a kindergarten teacher .PERIOD
But to me ,COMMA things aren't the future .PERIOD
Right away ,COMMA I hope that all of your eyes glaze over .PERIOD
This is a Klein bottle .PERIOD
It's one sided .PERIOD It's a bottle whose inside is its outside .PERIOD
It has zero volume .PERIOD And it's non-orientable .PERIOD
It has wonderful properties .PERIOD
That was a month of my life .PERIOD
Oh ,COMMA cool .PERIOD I can get to this place over here ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK
I take lunch hour .PERIOD
One of the things that I've done for my science students is to tell them ,COMMA Look ,COMMA I'm going to teach you college-level physics .PERIOD
is a constant .PERIOD When the frequency goes up ,COMMA the wavelength comes down .PERIOD Wavelength goes up ,COMMA frequency goes down .PERIOD So ,COMMA if we have a wave here -- over here ,COMMA that's what's interesting -- as the pitch goes up ,COMMA things get closer ,COMMA pitch goes down ,COMMA things stretch out .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA so I know the frequency .PERIOD
Those of you who are physicists ,COMMA I hear you rolling your eyes ,COMMA but bear with me .PERIOD
It's one of these bell-tower buildings .PERIOD
I keep climbing up ,COMMA go back .PERIOD
A dome ,COMMA one of these ten-foot domes .PERIOD
In this light ,COMMA may science and religion endeavor here for the steady evolution of mankind ,COMMA from darkness to light ,COMMA from narrowness to broad-mindedness ,COMMA from prejudice to tolerance .PERIOD
It's time for me to let it go .PERIOD
We want space efficiency .PERIOD
Finally ,COMMA we want multifunctional spaces and housewares -- a sink combined with a toilet ,COMMA a dining table becomes a bed -- same space ,COMMA a little side table stretches out to seat 10 .PERIOD
Guests ?QUESTIONMARK Move the moving wall ,COMMA have some fold-down guest beds .PERIOD
Thank you .PERIOD
Seriously ,COMMA but dangerously fun .PERIOD
And there it is .PERIOD And I think this is a typical picture of what it was like in a courtyard then .PERIOD
So I'm gonna take you through what I think is a remarkable sequence .PERIOD
Any of you who've been to Africa or had a junkyard dog come after you ,COMMA there is a fixed kind of predatory gaze that you know you're in trouble .PERIOD
And this polar bear stands over the husky ,COMMA no claws extended ,COMMA no fangs taking a look .PERIOD
And it's that state that allows these two creatures to explore the possible .PERIOD
They are beginning to do something that neither would have done without the play signals .PERIOD
And it is a marvelous example of how a differential in power can be overridden by a process of nature that's within all of us .PERIOD
John mentioned that I've done some work with murderers ,COMMA and I have .PERIOD
If you're having a bad day ,COMMA try this :COLON jump up and down ,COMMA wiggle around -- you're going to feel better .PERIOD
But it has to be safe exploration .PERIOD
But if you look closely ,COMMA they're kind of like the polar bear and husky :COLON no claws ,COMMA flat fur ,COMMA soft eyes ,COMMA open mouth with no fangs ,COMMA balletic movements ,COMMA curvilinear movements -- all specific to play .PERIOD
We all have an internal narrative that's our own inner story .PERIOD
We don't know a whole lot about what it does for the human brain ,COMMA because funding has not been exactly heavy for research on play .PERIOD
I think that -- that's a few years back -- I think that wave is past ,COMMA and the play wave is cresting ,COMMA because there is some good science .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA the program says that the opposite of play is not work ,COMMA it's depression .PERIOD
Nobody misses that dog I took a picture of on a Carmel beach a couple of weeks ago .PERIOD
You may not know this word ,COMMA but it should be your biological first name and last name .PERIOD
Found that when he looked at a playground out of a window into which he had been confined ,COMMA he felt something different .PERIOD
And looking at his history ,COMMA which is common in the press ,COMMA it seems to me ,COMMA at least -- looking at it from a shrink's point of view -- that a lot of his life was programmed .PERIOD
He had the expectations of his senatorial father and Washington ,COMMA DC .PERIOD
Most of us work with groups ,COMMA and I put this up because the dschool ,COMMA the design school at Stanford ,COMMA thanks to David Kelley and a lot of others who have been visionary about its establishment ,COMMA has allowed a group of us to get together and create a course called From Play to Innovation .PERIOD
So what will follow is a student-made film about just that .PERIOD
But it doesn't have to be that way .PERIOD
Thank You .PERIOD
If you stop a cat from playing -- which you can do ,COMMA and we've all seen how cats bat around stuff -- they're just as good predators as they would be if they hadn't played .PERIOD
And if you look at sleep and dreams biologically ,COMMA animals sleep and dream ,COMMA and they rehearse and they do some other things that help memory and that are a very important part of sleep and dreams .PERIOD
The next step of evolution in mammals and creatures with divinely superfluous neurons will be to play .PERIOD
Well ,COMMA I think the only way I know to do it is to have accumulated the advisers that I have who go from practitioners -- who can establish through improvisational play or clowning or whatever -- a state of play .PERIOD
Unfortunately ,COMMA that hasn't been done sufficiently for the National Science Foundation ,COMMA National Institute of Mental Health or anybody else to really look at it in this way seriously .PERIOD
So our diners started to get bored with this idea ,COMMA and we decided to give them the same course twice ,COMMA so here we actually took an element from the maki roll and and took a picture of a dish and then basically served that picture with the dish .PERIOD
It's a glycoprotein called miraculin ,COMMA a naturally occurring thing .PERIOD It still freaks me out every time I eat it ,COMMA but it has a unique ability to mask certain taste receptors on your tongue ,COMMA so that primarily sour taste receptors ,COMMA so normally things that would taste very sour or tart ,COMMA somehow begin to taste very sweet .PERIOD
As long as it's good for you and good for the environment ,COMMA it doesn't matter .PERIOD
Aside from one-person ABC mini-bureaus in Nairobi ,COMMA New Delhi and Mumbai ,COMMA there are no network news bureaus in all of Africa ,COMMA India or South America -- places that are home to more than two billion people .PERIOD
And can we afford not to ?QUESTIONMARK Thank you .PERIOD
At this time ,COMMA there were thousands of individuals ,COMMA we think ,COMMA that were infected with HIV .PERIOD
OK now ,COMMA more importantly ,COMMA had we been there in the ' 40 s and ' 50 s ,COMMA ' 60 s ,COMMA had we seen this disease ,COMMA had we understood exactly what was going on with it ,COMMA how might that have changed and completely transformed the nature of the way this pandemic moved ?QUESTIONMARK
Nevertheless ,COMMA we spend the vast majority of our energy focused on this level of the pyramid ,COMMA trying to tackle things that are already completely adapted to human beings ,COMMA that are going to be very very difficult to address -- as we've seen in the case of HIV .PERIOD
So during the last 15 years ,COMMA I've been working to actually study the earlier interface here -- what I've labeled viral chatter ,COMMA which was a term coined by my mentor Don Burke .PERIOD
Narrator :COLON Deep in a remote region of Cameroon ,COMMA two hunters stalk their prey .PERIOD
A group of hunters approach ,COMMA their packs loaded with wild game .PERIOD
This is challenging work to do .PERIOD
But -- when he began to speak they would actually recognize his voice from the radio .PERIOD
So what happened ?QUESTIONMARK So during the 10 years that we've been doing this work ,COMMA we actually surprised ourselves .PERIOD
We made a number of discoveries .PERIOD
It's something we should be following .PERIOD It's not something that we should be surprised by .PERIOD
So it's not just hunters in Central Africa .PERIOD
And somehow the idea that one would want to make art for the iPhone ,COMMA which my friends and I are doing now ,COMMA is still not reflected in our understanding of what computers are for .PERIOD
If you look carefully ,COMMA you can even see a hint of the Apple menu ,COMMA up here in the upper left ,COMMA where the virtual world has literally punched through to the physical .PERIOD
Because this is ,COMMA in some sense ,COMMA the first way ,COMMA that people discover their own potential as actors ,COMMA and discover their own agency .PERIOD
By saying Who is that person in the mirror ?QUESTIONMARK Oh it's actually me .PERIOD
Song is one of our oldest ways of making ourselves heard and understood .PERIOD
And so ,COMMA whereas Dr .PERIOD Oliver Sacks has talked about how perhaps one person in a million actually has true synesthesia ,COMMA where they hear colors or taste shapes ,COMMA and things like this ,COMMA phonaesthesia is something we can all experience to some extent .PERIOD
So the idea is you step into a kind of a magic light .PERIOD
You know ?QUESTIONMARK They don't imagine the person in the booth ,COMMA typing it all .PERIOD
And it's one of the most interesting technical challenges that's very currently active in the computer sciences :COLON being able to have a camera that can understand ,COMMA from a fairly big distance away ,COMMA how these little tiny balls are actually pointing in one way or another to reveal what you're interested in ,COMMA and where your attention is directed .PERIOD
And so I've been beginning ,COMMA with a variety of different projects ,COMMA to understand how people can relate to machines with their eyes .PERIOD
In the first one which I'm going to show you ,COMMA called Eyecode ,COMMA it's a piece of interactive software in which ,COMMA if we read this little circle ,COMMA the trace left by the looking of the previous observer looks at the trace left by the looking of previous observer .PERIOD
But if I come up really close and stare directly at the camera on this laptop then you'll see these nice crisp eyes .PERIOD
And what you're typing are recordings of your eyes as you're looking at other peoples' eyes .PERIOD
And this exists in larger installations where there are thousands and thousands of eyes that people could be staring at ,COMMA as you see who's looking at the people looking at the people looking before them .PERIOD
Checking him out .PERIOD
You say what you're doing in 140 characters or less ,COMMA and people who are interested in you get those updates .PERIOD
It is by sharing these moments as they're happening that lets people feel more connected and in touch ,COMMA despite distance ,COMMA and in real time .PERIOD
One of my favorites is what happened a few months ago when there was a gas shortage in Atlanta .PERIOD
It's happened more and more lately ,COMMA whether it's raising money for homeless people or to dig wells in Africa or for a family in crisis .PERIOD
Evan Williams :COLON Nice .PERIOD Thanks .PERIOD
And I would like to tell you a few personal stories about what I like to call the danger of the single story .PERIOD
My characters also drank a lot of ginger beer because the characters in the British books I read drank ginger beer .PERIOD
I realized that people like me ,COMMA girls with skin the color of chocolate ,COMMA whose kinky hair could not form ponytails ,COMMA could also exist in literature .PERIOD
But the unintended consequence was that I did not know that people like me could exist in literature .PERIOD
So what the discovery of African writers did for me was this :COLON It saved me from having a single story of what books are .PERIOD
So I felt enormous pity for Fide's family .PERIOD
If I had not grown up in Nigeria ,COMMA and if all I knew about Africa were from popular images ,COMMA I too would think that Africa was a place of beautiful landscapes ,COMMA beautiful animals ,COMMA and incomprehensible people ,COMMA fighting senseless wars ,COMMA dying of poverty and AIDS ,COMMA unable to speak for themselves and waiting to be saved by a kind ,COMMA white foreigner .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA I've laughed every time I've read this .PERIOD
So that is how to create a single story ,COMMA show a people as one thing ,COMMA as only one thing ,COMMA over and over again ,COMMA and that is what they become .PERIOD
My cousin Polle died because he could not get adequate healthcare .PERIOD
What the Nigerian writer Chinua Achebe calls a balance of stories .PERIOD
What if my roommate knew about my Nigerian publisher ,COMMA Mukta Bakaray ,COMMA a remarkable man who left his job in a bank to follow his dream and start a publishing house ?QUESTIONMARK
He disagreed .PERIOD He felt that people who could read ,COMMA would read ,COMMA if you made literature affordable and available to them .PERIOD
What if my roommate knew about the female lawyer who recently went to court in Nigeria to challenge a ridiculous law that required women to get their husband's consent before renewing their passports ?QUESTIONMARK
Stories matter .PERIOD
We face momentous decisions with important consequences throughout our lives ,COMMA and we have strategies for dealing with these decisions .PERIOD
We've surrendered our power ,COMMA trading off our discomfort with uncertainty for the illusion of certainty that they provide .PERIOD
It literally flat-lined .PERIOD
But what my research has shown me is that experts tend on the whole to form very rigid camps ,COMMA that within these camps ,COMMA a dominant perspective emerges that often silences opposition ,COMMA that experts move with the prevailing winds ,COMMA often hero-worshipping their own gurus .PERIOD
A recent study in the Archives of Surgery reported surgeons removing healthy ovaries ,COMMA operating on the wrong side of the brain ,COMMA carrying out procedures on the wrong hand ,COMMA elbow ,COMMA eye ,COMMA foot ,COMMA and also mistakes born out of thinking errors .PERIOD
Why was it that ,COMMA when I had an operation ,COMMA my doctor said to me ,COMMA Beware ,COMMA Ms .PERIOD Hertz ,COMMA of hyperpyrexia ,COMMA when he could have just as easily said ,COMMA Watch out for a high fever .PERIOD
You see ,COMMA being ready to take experts on is about also being willing to dig behind their graphs ,COMMA their equations ,COMMA their forecasts ,COMMA their prophecies ,COMMA and being armed with the questions to do that -- questions like :COLON What are the assumptions that underpin this ?QUESTIONMARK
If we are to shift paradigms ,COMMA if we are to make breakthroughs ,COMMA if we are to destroy myths ,COMMA we need to create an environment in which expert ideas are battling it out ,COMMA in which we're bringing in new ,COMMA diverse ,COMMA discordant ,COMMA heretical views into the discussion ,COMMA fearlessly ,COMMA in the knowledge that progress comes about ,COMMA not only from the creation of ideas ,COMMA but also from their destruction -- and also from the knowledge that ,COMMA by surrounding ourselves by divergent ,COMMA discordant ,COMMA heretical views .PERIOD
Google CEO Eric Schmidt is a practical practitioner of this philosophy .PERIOD
But just imagine if we were to junk this notion of expertise as some sort of elite cadre and instead embrace the notion of democratized expertise -- whereby expertise was not just the preserve of surgeons and CEO's ,COMMA but also shop-girls -- yeah .PERIOD
Thank you .PERIOD
And so the thought that I started with was how do you do this ,COMMA still within the boundary of the science we know today -- no time for science fair ,COMMA no time for playing around with things or waiting for the magic battery to show up .PERIOD
First component is you charge the car whenever you stop -- ends up that cars are these strange beasts that drive for about two hours and park for about 22 hours .PERIOD
Now that last mile ,COMMA last foot ,COMMA in a sense ,COMMA is the first step of the infrastructure .PERIOD
What we found out ,COMMA when you move from molecules to electrons ,COMMA something interesting happens .PERIOD
We have a battery bay .PERIOD It costs the same hundred dollars as the gas tank .PERIOD
Those of you who have a hard time calculating what that means -- in the average consumer environment we're in in the US .PERIOD
That's a new economic factor ,COMMA which is fascinating to most people .PERIOD
So we went out ,COMMA and we looked at all the car companies .PERIOD
And I had to quit and come and do this thing called A Better Place .PERIOD
We decided to come into the US .PERIOD
The foundation of this curve is that we keep losing the wells that are close to the ground .PERIOD
By 2015 we would have had at least 250 million new cars even at the pace we're going at right now .PERIOD
And then we do the OPEC stimulus package also known as 200 dollars a barrel .PERIOD
And that's the difference between problems that are additive ,COMMA like CO 2 ,COMMA which we go slowly up and then we tip ,COMMA and problems that are depletive ,COMMA in which we lose what we have ,COMMA which oscillate ,COMMA and they oscillate until we lose everything we've got .PERIOD
You have to remember that the world today is bringing in so many cars .PERIOD
You're looking at a world where cars are matched with windmills .PERIOD
That's one percent a year .PERIOD
And when we go to COP 15 at the end of this year we can't stop thinking of padding CO 2 .PERIOD
We have to start thinking about giving kickers to countries that are willing to go to this kind of scale .PERIOD
And there will be about a 20 percent chance we'll recover him .PERIOD
We have to make it immediately .PERIOD
And we need to do it not within 20 years or 50 years ,COMMA but within this presidential term because if we don't ,COMMA we will lose our economy ,COMMA right after we'd lost our morality .PERIOD
They see us as rocking the boat ,COMMA and you can understand why .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA it may sound as though I'm about to preach atheism ,COMMA and I want to reassure you that that's not what I'm going to do .PERIOD
Essentially ,COMMA it does it by providing a smooth ramp of gradual step-by-step increment .PERIOD
It turns out to be ,COMMA in principle ,COMMA incapable of doing the job required of it .PERIOD
So ,COMMA we're used to not challenging religious ideas and it's very interesting how much of a furor Richard creates when he does it .PERIOD He meant me ,COMMA not that one .PERIOD
It teaches them to accept authority ,COMMA revelation and faith instead of always insisting on evidence .PERIOD
But suppose -- -- in 1987 ,COMMA a reporter asked George Bush ,COMMA Sr .PERIOD
whether he recognized the equal citizenship and patriotism of Americans who are atheists .PERIOD
She clearly feels in a beleaguered minority ,COMMA but actually ,COMMA how do American atheists stack up numerically ?QUESTIONMARK
The survey that I quoted ,COMMA which is the ARIS survey ,COMMA didn't break down its data by socio-economic class or education ,COMMA IQ or anything else .PERIOD
But let me know show you some data that have been properly published and analyzed on one special group ,COMMA namely ,COMMA top scientists .PERIOD
In 1998 ,COMMA Larson and Witham polled the cream of American scientists ,COMMA those who'd been honored by election to the National Academy of Sciences ,COMMA and among this select group ,COMMA belief in a personal God dropped to a shattering seven percent .PERIOD
Similar figures obtained for belief in personal immortality .PERIOD
I've not seen corresponding figures for elite scholars in other fields ,COMMA such history or philosophy ,COMMA but I'd be surprised if they were different .PERIOD
And I've already hinted what that something is .PERIOD
From what I've seen of TED ,COMMA I think this may be the ideal place to launch it .PERIOD
Again ,COMMA I fear it will cost money .PERIOD
I suspect that the word atheist itself contains or remains a stumbling block far out of proportion to what it actually means ,COMMA and a stumbling block to people who otherwise might be happy to out themselves .PERIOD
Hence the phrase ,COMMA tooth fairy agnostic .PERIOD
The onus is not on the rest of us to say why not .PERIOD
But we don't bother to say so ,COMMA and this is why my friend uses tooth fairy agnostic as a label for what most people would call atheist .PERIOD
When atheists like Stephen Hawking and Albert Einstein use the word God ,COMMA they use it of course as a metaphorical shorthand for that deep ,COMMA mysterious part of physics which we don't yet understand .PERIOD
What I want to do this morning is share with you a couple of stories and talk about a different Africa .PERIOD
Already this morning there were some allusions to the Africa that you hear about all the time :COLON the Africa of HIV/AIDS ,COMMA the Africa of malaria ,COMMA the Africa of poverty ,COMMA the Africa of conflict ,COMMA and the Africa of disasters .PERIOD
This is a story about the fact that people want their resources managed properly for their good ,COMMA and not taken out to places where they'll benefit just a few of the elite .PERIOD
Because if we can get the 20 billion dollars sitting out there back ,COMMA it may be far more for some of these countries than all the aid that is being put together .PERIOD
One in four sub-Saharan Africans is Nigerian ,COMMA and it has 140 million dynamic people -- chaotic people -- but very interesting people .PERIOD You'll never be bored .PERIOD
Not the International Monetary Fund .PERIOD Not the World Bank ,COMMA where I worked for 21 years and rose to be a vice president .PERIOD
You couldn't get it .PERIOD You had to bribe .PERIOD
The smartest one ,COMMA first to come in ,COMMA was the MTN company of South Africa .PERIOD
Nigerians themselves began to develop some wireless telecommunications companies ,COMMA and three or four others have come in .PERIOD
And we had GDP grow from an average of 23 percent the previous decade to about 65 percent now .PERIOD
We consolidated them from 89 to 25 banks by requiring that they increase their capital -- share capital .PERIOD
In tourism ,COMMA in many African countries ,COMMA a great opportunity .PERIOD
But you should know that this continent is not -- is a continent of many countries ,COMMA not one country .PERIOD
But imagine the impact on a family :COLON if the parents can be employed and make sure that their children go to school ,COMMA that they can buy the drugs to fight the disease themselves .PERIOD
If we can invest in places where you yourselves make money whilst creating jobs and helping people stand on their own feet ,COMMA isn't that a wonderful opportunity ?QUESTIONMARK Isn't that the way to go ?QUESTIONMARK
Mixing African materials ,COMMA such as we have ,COMMA with materials from elsewhere .PERIOD
And so ,COMMA to start helping that ,COMMA I want to take us back to 1835 .PERIOD
Four and a half million users around the world ,COMMA contributing their leftover computer cycles ,COMMA whenever their computer isn't working ,COMMA by running a screen saver ,COMMA and together sharing their resources to create a massive supercomputer that NASA harnesses to analyze the data coming from radio telescopes .PERIOD
What this picture suggests to us is that we've got a radical change in the way information production and exchange is capitalized .PERIOD Not that it's become less capital intensive -- that there's less money that's required -- but that the ownership of this capital ,COMMA the way the capitalization happens ,COMMA is radically distributed .PERIOD Each of us ,COMMA in these advanced economies ,COMMA has one of these ,COMMA or something rather like it -- a computer .PERIOD
It used to be wireless was one person owned the license ,COMMA they transmitted in an area ,COMMA and it had to be decided whether they would be licensed or based on property .PERIOD
It was too expensive to have decentralized social production ,COMMA to have decentralized action in society .PERIOD That was not about society itself .PERIOD
It's that it's the first time that it's having major economic impact .PERIOD
You have to hire them to spend a lot of time .PERIOD
It's creating ,COMMA and it's most visible when we see it as a new form of competition .PERIOD
Peer-to-peer networks assaulting the recording industry ;SEMICOLON free and open source software taking market share from Microsoft ;SEMICOLON Skype potentially threatening traditional telecoms ;SEMICOLON Wikipedia competing with online encyclopedias .PERIOD
And you see surfers ,COMMA people who see this happening ,COMMA and in some sense build it into a supply chain ,COMMA which is a very curious one .PERIOD Right ?QUESTIONMARK
In 1918 ,COMMA a new virus appeared that killed some 50 to 100 million people .PERIOD
It spread like wildfire and some died within hours of developing symptoms .PERIOD
When they work ,COMMA they can make history ,COMMA but after a while you can barely hear them .PERIOD
Or polio ?QUESTIONMARK How many of you remember the iron lung ?QUESTIONMARK
So let's explore how vaccines work .PERIOD
When you're pre-immunized ,COMMA what happens is you have forces in your body pre-trained to recognize and defeat specific foes .PERIOD
Seth Berkley :COLON Really cool video ,COMMA isn't it ?QUESTIONMARK
In addition ,COMMA wild aquatic birds carry all known strains of influenza .PERIOD
Now luckily ,COMMA that particular virus ,COMMA although very scary at the time ,COMMA did not transmit from person to person very easily .PERIOD
We've got these new antibodies we've identified ,COMMA and we know that they latch onto many ,COMMA many variations of the virus .PERIOD
But ,COMMA you know ,COMMA the research that has occurred from HIV now has really helped with innovation with other diseases .PERIOD
So far ,COMMA animal tests indicate that such a vaccine could prevent severe disease ,COMMA although you might get a mild case .PERIOD
It was a slow ,COMMA cumbersome process that depended on chicken eggs ,COMMA millions of living chicken eggs .PERIOD
Now think of where this leads us .PERIOD
New infectious diseases appear or reappear every few years .PERIOD
Will we be quick enough to react before millions die ?QUESTIONMARK
You also can use adjuvants ,COMMA which are chemicals you mix .PERIOD
I call them the Cheetah Generation .PERIOD
The Cheetah Generation is a new breed of Africans who brook no nonsense about corruption .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA we're talking about a continent that is not poor .PERIOD
There are people who think that we should pour more money ,COMMA more aid into this bowl which leaks .PERIOD
Let's take food imports .PERIOD
Just add that up ,COMMA all these leakages .PERIOD
Kwame Nkrumah ,COMMA Nyerere ,COMMA Kenyatta -- somebody mentioned Idi Amin .PERIOD
By creating wealth ?QUESTIONMARK
And you can't develop the informal and the traditional sectors without an operational understanding of how these two sectors work .PERIOD
Without the council the chief can't pass any law ,COMMA and if the chief doesn't govern according to the will of the people he will be removed .PERIOD
So ,COMMA it's quite appropriate that this section is called a marketplace .PERIOD
What Africans practiced was a different form of capitalism ,COMMA but then after independence ,COMMA all of a sudden ,COMMA markets ,COMMA capitalism became a western institution ,COMMA and the leaders said Africans were ready for socialism .PERIOD
A bigger boat will mean more fish will be caught and landed .PERIOD
They're people getting out of poverty as fast as they can .PERIOD
And the journalist was asking him ,COMMA Why is this so important ?QUESTIONMARK
They disappeared .PERIOD
But a couple of weeks ago ,COMMA I asked a bunch of friends to Google Egypt and to send me screen shots of what they got .PERIOD
And the thing is that the algorithms don't yet have the kind of embedded ethics that the editors did .PERIOD
Now I have to take off my shoes or boots to get on an airplane !EXCLAMATIONMARK
We went in and sat down at the booth ,COMMA and the waitress came over ,COMMA made a big commotion over Tipper .PERIOD
She said Yes ,COMMA that's former Vice President Al Gore and his wife Tipper .PERIOD
It's like beachcombing ,COMMA you know ?QUESTIONMARK Every time the tide comes in and out ,COMMA you find some more shells .PERIOD
It's an easy ,COMMA visible target of concern ,COMMA and it should be ,COMMA but there is more global warming pollution that comes from buildings than from cars and trucks .PERIOD
Insulation ,COMMA better design ,COMMA buy green electricity where you can .PERIOD
A lot of us in here have made that decision and it is really pretty easy .PERIOD
It doesn't mean that if you are a Republican that I'm trying to convince you to be a Democrat .PERIOD We need Republicans as well .PERIOD This used to be a bipartisan issue ,COMMA and I know that in this group it really is .PERIOD Become politically active .PERIOD
We have to buy a lot of those ads .PERIOD
Again ,COMMA the Republicans here ,COMMA this shouldn't be partisan .PERIOD
And all the burning of oil and coal and gas ,COMMA all the fossil fuels ,COMMA have changed the atmosphere greatly .PERIOD
And one of the really most incredible things ,COMMA I think ,COMMA is that there's nobody out there trying to collect it at the site where it is densest .PERIOD
You see people who are really shell-shocked .PERIOD
So this is the Gulf of Mexico ,COMMA sparkling place full of fish .PERIOD
You can see where the oil is concentrated at the surface ,COMMA and then it is attacked ,COMMA because they don't want the evidence ,COMMA in my opinion .PERIOD
We heard that bacteria eat oil ?QUESTIONMARK
So do sea turtles .PERIOD
When it breaks up ,COMMA it has a long way to go before it gets down to bacteria .PERIOD
I heard the most incredible story today when I was on the train coming here .PERIOD
That's the story of thousands of people .PERIOD
The other thing about the Gulf that is important is that there are a lot of animals that concentrate in the Gulf at certain parts of the year .PERIOD
If it's not ,COMMA it's certainly affecting their eggs and larvae ,COMMA I would certainly think .PERIOD
So while the oil spill ,COMMA the leak ,COMMA the eruption ,COMMA is a catastrophe ,COMMA I think it's important to keep in mind that we've done a lot to affect what's in the ocean for a very ,COMMA very long time .PERIOD
We're starting with something that's had a lot of stresses and a lot of problems to begin with .PERIOD
It's just ridiculous .PERIOD
I think that this is the result of gross negligence .PERIOD
The first offshore drills were called harpoons .PERIOD
Your sequence and mine are slightly different .PERIOD
I've got brown eyes ;SEMICOLON you might have blue or gray .PERIOD
I think we should say it all together .PERIOD
And still ,COMMA you may not see the branches .PERIOD
But seriously ,COMMA what's wrong with this ?QUESTIONMARK
You already know enough to tell me -- what's wrong with this statement ?QUESTIONMARK
And so let's do a series of comparisons to show you .PERIOD
I assure you ,COMMA this is very tiny .PERIOD It's just six microns on a side .PERIOD
And that's just a mouse brain -- it's a lot smaller than a human brain .PERIOD
I feel curiosity ,COMMA and I feel wonder ,COMMA but at times I have also felt despair .PERIOD
Why did I choose to study this organ that is so awesome in its complexity that it might well be infinite ?QUESTIONMARK
And there's a lot of evidence that neural activity is encoding our thoughts ,COMMA feelings and perceptions ,COMMA our mental experiences .PERIOD
And if you put those two facts together ,COMMA it means that your experiences can change your connectome .PERIOD
And it might true that just the mere act of thinking can change your connectome -- an idea that you may find empowering .PERIOD
And so we might even speak of the stream of consciousness .PERIOD
I'll give you a hint .PERIOD It's a big number .PERIOD
Zach Kaplan :COLON Keith and I lead a research team .PERIOD
Because the way that he presented the concept -- his approach was totally different than ours .PERIOD He sold it to you as if it was for sale right now .PERIOD
Inventables Water Adventures dares you to launch yourself on a magnetically-levitating board down a waterslide so fast ,COMMA so tall ,COMMA that when you hit the bottom ,COMMA it uses brakes to stop .PERIOD
In addition ,COMMA you can see from the diagram on the right ,COMMA the underpart of the slide would be an electromagnet .PERIOD
So I'm sure all you engineers know that even though aluminum is a metal ,COMMA it's not a magnetic material .PERIOD But something unexpected happens when you drop a magnet down an aluminum tube .PERIOD
It's perfectly clear ,COMMA it's odorless ,COMMA it's colorless .PERIOD
Shape-retaining is common in metal :COLON you bend a piece of aluminum foil ,COMMA and it holds its place .PERIOD Contrast that with a plastic garbage can -- and you can push in the sides and it always bounces back .PERIOD
So my favorite idea for this is to apply the ink to a book .PERIOD
For our last technology ,COMMA we worked again with Roman and his team at the Directors Bureau to develop a commercial from the future to explain how it works .PERIOD
And these dyes change color in response to odors .PERIOD
By detecting the odor of particular bacteria ,COMMA or viruses ,COMMA or even lung cancer ,COMMA the dots will change and they can use software to analyze the results .PERIOD
Because every one of these six changed our understanding of what was possible in the world .PERIOD Prior to seeing this ,COMMA we would have assumed :COLON a 10 -foot pole couldn't fit in your pocket ;SEMICOLON something as inexpensive as ink couldn't sense the way paper is being bent ;SEMICOLON every one of these things -- and we're constantly trying to find more .PERIOD
Thank you .PERIOD
I mean ,COMMA it's crucified .PERIOD
Spanish chef accused of cheating .PERIOD
A huge scandal for a few weeks .PERIOD
That is ,COMMA until I went to Eduardo's farm in Extremadura ,COMMA 50 miles north of Seville ,COMMA right on the Portugal border .PERIOD

Is he like ,COMMA you know -- because he seemed to have an answer for everything ,COMMA and it was always nature .PERIOD
Because ,COMMA really ,COMMA they want you to look at themselves ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK
And we're sitting there ,COMMA and I hear [clapping] from a distance ,COMMA so I look over .PERIOD
To fly south in the winter and north when it gets warm ?QUESTIONMARK
And the problem with saying that ,COMMA of course ,COMMA is that you know ,COMMA at this point it risks hyperbole really easily .PERIOD
I'm really in love with him at this point .PERIOD
He takes the liver when he harvests the foie gras ,COMMA he sticks them in this jar and he confits it .PERIOD
No salt ,COMMA no pepper ,COMMA no oil ,COMMA no spices .PERIOD
We went back out for the final tour of the farm ,COMMA and he showed me the wild pepper plants and the plants that he made sure existed on his farm for salinity .PERIOD
How come you don't give him this ?QUESTIONMARK
I really was moved .PERIOD
The Pharaoh got wind of this and wanted to taste it .PERIOD
And the Jews ,COMMA fearing for their life ,COMMA had to come up with an ingenious idea ,COMMA or at least try and satisfy the Pharaoh's wishes ,COMMA of course .PERIOD
One in which we stop treating the planet as if it were some kind of business in liquidation .PERIOD
Whether we're talking about Brussels sprouts or foie gras .PERIOD
That is our poetry .PERIOD That is our beautiful story .PERIOD
OK ,COMMA I can see ,COMMA if I found something ,COMMA up ,COMMA up ,COMMA and they continue ,COMMA up up up .PERIOD
You ,COMMA you survive .PERIOD It's OK .PERIOD
Nobody's obliged to be a genius .PERIOD

This scenario ,COMMA of this civilization ,COMMA was about becoming powerful ,COMMA intelligent ,COMMA like this idea we have invented ,COMMA this concept of God .PERIOD
You go to the future back ,COMMA back ,COMMA back ,COMMA back ,COMMA like that .PERIOD

So there's that .PERIOD In terms of the content of it ,COMMA you look at stories ,COMMA you think ,COMMA well ,COMMA what are stories but mystery boxes ?QUESTIONMARK
Then there's the thing of mystery in terms of imagination -- the withholding of information .PERIOD You know ,COMMA doing that intentionally is much more engaging .PERIOD
Die Hard ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK Crazy ,COMMA great ,COMMA fun ,COMMA action-adventure movie in a building .PERIOD
There are great scenes -- maybe not the most amazing dramatic scenes in the history of time ,COMMA but pretty great scenes .PERIOD
Father :COLON 'Cause I need it .PERIOD
Come on !EXCLAMATIONMARK So you think of Jaws -- so that's the kind of stuff that ,COMMA like ,COMMA you know ,COMMA the investment of character ,COMMA which is the stuff that really is inside the box ,COMMA you know ?QUESTIONMARK
It's why when people do sequels ,COMMA or rip off movies ,COMMA you know ,COMMA of a genre ,COMMA they're ripping off the wrong thing .PERIOD
You gotta rip off -- you know ,COMMA if you rip something off -- rip off the character .PERIOD
Because ultimately ,COMMA you know ,COMMA the mystery box is all of us .PERIOD So there's that .PERIOD

And in the Egyptian revolution ,COMMA the Revolution 20 ,COMMA everyone has contributed something ,COMMA small or big .PERIOD They contributed something -- to bring us one of the most inspiring stories in the history of mankind when it comes to revolutions .PERIOD
It was actually really inspiring to see all these Egyptians completely changing .PERIOD
But the reason why everyone was silent is what I call the psychological barrier of fear .PERIOD
And that psychological barrier of fear had worked for so many years ,COMMA and here comes the Internet ,COMMA technology ,COMMA BlackBerry ,COMMA SMS .PERIOD
Platforms like YouTube ,COMMA Twitter ,COMMA Facebook were helping us a lot because it basically gave us the impression that ,COMMA Wow ,COMMA I'm not alone .PERIOD
They probably have the best life in the world .PERIOD
And everyone started to think that this guy could be my brother .PERIOD
What are we going to do ?QUESTIONMARK I don't know .PERIOD
In a few days ,COMMA tens of thousands of people there -- angry Egyptians who were asking the ministry of interior affairs ,COMMA Enough .PERIOD

And I'm not going to talk about my experience ,COMMA because this is not about me .PERIOD
The next day I was in Tahrir .PERIOD

The rags were unwrapped from a little girl whose body was massively burned .PERIOD
It was the young women ,COMMA the health aids ,COMMA who cleaned the wounds of this baby and dressed the wounds .PERIOD
And my family brought in a woman whose mother had been a slave to take care of me .PERIOD

I had that condition ,COMMA to a certain extent ,COMMA from my own childhood illness .PERIOD
And in that paralysis ,COMMA of course ,COMMA our capacity for compassion is also paralyzed .PERIOD
The very word terror is global .PERIOD

Now ,COMMA as many of you may remember ,COMMA the Red Brigades was a terrorist ,COMMA Marxist organization which was very active in Italy from the 1960 s until the mid- 1980 s .PERIOD
As part of their strategy the Red Brigades never spoke with anybody ,COMMA not even with their lawyers .PERIOD
In 1993 they declared the end of the armed struggle .PERIOD
But this is exactly what I did because I wanted to know what had turned my best friend into a terrorist ,COMMA and why she'd never tried to recruit me .PERIOD
So ,COMMA because I am a trained economist and I think in economic terms ,COMMA all of the sudden I thought ,COMMA maybe there is something here .PERIOD
And there are three main stages .PERIOD
But above all ,COMMA they started to do serious business with the world of crime .PERIOD
Rogue economics is a force which is constantly lurking in the background of history .PERIOD
And it actually happened again ,COMMA with the fall of the Berlin wall .PERIOD
What does it mean ?QUESTIONMARK That means that it has a privilege that other countries do not have .PERIOD
This privilege is called seigniorage .PERIOD
No other country can do that .PERIOD
What the Patriot Act did was to prohibit US .PERIOD bank ,COMMA and US-registered foreign banks from doing any businesses with off-shore facilities .PERIOD
It also gave the US .PERIOD monetary authorities the right to monitor any dollar transaction taking place anywhere in the world .PERIOD
It was introduced only in the United States .PERIOD
In Europe ,COMMA a similar legislation was not introduced .PERIOD
Cumulatively ,COMMA I will have rowed over 8000 miles ,COMMA taken over three million oar strokes and spent more than 312 days alone on the ocean on a 23 foot rowboat .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA some of you might be thinking ,COMMA Hold on a minute .PERIOD She doesn't look very much like an ocean rower .PERIOD
I thought there were them and there were us ,COMMA and I was not one of them .PERIOD
And I think I knew from day one that it wasn't the right job for me .PERIOD
I'd gone through some changes .PERIOD
And I remember looking at these two versions of my obituary and thinking ,COMMA Oh boy ,COMMA I'm on totally the wrong track here .PERIOD
It was a bit like finishing a marathon and getting out of solitary confinement and winning an Oscar all rolled into one .PERIOD
Mostly ,COMMA a baseball cap ,COMMA rowing gloves and a smile -- or a frown ,COMMA depending on whether I went backwards overnight -- and lots of sun lotion .PERIOD
So ,COMMA because nobody in their straight mind would row straight past Hawaii without dropping in ,COMMA I decided to cut this very big undertaking into three segments .PERIOD
But what do you do ?QUESTIONMARK
I had a meeting with the president there ,COMMA who told me about his exit strategy for his country .PERIOD
I even met one of them and she was just about my size .PERIOD
This is a world-wide community .PERIOD
I plan on being around for a long time ,COMMA and when I'm 90 years old ,COMMA I want to be happy and healthy .PERIOD
It's very difficult to be healthy on a planet where we've poisoned the earth and the sea and the air .PERIOD
And the idea here is that all our Eco-Heroes will log at least one green deed every day .PERIOD
And if you put creation and optimism together ,COMMA you've got two choices that you can talk about .PERIOD
This has been a really galvanizing issue for a long time .PERIOD
This was a scheme by a team called THINK ,COMMA a New York-based team ,COMMA and then there was that one ,COMMA which was the Libeskind scheme .PERIOD
We all want to go out and buy an Audi TT ,COMMA don't we ?QUESTIONMARK
It's in our nature to go ricocheting back and forth between this technocratic solution and a larger ,COMMA sort of more romantic image of where we are .PERIOD
And these are two of the top architectural practices in the United States today .PERIOD
Yeah ,COMMA it's one of those giant camera lenses that takes a picture of the outside world -- it's sort of a little movie ,COMMA without any moving parts -- and projects it on a page ,COMMA and you can see the world outside you as you walk around it .PERIOD
They all want to save money by building the same thing 500 times .PERIOD
Here's the little drawing that tells them how that works -- and that's what will happen in the end .PERIOD
So let's make architectural sand dunes and a beach cabana .PERIOD
So they went out and they modeled a computer model of a sand dune .PERIOD
Only one of whom had ever seen the plans before .PERIOD
It has its own built-in swimming pool ,COMMA very ,COMMA very cool .PERIOD
Here it is going across .PERIOD And there ,COMMA down the other side ,COMMA and you get the same kind of grandeur .PERIOD
I want you to know the room you're looking at is stark white .PERIOD
Rosa Mexicano restaurant ,COMMA where he transports us to the shores of Acapulco ,COMMA up on the Upper West Side ,COMMA with this wall of cliff divers who -- there you go ,COMMA like that .PERIOD
Boo Hewerdine ,COMMA Thomas Dolby ,COMMA thank you very much for inviting me .PERIOD It's been a blessing singing for you .PERIOD
Right now is the most exciting time to see new Indian art .PERIOD
This next artist ,COMMA NS .PERIOD Harsha ,COMMA actually has a studio right here in Mysore .PERIOD
He's putting a contemporary spin on the miniature tradition .PERIOD
He creates these fine ,COMMA delicate images which he then repeats on a massive scale .PERIOD
This next artist is probably the alpha male of contemporary Indian art ,COMMA Subodh Gupta .PERIOD
But I can only hope I've whet your appetite to go out and see and learn more about the amazing things that are happening in art in India today .PERIOD
So I'm going to show you some ways that we can violate your expectations .PERIOD First of all ,COMMA I want to show you the particular illusion here .PERIOD I want you first of all when it pops up on the screen to notice that the two holes are perpendicular to each other .PERIOD These are all perceptual tricks .PERIOD These are real objects that I'm going to show you .PERIOD Now I'm going to show you how it is done .PERIOD I've looped the film here so you can get a very interesting experience .PERIOD I want you to see how this illusion is constructed ,COMMA and it's going to rotate so you see that it's inside out .PERIOD Now watch ,COMMA as it rotates back ,COMMA how quickly your perception snaps .PERIOD OK now .PERIOD
How many of you here see dolphins ?QUESTIONMARK Raise your hand if you see dolphins .PERIOD OK ,COMMA those people who raised their hands ,COMMA afterwards ,COMMA the rest of the audience ,COMMA go talk to them ,COMMA all right ?QUESTIONMARK Actually ,COMMA this is the best example of priming by experience that I know .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA something like this can be used because this is after all talk about design ,COMMA too .PERIOD This was done by Saatchi and Saatchi ,COMMA and they actually got away with this ad in Australia .PERIOD So ,COMMA if you look at this ad for beer ,COMMA all those people are in sort of provocative positions .PERIOD But they got it passed ,COMMA and actually won the Clio awards ,COMMA so it's funny how you can do these things .PERIOD
You can violate your expectations about experience .PERIOD Here is an outside water fountain that I created with some friends of mine ,COMMA but you can stop the water in drops and -- actually make all the drops levitate .PERIOD This is something we're building for ,COMMA you know ,COMMA amusement parks and that kind of stuff .PERIOD
Well ,COMMA there's analog and digital .PERIOD Thought that was appropriate here .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA I'm going to skip ahead since I'm sort of running [behind] .PERIOD I want to show you quickly what I've created ,COMMA some new type of illusions .PERIOD I've done something with taking the Pixar-type illusions .PERIOD So you see these kids the same size here ,COMMA running down the hall .PERIOD The two table tops of the same size .PERIOD
And it's interesting ,COMMA by doing this in this sort of rendered fashion ,COMMA how much stronger the illusions are .PERIOD Any case ,COMMA I hope this has brought you a little joy and happiness ,COMMA and if you're interested in seeing more cool effects ,COMMA see me outside .PERIOD I'd be happy to show you lots of things .PERIOD
So I want to share with you a couple key insights about complexity we're learning from studying nature that maybe are applicable to other problems .PERIOD
I'm here today ,COMMA as June said ,COMMA to talk about a project that my twin sister and I have been doing for the past three and half years .PERIOD
This is our invocation in crochet of a bleached reef .PERIOD
So we went and taught the techniques .PERIOD We did workshops and lectures .PERIOD
The frilly crenulated forms that you see in corals ,COMMA and kelps ,COMMA and sponges and nudibranchs ,COMMA is a form of geometry known as hyperbolic geometry .PERIOD
And the only way that mathematicians know how to model this structure is with crochet .PERIOD It happens to be a fact .PERIOD
Before hyperbolic geometry ,COMMA mathematicians knew about two kinds of space :COLON Euclidean space ,COMMA and spherical space .PERIOD
And they have different properties .PERIOD
Think of the surface of a sphere -- just like a beach ball ,COMMA the surface of the Earth .PERIOD
And on the surface of a sphere ,COMMA a straight line is the biggest possible circle you can draw .PERIOD
To a mathematician if there are two answers ,COMMA and the first two are zero and one ,COMMA there is another number that immediately suggests itself as the third alternative .PERIOD
This nearly drove mathematicians bonkers because ,COMMA like you ,COMMA they're sitting there feeling bamboozled .PERIOD
I've stitched Euclid's parallel postulate on to the surface .PERIOD
Here's two creatures who've never heard of Euclid's parallel postulate -- didn't know it was impossible to violate ,COMMA and they're simply getting on with it .PERIOD
I once asked the mathematicians why it was that mathematicians thought this structure was impossible when sea slugs have been doing it since the Silurian age .PERIOD
And that's true .PERIOD But it also goes deeper than that .PERIOD
And so ,COMMA too ,COMMA we've discovered that there is an infinite taxonomy of crochet hyperbolic creatures .PERIOD
But we found that when we deviated from the specific setness of the mathematical code that underlies it -- the simple algorithm crochet three ,COMMA increase one -- when we deviated from that and made embellishments to the code ,COMMA the models immediately started to look more natural .PERIOD
And kindergarten was actually a very formalized system of education ,COMMA established by a man named Friedrich Froebel ,COMMA who was a crystallographer in the 19 th century .PERIOD
He developed a radical alternative system of engaging the smallest children with the most abstract ideas through physical forms of play .PERIOD
OK ,COMMA so how do you study this mysterious organ ?QUESTIONMARK
So let me give you a few striking examples of this .PERIOD
And if you look ,COMMA tucked away inside the inner surface of the temporal lobes -- you can't see it there -- is a little structure called the fusiform gyrus .PERIOD
But there's another rare syndrome ,COMMA so rare ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA that very few physicians have heard about it ,COMMA not even neurologists .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA the most common interpretation of this ,COMMA which you find in all the psychiatry textbooks ,COMMA is a Freudian view ,COMMA and that is that this chap -- and the same argument applies to women ,COMMA by the way ,COMMA but I'll just talk about guys .PERIOD
Thank God ,COMMA or you would all be sexually aroused when you saw your mother .PERIOD
It's very ingenious ,COMMA as all Freudian arguments are -- -- but didn't make much sense because I have seen the same delusion ,COMMA a patient having the same delusion ,COMMA about his pet poodle .PERIOD
There are neurons there that are sensitive to faces .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA when that area's damaged ,COMMA you lose the ability to see faces ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK
And then the message cascades into the amygdala ,COMMA and then goes down the autonomic nervous system .PERIOD
There's no delusion through the phone .PERIOD
And in fact ,COMMA one student asked me the other day ,COMMA Do they get phantom PMS ?QUESTIONMARK
Now ,COMMA why would a phantom limb be paralyzed ?QUESTIONMARK
How do you unlearn the learned paralysis ,COMMA so you can relieve him of this excruciating ,COMMA clenching spasm of the phantom arm ?QUESTIONMARK
He had a brachial avulsion ,COMMA so the nerves were cut and the arm was paralyzed ,COMMA lying in a sling for a year ,COMMA and then the arm was amputated .PERIOD
My first patient came in ,COMMA and he looked in the mirror ,COMMA and I said ,COMMA Look at your reflection of your phantom .PERIOD
He knows it's a mirror reflection ,COMMA but it's a vivid sensory experience .PERIOD
And he says ,COMMA Oh my God ,COMMA my phantom is moving again .PERIOD I don't believe this !EXCLAMATIONMARK
And then I said ,COMMA Close your eyes .PERIOD
So ,COMMA I said ,COMMA Look ,COMMA Derek -- well ,COMMA first of all ,COMMA the guy can't just go around carrying a mirror to alleviate his pain -- I said ,COMMA Look ,COMMA Derek ,COMMA take it home and practice with it for a week or two .PERIOD
I said ,COMMA What's gone ?QUESTIONMARK
These people muddle up their senses .PERIOD
Why does this happen ?QUESTIONMARK
Now remember -- why does this happen ?QUESTIONMARK
And that is ,COMMA there is an abnormal gene ,COMMA a mutation in the gene that causes this abnormal cross wiring .PERIOD
So ,COMMA every brain region is wired to every other region ,COMMA and these are trimmed down to create the characteristic modular architecture of the adult brain .PERIOD
It's because you're all doing a cross-model synesthetic abstraction ,COMMA meaning you're saying that that sharp inflection -- ki-ki ,COMMA in your auditory cortex ,COMMA the hair cells being excited -- Kiki ,COMMA mimics the visual inflection ,COMMA sudden inflection of that jagged shape .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA this is very important ,COMMA because what it's telling you is your brain is engaging in a primitive -- it's just -- it looks like a silly illusion ,COMMA but these photons in your eye are doing this shape ,COMMA and hair cells in your ear are exciting the auditory pattern ,COMMA but the brain is able to extract the common denominator .PERIOD
Sorry about that .PERIOD
My talk will be in two parts .PERIOD I'll talk first as an astronomer ,COMMA and then as a worried member of the human race .PERIOD
So that's another project for NASA .PERIOD
It landed on the surface .PERIOD This is pictures taken on the way down .PERIOD
There's scant chance of life there -- that's because there's been no time for the nuclear fusion in stars to make silicon and carbon and iron ,COMMA the building blocks of planets and of life .PERIOD
And until we have that synthesis ,COMMA we won't be able to understand the very beginning of our universe because when our universe was itself the size of an atom ,COMMA quantum effects could shake everything .PERIOD
You want to not only synthesize the very large and the very small ,COMMA but we want to understand the very complex .PERIOD
We depend on stars to make the atoms we're made of .PERIOD
We depend on chemistry to determine our complex structure .PERIOD
The geometric mean of the mass of a proton and the mass of the sun is 50 kilograms ,COMMA within a factor of two of the mass of each person here .PERIOD
If I was not a self-effacing Brit ,COMMA I would mention the book myself ,COMMA and I would add that it's available in paperback .PERIOD
First ,COMMA any scientific discovery has benign consequences as well as dangerous ones .PERIOD
He persuaded Einstein ,COMMA as his last act ,COMMA to sign the famous memorandum of Bertrand Russell .PERIOD
We need not just campaigning physicists ,COMMA but we need biologists ,COMMA computer experts and environmentalists as well .PERIOD
I wrote my book ,COMMA Our Final Century ,COMMA as a scientist ,COMMA just a general scientist .PERIOD But there's one respect ,COMMA I think ,COMMA in which being a cosmologist offered a special perspective ,COMMA and that's that it offers an awareness of the immense future .PERIOD
The stupendous time spans of the evolutionary past are now part of common culture -- outside the American Bible Belt ,COMMA anyway -- but most people ,COMMA even those who are familiar with evolution ,COMMA aren't mindful that even more time lies ahead .PERIOD
The unfolding of intelligence and complexity still has immensely far to go ,COMMA here on Earth and probably far beyond .PERIOD
But let's suppose some aliens had been watching our pale blue dot in the cosmos from afar ,COMMA not just for 40 years ,COMMA but for the entire 45 billion-year history of our Earth .PERIOD
Then other things happened even more abruptly .PERIOD
Right now ,COMMA he's in a forest in Georgia .PERIOD
The Bonobo ,COMMA although shorter than us and their arms still longer ,COMMA is more upright ,COMMA just as we are .PERIOD
Slim-bodied ,COMMA Bonobos are by nature very gentle creatures .PERIOD
This is Kanzi and I ,COMMA in the forest .PERIOD
We need more sticks ,COMMA too .PERIOD
Good job .PERIOD
Video :COLON Kanzi now makes his tools ,COMMA just as our ancestors may have made them ,COMMA two-and-a-half million years ago -- by holding the rocks in both hands ,COMMA to strike one against the other .PERIOD
Kanzi's rock is from Gona ,COMMA Ethiopia and is identical to that used by our African ancestors two-and-a-half million years ago .PERIOD
She's also saying the name of that ,COMMA with her voice .PERIOD
Panbanisha began writing the lexigrams on the forest floor .PERIOD
SS :COLON Very nice .PERIOD Beautiful ,COMMA Panbanisha .PERIOD
The curved line is very similar to the lexigram .PERIOD
The next symbol Panbanisha writes represents collar .PERIOD
Researchers began to record what Panbanisha said ,COMMA by writing lexigrams on the floor with chalk .PERIOD
Then he peers eagerly into his mother's mouth .PERIOD
Narrator :COLON Kanzi plays the xylophone ;SEMICOLON using both hands he enthusiastically accompanies Dr .PERIOD Sue's singing .PERIOD
Kanzi and Panbanisha are stimulated by this fun-filled environment ,COMMA which promotes the emergence of these cultural capabilities .PERIOD
So we have a bi-species environment ,COMMA we call it a panhomoculture .PERIOD
Here's a site which allows you to look at recovery spending in California .PERIOD
In fact ,COMMA this is the graph of the number of data sets in the repositories of datagov ,COMMA and datagovuk .PERIOD
And then you can select also other things on the map to see what other factors ,COMMA like the threat level .PERIOD
The light blue is refugee camps these volunteers had spotted from the [satellite images] .PERIOD
So ,COMMA if you've been involved in that at all ,COMMA I just wanted to say :COLON Whatever you've been doing ,COMMA whether you've just been chanting ,COMMA Raw data now !EXCLAMATIONMARK
A man-made moon visible by ordinary citizens ,COMMA it inspired awe and pride that humans had finally launched an object into space .PERIOD
Within a year ,COMMA Congress funded huge weapons increases ,COMMA and we went from 1200 nuclear weapons to 20000 .PERIOD
Support for engineering ,COMMA math and science -- education in general -- boomed .PERIOD
And so ,COMMA if you'll put up with this ,COMMA I would like to enlist your help with a first experiment today .PERIOD The experiment is -- and I notice ,COMMA by the way ,COMMA that when you applauded ,COMMA that you did it in a typical North American way ,COMMA that is ,COMMA you were raucous and incoherent .PERIOD
So what do we make of that ?QUESTIONMARK First of all ,COMMA we know that you're all brilliant .PERIOD
Do you need to be alive ?QUESTIONMARK I mean ,COMMA that's a spooky thought ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK
And you see that in nature .PERIOD
Keep in mind that ,COMMA although it looks as if each individual is acting to cooperate ,COMMA what's really going on is a kind of selfish Darwinian behavior .PERIOD
Each is scattering away at random to try to save its scales or feathers .PERIOD
As I say ,COMMA if you're in a swarm ,COMMA your odds of being the unlucky one are reduced as compared to a small group .PERIOD
There doesn't seem to be anything mystical about this .PERIOD
Specifically ,COMMA it's male fireflies who are all flashing in perfect time together ,COMMA in perfect synchrony ,COMMA to reinforce a message to the females .PERIOD
Scientific papers were published saying it was twitching eyelids that explained it ,COMMA or ,COMMA you know ,COMMA a human being's tendency to see patterns where there are none .PERIOD
But I hope you've convinced yourself now ,COMMA with this nighttime video ,COMMA that they really were very well synchronized .PERIOD
Okay ,COMMA well ,COMMA the issue then is ,COMMA do we need to be alive to see this kind of spontaneous order ,COMMA and I've already hinted that the answer is no .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA you might think that's a bizarre idea .PERIOD
He would shoot his light saber across the abyss ,COMMA making a blade of light ,COMMA and then scamper across on this blade of light .PERIOD
Think of the bridge as being like this platform .PERIOD
Narrator :COLON The most dramatic and shocking footage shows whole sections of the crowd -- hundreds of people -- apparently rocking from side to side in unison ,COMMA not only with each other ,COMMA but with the bridge .PERIOD
This synchronized movement seemed to be driving the bridge .PERIOD
But how could the crowd become synchronized ?QUESTIONMARK
Allan McRobie is a bridge engineer from Cambridge who wrote to me ,COMMA suggesting that a bridge simulator ought to wobble in the same way as the real bridge -- provided we hung it on pendulums of exactly the right length .PERIOD
Their instructions :COLON just walk normally .PERIOD
That indeed ,COMMA a mass extinction was underway in our fields ,COMMA in our agricultural system .PERIOD
So if I were to going to show you all the beans in the world ,COMMA and I had a slide like this ,COMMA and I switched it every second ,COMMA it would take up my entire TED talk ,COMMA and I wouldn't have to say anything .PERIOD
And I said ,COMMA You know what ?QUESTIONMARK These apples come from your ancestors ,COMMA and your ancestors gave them the greatest honor they could give them .PERIOD
The bad news is they're extinct .PERIOD
The coldest growing seasons of the future ,COMMA hotter than the hottest of the past .PERIOD
And then there are just daily disasters that take place in these buildings ,COMMA financial problems and mismanagement and equipment failures ,COMMA and all kinds of things ,COMMA and every time something like this happens ,COMMA it means extinction .PERIOD We lose diversity .PERIOD
Because ,COMMA quite literally ,COMMA if agriculture doesn't adapt to climate change ,COMMA neither will we .PERIOD
Important health message :COLON blogging may be hazardous to your health ,COMMA especially if you are a male .PERIOD
This is male blogging posture sitting ,COMMA and the result is ,COMMA For greater comfort ,COMMA men naturally sit with their legs farther apart than women ,COMMA when working on laptop .PERIOD
This is a very serious research ,COMMA that you should read the underline .PERIOD
Wi-Fi enables you to avoid the processor .PERIOD And there are some enhanced protection measures ,COMMA which I would like to share with you ,COMMA and I would like ,COMMA in a minute ,COMMA to thank Philips for helping .PERIOD
I'm really troubled by that .PERIOD But anyway that's -- the basis of the thing that I want to share with you today ,COMMA though ,COMMA is that right back to where we inspire people who will be our great leaders later .PERIOD
Aviation Week asked me to make a list of who I thought were the movers and shakers of the first 100 years of aviation .PERIOD
Well ,COMMA what happened when I was a little kid was -- some pretty heavy stuff too .PERIOD
And this was at a time when Mars was a hell of a lot more interesting than it is now .PERIOD We thought there'd be animals there ;SEMICOLON we knew there were plants there ;SEMICOLON the colors change ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK
These two new airplanes are the same speed as the DC 8 that was done in 1958 .PERIOD
Here's the biggie ,COMMA and that is ,COMMA you don't have innovation cycles if the government develops and the government uses it .PERIOD
Computers were used for artillery first ,COMMA then IRS .PERIOD
Keep that in mind .PERIOD I put down innovation -- I've looked for innovation cycles in space ;SEMICOLON I found none .PERIOD
And I think I want to talk a little bit about why we had the courage to go out and try that as a small company .PERIOD
But I think once it does ,COMMA we will find solutions ,COMMA and very quickly ,COMMA you'll see those resort hotels in orbit .PERIOD
There's a group of people that have come forward -- and you don't know all of them -- but the ones that have come forward were inspired as young children ,COMMA this little three- to 15 -year-old age ,COMMA by us going to orbit and going to the moon here ,COMMA right in this time period .PERIOD
Paul Allen ,COMMA Elan Musk ,COMMA Richard Branson ,COMMA Jeff Bezos ,COMMA the Ansari family ,COMMA which is now funding the Russians' sub-orbital thing ,COMMA Bob Bigelow ,COMMA a private space station ,COMMA and Carmack .PERIOD
There were a couple of examples here .PERIOD
And I'm talking about if you've got a baby now ,COMMA or if you've got a 10 -year-old now .PERIOD
Relatively soon ,COMMA you'll be able to buy a ticket and fly higher and faster than the highest-performance military operational airplane .PERIOD It's never happened before .PERIOD
You can fly with Russian hardware .PERIOD This is available because a Russian space program is starving ,COMMA and it's nice for them to get 20 million here and there to take one of the seats .PERIOD
And every dollar that flows into that will be spent more efficiently by a factor of 10 to 15 .PERIOD And what that means is before we know it ,COMMA the progress in human space flight ,COMMA with no taxpayer dollars ,COMMA will be at a level of about five times as much as the current NASA budgets for human space flight .PERIOD
And this realization is allowing us to reconceptualize the way that we actually approach these diseases by controlling angiogenesis .PERIOD
Now I'm going to focus on cancer because angiogenesis is a hallmark of cancer ,COMMA every type of cancer .PERIOD
This is a tumor :COLON dark ,COMMA gray ,COMMA ominous mass growing inside a brain .PERIOD
Dr .PERIOD Judah Folkman ,COMMA who was my mentor and who was the pioneer of the angiogenesis field ,COMMA once called this cancer without disease .PERIOD
And ,COMMA unfortunately ,COMMA this late stage of cancer is the one at which it's most likely to be diagnosed ,COMMA when angiogenesis is already turned on and cancer cells are growing like wild .PERIOD
We call this antiangiogenic therapy ,COMMA and it's completely different from chemotherapy because it selectively aims at the blood vessels that are feeding the cancers .PERIOD
Well ,COMMA I've just shown you two very different types of cancer that both responded to antiangiogenic therapy .PERIOD
And we subsequently treated more than 600 dogs .PERIOD
It had already spread to his lymph nodes ,COMMA so we used an antiangiogenic skin cream for the lip and an oral cocktail ,COMMA so we could treat from the inside as well as the outside .PERIOD
And ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA the first pioneering treatments for people ,COMMA as well as dogs ,COMMA are already becoming available .PERIOD
But the real question is :COLON How well do these work in practice ?QUESTIONMARK
So here's actually the patient survival data from eight different types of cancer .PERIOD
But for other tumors and cancer types ,COMMA the improvements have only been modest .PERIOD
And as a doctor ,COMMA I know that once a disease progresses to an advanced stage ,COMMA achieving a cure can be difficult ,COMMA if not impossible .PERIOD
But I actually took a completely opposite approach and began asking :COLON What could we be adding to our diet that's naturally antiangiogenic ,COMMA that could boost the body's defense system and beat back those blood vessels that are feeding cancers ?QUESTIONMARK
This inhibits abnormal angiogenesis by 60 percent .PERIOD
And you can see clearly that the teas vary in their potency from less potent to more potent .PERIOD
This means there's food synergy .PERIOD
Here's some more data from our testing .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA in the lab ,COMMA we can simulate tumor angiogenesis represented here in a black bar .PERIOD
Soy ,COMMA parsley ,COMMA garlic ,COMMA grapes ,COMMA berries ;SEMICOLON I could go home and cook a tasty meal using these ingredients .PERIOD
And ,COMMA like a tumor ,COMMA fat grows when blood vessels grow .PERIOD
Albert Szent-Gyorgi once said that ,COMMA Discovery consists of seeing what everyone has seen ,COMMA and thinking what no one has thought .PERIOD
Right .PERIOD And along those lines ,COMMA for people who might have risk factors for cancer ,COMMA would you recommend pursuing any treatments sort of prophylactically or simply pursuing the right diet with lots of tomato sauce ?QUESTIONMARK
Well ,COMMA you know ,COMMA there's abundant epidemiological evidence .PERIOD
I've designed puzzles for books ,COMMA printed things .PERIOD
But at best they can reach for something more and create a memorable impression .PERIOD
It's all figure .PERIOD
Not strictly an ambigram in the conventional sense .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA if you could pick up the black vase ,COMMA it would look like the figure on top .PERIOD
Here ,COMMA let's make it a little harder .PERIOD Still pretty easy .PERIOD
I wanted to make a sequel .PERIOD
Garry Trudeau calls himself an investigative cartoonist .PERIOD
And I said ,COMMA Well ,COMMA how on Earth can you come up with a sequence of the base pairs in DNA ?QUESTIONMARK
And you have to choose pieces that overlap on the edge .PERIOD
But it takes some persistence .PERIOD
First of all ,COMMA you know ,COMMA for a long time computer games meant things like Doom ,COMMA where you're going around shooting things ,COMMA very violent games ,COMMA very fast ,COMMA aimed at teenage boys .PERIOD Right ?QUESTIONMARK That's who plays computer games .PERIOD
Well ,COMMA guess what ?QUESTIONMARK That's changing .PERIOD
And it's a game you play with other people .PERIOD
A lot of people do Sudoku .PERIOD In fact some doctors prescribe it .PERIOD
Anybody ?QUESTIONMARK
What I want to talk about today is this particular cell ,COMMA or grouping of cells ,COMMA that is in each and every one of us .PERIOD
I want you to imagine that this particular grouping of cells is central to the evolution of our species and the continuation of the human race .PERIOD
And I want you imagine that at some point in history a group of powerful people invested in owning and controlling the world understood that the suppression of this particular cell ,COMMA the oppression of these cells ,COMMA the reinterpretation of these cells ,COMMA the undermining of these cells ,COMMA getting us to believe in the weakness of these cells and the crushing ,COMMA eradicating ,COMMA destroying ,COMMA reducing these cells ,COMMA basically began the process of killing off the girl cell ,COMMA which was ,COMMA by the way ,COMMA patriarchy .PERIOD
To be a leader means not to be a girl .PERIOD
And I'd also like to say that the irony of course ,COMMA is that denying girl ,COMMA suppressing girl ,COMMA suppressing emotion ,COMMA refusing feeling has lead thus here .PERIOD
Where we have now come to live in a world where the most extreme forms of violence ,COMMA the most horrific poverty ,COMMA genocide ,COMMA mass rapes ,COMMA the destruction of the Earth ,COMMA is completely out of control .PERIOD
In the Congo ,COMMA for those of you who don't know ,COMMA there has been a war raging for the last 12 years ,COMMA a war that has killed nearly six million people .PERIOD
Listening to the story of 80 -year-old women who were tied to chains and circled ,COMMA and where groups of men would come and rape them periodically ,COMMA all in the name of economic exploitation to steal the minerals so the West can have it and profit from them .PERIOD
That shattering ,COMMA that opening of my girl cell ,COMMA that kind of massive breakthrough of my heart allowed me to become more courageous ,COMMA and braver ,COMMA and actually more clever than I had been in the past in my life .PERIOD
I want to change the verb .PERIOD
I want the verb to be educate ,COMMA or activate ,COMMA or engage ,COMMA or confront ,COMMA or defy ,COMMA or create .PERIOD
I know a 14 -year-old girl in the Netherlands ,COMMA for example ,COMMA who is demanding that she take a boat and go around the entire world by herself .PERIOD
And I want to talk about a girl that I just met recently in Bukavu ,COMMA who was impregnated by her rapist .PERIOD
She taught girls what a healthy vagina looked like ,COMMA and what a mutilated vagina looked like .PERIOD
And she said ,COMMA Well ,COMMA now ,COMMA I need a house .PERIOD
The whole community has bought in to what she's doing .PERIOD
She imagined her father killing her on one hand ,COMMA and Mama Agnes greeting her ,COMMA with the hope that she would greet her when she got to the house .PERIOD
I had the privilege of being in the hut when she was reunited with her father and reconciled .PERIOD
In that hut ,COMMA we walked in ,COMMA and her father and his four wives were sitting there ,COMMA and her sisters who had just returned because they had all fled when she had fled ,COMMA and her primary mother ,COMMA who had been beaten in standing up for her with the elders .PERIOD
And that is the power of transformation .PERIOD
But I really want to do it for each and every person here ,COMMA to value the girl in us ,COMMA to value the part that cries ,COMMA to value the part that's emotional ,COMMA to value the part that's vulnerable ,COMMA to understand that's where the future lies .PERIOD
I rejoice that it's still in my body .PERIOD
I am an emotional creature .PERIOD
I can take you back .PERIOD
Nothing's been diluted .PERIOD
I love ,COMMA hear me ,COMMA I love that I can feel the feelings inside you ,COMMA even if they stop my life ,COMMA even if they break my heart ,COMMA even if they take me off track ,COMMA they make me responsible .PERIOD
Your body is covered with fractals .PERIOD
Let's see ,COMMA first iteration ,COMMA second ,COMMA third ,COMMA fourth .PERIOD
So Native Americans use a combination of circular symmetry and fourfold symmetry .PERIOD
It is not the same pattern at two different scales .PERIOD
In some cases ,COMMA there would actually be algorithms ,COMMA and very sophisticated algorithms .PERIOD
So I tracked down one of the folks who makes these things ,COMMA this guy in Mali just outside of Bamako ,COMMA and I asked him ,COMMA How come you're making fractal fences ?QUESTIONMARK Because nobody else is .PERIOD
So these guys are right on target for a practical use of scaling technology .PERIOD
The most complex example of an algorithmic approach to fractals that I found was actually not in geometry ,COMMA it was in a symbolic code ,COMMA and this was Bamana sand divination .PERIOD
And finally ,COMMA out of desperation ,COMMA I said ,COMMA Well ,COMMA let me explain Georg Cantor in 1877 .PERIOD
And then you take this symbol ,COMMA and you put it back in so it's a self-generating diversity of symbols .PERIOD
And I know Brian Eno says there's not enough Africa in computers ,COMMA but you know ,COMMA I don't think there's enough African history in Brian Eno .PERIOD
We got a small seed grant ,COMMA just to see if folks would be willing to work with us on this ;SEMICOLON we're very excited about the future possibilities for that .PERIOD

Anyway ,COMMA I like Oprah -- I like her girlfriendy-ness ,COMMA I like her weight issues ,COMMA I like how she's transformed talk television ,COMMA I like how she's brought reading back to America -- but there was something that happened the last two weeks that was .PERIOD I call it the Soon-Yi moment :COLON it is the moment when I cannot continue supporting someone .PERIOD
It makes What the Bleep Do We Know seem like a doctoral dissertation from Harvard on quantum mechanics -- that's how bad it is .PERIOD
I want to try to share just a little bit of that with you in this presentation .PERIOD
The challenge ,COMMA of course ,COMMA is to answer this question :COLON what permits this extraordinary performance of animals that allows them basically to go anywhere ?QUESTIONMARK
And if we could figure that out ,COMMA how can we implement those designs ?QUESTIONMARK
Think about it .PERIOD If you were an engineer and I told you that you had to build an automobile ,COMMA but it had to start off to be this big ,COMMA then it had to grow to be full size and had to work every step along the way .PERIOD
Or think about the fact that if you build an automobile ,COMMA I'll tell you that you also -- inside it -- have to put a factory that allows you to make another automobile .PERIOD
They all produce the pattern of a pogo stick .PERIOD How is that true ?QUESTIONMARK
We took their advice and we modeled the animals moving in the horizontal plane as well .PERIOD We took their three legs ,COMMA we collapsed them down as one .PERIOD
It didn't decrease its preferred speed at all .PERIOD
It has six legs -- there are the tuned ,COMMA springy legs .PERIOD
Robert Full :COLON It'll go on different surfaces -- here's sand -- although we haven't perfected the feet yet ,COMMA but I'll talk about that later .PERIOD
Like if we had a piece of tape now ,COMMA we'd peel it this way .PERIOD
They do this with their toes .PERIOD It's bizarre !EXCLAMATIONMARK This peeling inspired iRobot -- that we work with -- to build Mecho-Geckos .PERIOD
And here's the peeling action of the Mecho-Gecko .PERIOD
Here's an individual hair with a little split end there .PERIOD
No ,COMMA force is too low .PERIOD Do they do it by electrostatics ?QUESTIONMARK
And just recently we've made a breakthrough ,COMMA where we now believe we're going to be able to create the first synthetic ,COMMA self-cleaning ,COMMA dry adhesive .PERIOD Many companies are interested in this .PERIOD
Thank you .PERIOD
We proved that most of the ammonia refrigeration tables are wrong .PERIOD
Most people have cooking fires in the world ,COMMA whether it's camel dung or wood .PERIOD
And the problem is this :COLON Women are not making it to the top of any profession anywhere in the world .PERIOD
We also have another problem ,COMMA which is that women face harder choices between professional success and personal fulfillment .PERIOD
And I said ,COMMA Are you telling me that I am the only woman to have pitched a deal in this office in a year ?QUESTIONMARK
In the high-income part of our workforce ,COMMA in the people who end up at the top -- Fortune 500 CEO jobs ,COMMA or the equivalent in other industries -- the problem ,COMMA I am convinced ,COMMA is that women are dropping out .PERIOD
This is hard .PERIOD I feel guilty sometimes .PERIOD
My brother is kind of busy .PERIOD
Because what the data shows ,COMMA above all else ,COMMA is one thing ,COMMA which is that success and likeability are positively correlated for men and negatively correlated for women .PERIOD
This is the complication .PERIOD
And that's a problem ,COMMA because we have to make it as important a job ,COMMA because it's the hardest job in the world to work inside the home ,COMMA for people of both genders ,COMMA if we're going to even things out and let women stay in the workforce .PERIOD
Message number three :COLON don't leave before you leave .PERIOD
And literally from that moment ,COMMA she doesn't raise her hand anymore ,COMMA she doesn't look for a promotion ,COMMA she doesn't take on the new project ,COMMA she doesn't say ,COMMA Me .PERIOD I want to do that .PERIOD
My generation really ,COMMA sadly ,COMMA is not going to change the numbers at the top .PERIOD
If you want to get at the big part -- I mean from a public health level ,COMMA where my training is -- you're looking at behavioral issues .PERIOD
We talk about it in terms of engagement ,COMMA or non-compliance .PERIOD
So the crux of it comes down to this notion of decision-making -- giving information to people in a form that doesn't just educate them or inform them ,COMMA but actually leads them to make better decisions ,COMMA better choices in their lives .PERIOD
So they asked them at the beginning ,COMMA Do you think you'll actually be able to stick with this program ?QUESTIONMARK
So fear showed up as not really the driver .PERIOD
It was a notion that really came out of Albert Bandura's work ,COMMA who studied whether people could get a sense of empowerment .PERIOD
It's an amazing notion .PERIOD
And I had to explain ,COMMA They're trying to scare people .PERIOD
Again ,COMMA Bandura recognized this years ago ,COMMA decades ago .PERIOD
Okay ,COMMA I know where I sit .PERIOD I know where I'm situated .PERIOD
And that doesn't just work for me in terms of abstract numbers -- this overload of health information that we're inundated with .PERIOD
Finally ,COMMA we need to be presented with a clear point of action .PERIOD
The choice in this case is pretty simple .PERIOD
We either keep going fast ,COMMA or we slow down .PERIOD
They reduce speeds by about five to 10 percent .PERIOD
They last for about five miles ,COMMA in which case we put our foot back on the pedal .PERIOD
And who among us would actually say that people who do try to read this actually get anything out of it ?QUESTIONMARK
They went to the nutritional information box and saw that what works for cereal ,COMMA works for our food ,COMMA actually helps people understand what's in their food .PERIOD
They're just not for us .PERIOD They're not for people .PERIOD They're not for patients .PERIOD
This is the worst presented information .PERIOD
And then we go a further step -- we tell them what they can do .PERIOD
So we take the bold step of putting the cholesterol information on the same page ,COMMA which is the way the doctor is going to evaluate it .PERIOD
The last one I'll show you is a PSA test .PERIOD
And the only acceptable answer is -- -- yes .PERIOD
Okay .PERIOD On the other hand by placing your finger in a different position on the fingerboard it changes the string length ,COMMA that changes the frequency of the sound wave .PERIOD
And now ,COMMA I realize that as the musician ,COMMA we human beings ,COMMA we have a great mind ,COMMA artistic heart and skill that can change the 16 th-century technology and a legendary design to a wonderful entertainment .PERIOD
But .PERIOD although some of them were quite up there for me .PERIOD
And I realized we actually had quite a bit in common :COLON both of us were disseminating the genes of one species and not another ,COMMA and both of us -- probably ,COMMA if I can imagine the bee's point of view -- thought we were calling the shots .PERIOD
We have a grammar that suggests that's who we are ;SEMICOLON that we are sovereign subjects in nature ,COMMA the bee as well as me .PERIOD
And that's when I got the idea ,COMMA which was ,COMMA Well ,COMMA what would happen if we kind of looked at us from this point of view of these other species who are working on us ?QUESTIONMARK
And agriculture suddenly appeared to me not as an invention ,COMMA not as a human technology ,COMMA but as a co-evolutionary development in which a group of very clever species ,COMMA mostly edible grasses ,COMMA had exploited us ,COMMA figured out how to get us to basically deforest the world .PERIOD
And suddenly everything looked different .PERIOD
I'm a dupe .PERIOD I'm a dupe of the lawns ,COMMA whose goal in life is to outcompete the trees ,COMMA who they compete with for sunlight .PERIOD
So ,COMMA let me go through what you gain when you look at the world this way ,COMMA besides some entertaining insights about human desire .PERIOD
As an intellectual matter ,COMMA looking at the world from other species' points of view helps us deal with this weird anomaly ,COMMA which is -- and this is in the realm of intellectual history -- which is that we have this Darwinian revolution 150 years ago .PERIOD
This is a farm in the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia .PERIOD
the idea is he's got six different species of animals ,COMMA as well as some plants ,COMMA growing in this very elaborate symbiotic arrangement .PERIOD
And I'll show you ,COMMA if you take this approach ,COMMA what you get ,COMMA OK ?QUESTIONMARK
So ,COMMA one day ,COMMA cattle in a pen .PERIOD
The Eggmobile is a very rickety contraption -- it looks like a prairie schooner made out of boards -- but it houses 350 chickens .PERIOD
So the chickens do their kind of little breakdance and they're pushing around the manure to get at the grubs ,COMMA and in the process they're spreading the manure out .PERIOD
And within four or five weeks ,COMMA he can do it again .PERIOD
Put that in play .PERIOD
So when they lose a lot of leaf mass ,COMMA they shed roots ;SEMICOLON they kind of cauterize them and the roots die .PERIOD
And they're labeled by color right now ,COMMA by language .PERIOD
But you can also see ,COMMA there are places where there's not so much .PERIOD
But it didn't have quite the same pickup in the US .PERIOD
And so I guess the US .PERIOD finally ,COMMA finally started to like it ,COMMA too .PERIOD
And it's something I'm very excited to be a part of .PERIOD
But it was a dream of his ,COMMA and we ,COMMA basically ,COMMA when people really want to do something ,COMMA well ,COMMA we generally let them .PERIOD
You can see ,COMMA even though the US .PERIOD is still the majority here -- though ,COMMA by the way ,COMMA search-wise ,COMMA it's only about 30 percent of our traffic -- but it's already going to Japan ,COMMA and the UK ,COMMA and Europe ,COMMA and all the rest of the countries .PERIOD
And -- well ,COMMA I'll leave you in suspense .PERIOD
So one of the things -- both Sergey and I went to a Montessori school ,COMMA and I think ,COMMA for some reason ,COMMA this has been incorporated in Google .PERIOD
And Sergey mentioned Orkut ,COMMA which is something that ,COMMA you know ,COMMA Orkut wanted to do in his time ,COMMA and we call this -- at Google ,COMMA we've embodied this as the 20 percent time ,COMMA and the idea is ,COMMA for 20 percent of your time ,COMMA if you're working at Google ,COMMA you can do what you think is the best thing to do .PERIOD
And this was kind of a surprise to me ,COMMA but we found that as long as you keep the 100 things in your head ,COMMA which you did by writing them down ,COMMA that you could do a pretty good job deciding what to do and where to put your resources .PERIOD
So this is a new -- how many of you use the Google Toolbar ?QUESTIONMARK
And the nice thing about this ,COMMA we have a self-serve program ,COMMA and many thousands of websites have signed up ,COMMA and this let's them really make money .PERIOD And I -- you know ,COMMA there's a number of people I met -- I met this guy who runs a conservation site at a party ,COMMA and he said ,COMMA You know ,COMMA I wasn't making any money .PERIOD
And so there is this blog of a young person who was kind of depressed ,COMMA and he said ,COMMA You know ,COMMA I'm sleeping a lot .PERIOD
And I think we're really lucky to have that kind of business model because everyone in the world has access to our search ,COMMA and I think that's a tremendous ,COMMA tremendous benefit .PERIOD
So ,COMMA I'm also fairly determined to try and build a game layer on top of the world .PERIOD
It's not very good .PERIOD It's cluttered .PERIOD
If you're not ,COMMA too bad .PERIOD There's nothing you can do .PERIOD
It's actually about using dynamics ,COMMA using forces ,COMMA to influence the behavior of where you are ,COMMA what you do there ,COMMA how you do it .PERIOD

There are statuses .PERIOD I mean ,COMMA what is valedictorian ,COMMA but a status ?QUESTIONMARK
That sucks .PERIOD Why not level-up ?QUESTIONMARK
And it's very powerful .PERIOD
I mean ,COMMA you see this is a paladin level 10 ,COMMA and that's a paladin level 20 ,COMMA and if you were going to fight ,COMMA you know ,COMMA orcs on the fields of Mordor against the Raz al Ghul ,COMMA you'd probably want to be the bigger one ,COMMA right .PERIOD
Their most dedicated players ,COMMA it's like a full-time job .PERIOD
And we've introduced a progression dynamic into it ,COMMA where ,COMMA by going to the same place over and over ,COMMA by doing challenges ,COMMA by engaging with the business ,COMMA you move a green bar from the left edge of the screen to the right edge of the screen ,COMMA and you eventually unlock rewards .PERIOD
So we have to use this one carefully .PERIOD
It's a woodworking machine ,COMMA or at least a piece of one ,COMMA and my task was to make this thing a little bit more modern ,COMMA a little bit easier to use .PERIOD
Now this gentleman ,COMMA Isambard Kingdom Brunel ,COMMA designed many great things in his career in the 19 th century ,COMMA including the Clifton suspension bridge in Bristol and the Thames tunnel at Rotherhithe .PERIOD

But from the Japanese perspective ,COMMA it's their duty to protect those who don't know any better -- in this case ,COMMA the ignorant gaijin -- from making the wrong choice .PERIOD
As I do so ,COMMA I hope you'll start thinking about some of your own assumptions and how they were shaped by your backgrounds .PERIOD
It is essential for success .PERIOD
The kids got to choose which pile of anagrams they would like to do ,COMMA and they even got to choose which marker they would write their answers with .PERIOD
In reality ,COMMA the kids who were told what to do ,COMMA whether by Miss Smith or their mothers ,COMMA were actually given the very same activity ,COMMA which their counterparts in the first group had freely chosen .PERIOD
In fact ,COMMA some of the kids were visibly embarrassed when they were told that their mothers had been consulted .PERIOD

This narrative promises so much :COLON freedom ,COMMA happiness ,COMMA success .PERIOD
Instead of replacing one story with another ,COMMA we can learn from and revel in the many versions that exist and the many that have yet to be written .PERIOD
No matter where we're from and what your narrative is ,COMMA we all have a responsibility to open ourselves up to a wider array of what choice can do ,COMMA and what it can represent .PERIOD
It brings us that much closer to realizing the full potential of choice ,COMMA to inspiring the hope and achieving the freedom that choice promises but doesn't always deliver .PERIOD
So I brought these two bottles of nail polish into the laboratory ,COMMA and I stripped the labels off .PERIOD
Well ,COMMA good morning .PERIOD
And it's not just what these are doing to each other ,COMMA but it's what the audience thinks that really frames this matter .PERIOD
To get a sense of this ,COMMA and it's been a theme we've talked about all week ,COMMA I recently talked to a bunch of tweeners .PERIOD
Girl 5 :COLON Because they're going to lose all their money eventually .PERIOD

Voice 1 :COLON You'll have to stay here in the safe house until we get word the terrorist threat is over .PERIOD
And media companies realize the audience is important also .PERIOD
And I think this is beginning to happen in the entertainment business .PERIOD
They think of the old medium ,COMMA because the old medium is always the content of the new medium ,COMMA as movies tend to be the content of TV ,COMMA and as books used to be the content ,COMMA novels used to be the content of movies .PERIOD
And I used three criteria :COLON the first was ,COMMA I thought I'd talk about real design within reach ,COMMA design that's free ,COMMA not design not quite within reach ,COMMA as we're fondly known by our competition and competitors ,COMMA but stuff that you can find on the streets ,COMMA stuff that was free ,COMMA stuff that was available to all people ,COMMA and stuff that probably contains some other important messages .PERIOD
Wholly inconsistent with San Francisco or New York .PERIOD
How did I get started in this business ?QUESTIONMARK
In Italy ,COMMA you know ,COMMA almost everything ,COMMA kind of ,COMMA looks good .PERIOD
I've come across some other just ,COMMA kind of ,COMMA curious relationships of bollards on the street that have different interpretations ,COMMA but -- these things amuse me .PERIOD
And I came down one day ,COMMA and all the bikes were red .PERIOD
And at that moment ,COMMA the sun came out ,COMMA and through this perforated screen ,COMMA a pattern was cast over these bodies and they kind of faded into the rear ,COMMA and we left the restaurant kind of feeling OK .PERIOD about stuff .PERIOD
Cities are the place where we're most likely to encounter diversity and to mix with other people .PERIOD
And it's a welcoming area ,COMMA I think ,COMMA inclusive of diversity ,COMMA reflective of diversity ,COMMA and I think this marriage of both technology and art in the public sector is an area where the US .PERIOD
And I decided I had to get closer than just drawing fantasy airplanes .PERIOD
You had to learn what made an airplane stay in the air .PERIOD
I had to learn mathematics and mechanics and all this sort of thing .PERIOD
So I chose furniture .PERIOD
And I chose chairs specifically because I knew something about them .PERIOD
There are drawbacks to this .PERIOD
One is :COLON you can't accommodate everybody .PERIOD
So he said ,COMMA Well I'll come over and look at it .PERIOD
So here we are .PERIOD
So if you watch this chair as I recline ,COMMA the headrest comes up to meet my neck .PERIOD
You cant hit your elbow on bottom .PERIOD
What does that mean ,COMMA my environment ?QUESTIONMARK
And you realize that you spend it in a variety of different places .PERIOD
You spend it at rest and you spend it at work .PERIOD
So then I decided to leave that part of the world ,COMMA and I was going to go to the mid-west .PERIOD
Very nice ,COMMA and there my older ,COMMA senior lungs ,COMMA as I like to call them ,COMMA I filled with particulate matter ,COMMA carbon dioxide and very high doses of ozone .PERIOD
Okay ?QUESTIONMARK Almost like the highest in the nation .PERIOD
So ,COMMA what's wrong with this picture ?QUESTIONMARK
They haven't asked me what kind of the quality of the drinking water that I put in my mouth or the food that I ingest into my stomach .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA I've circled the places where I've been .PERIOD
Oh ,COMMA not so lucky .PERIOD
They give us some sense of what's going to be our train wreck .PERIOD
And all of those black dots are all of the toxic release inventories that are monitored by the EPA .PERIOD
This is what the physician would have in front of him and her when we enter that exam room instead of just the pink slip that said I paid at the counter .PERIOD Right ?QUESTIONMARK

I'd be like some kind of Internet genius ,COMMA and me ,COMMA I'd like to upgrade to deity and maybe just like that -- pop !EXCLAMATIONMARK -- I'd go wireless .PERIOD
I could zip through your servers and firewalls like a virus until the World Wide Web is as wise ,COMMA as wild and as organized as I think a modern-day miracle/oracle can get ,COMMA but ,COMMA ooh-eee ,COMMA you want to bet just how whack and un-PC your Mac or PC is going to be when I'm rocking hot-shit-hot-shot-godnet ?QUESTIONMARK
You don't say a prayer .PERIOD
Thank you ,COMMA TED .PERIOD
So ,COMMA for roughly 300 years ,COMMA the hot debate in architecture was whether the number five or the number seven was a better proportion to think about architecture ,COMMA because the nose was one-fifth of your head ,COMMA or because your head was one-seventh of your body .PERIOD
So ,COMMA whenever you lost information ,COMMA you'd move to symmetry ;SEMICOLON whenever you added information to a system ,COMMA you would break symmetry .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA the only way we could design that ,COMMA or possibly construct it ,COMMA is by using a calculus-based definition of the form .PERIOD
It also is much more dynamic ,COMMA so that you can see that the same form opens and closes in a very dynamic way as you move across it ,COMMA because it has this quality of vector in motion built into it .PERIOD
You just need to incorporate a certain number of traits in a very kind of genetic way .PERIOD
I won't go into too much description of any of these projects ,COMMA but what you can see is that the escalators and elevators that circulate people along the face of the building are all held up by 122 structural trusses .PERIOD
So ,COMMA working with Bentley and MicroStation ,COMMA we've written a custom piece of software that networks all of the components together into these chunks of information ,COMMA so that if we change any element along the length of the building ,COMMA not only does that change distribute through each one of the trusses ,COMMA but each one of the trusses then distributes that information down the length of the entire facade of the building .PERIOD
But what it gives us is a harmonic and synthesized relationship of all these components ,COMMA one to another .PERIOD
At the same time ,COMMA there's a person paying 30000 dollars for a 300 -series car ,COMMA and a person paying 70000 dollars for a 700 series ,COMMA and that person paying more than double doesn't want their car to look too much like the bottom-of-the-market car .PERIOD
So they have to also discriminate between these products .PERIOD
To go back to architecture ,COMMA what's organic about architecture as a field ,COMMA unlike product design ,COMMA is this whole issue of holism and of monumentality is really our realm .PERIOD
And to do that ,COMMA we tried to connect up the five towers into a single system .PERIOD
With United Architects ,COMMA also ,COMMA we made a proposal for the European Central Bank headquarters that used the same system ,COMMA but this time in a much more monolithic mass ,COMMA like a sphere .PERIOD
So ,COMMA for these interiors ,COMMA like this shop in Stockholm ,COMMA Sweden ,COMMA or this installation wall in the Netherlands at the Netherlands Architecture Institute ,COMMA we could use the texture that the tool would leave to produce a lot of the spatial effects ,COMMA and we could integrate the texture of the wall with the form of the wall with the material .PERIOD
What I'd like to do is just drag us all down into the gutter ,COMMA and actually all the way down into the sewer because I want to talk about diarrhea .PERIOD
And in particular ,COMMA I want to talk about the design of diarrhea .PERIOD
If instead transmission to another host requires host mobility ,COMMA then we expect that the winners of the competition will be the milder organisms .PERIOD
So ,COMMA one way you can test is just look at all diarrheal bacteria ,COMMA and see whether or not the ones that tend to be more transmitted by water ,COMMA tend to be more harmful .PERIOD
After a few days of infection you end up having -- the fecal material really isn't so disgusting as we might imagine .PERIOD
And if you took a drop of that water ,COMMA you might find a million diarrheal organisms .PERIOD
If it didn't produce a lot of this toxin ,COMMA then you might find a smaller number .PERIOD
So the task is to try to figure out how to determine whether or not you could get an organism like this to evolve towards mildness by blocking waterborne transmission ,COMMA thereby allowing the organism only to be transmitted by person-to-person contact ,COMMA or person-food-person contact -- both of which would really require that people be mobile and fairly healthy for transmission .PERIOD
One would be to take a lot of different strains of this organism -- some that produce a lot of toxins ,COMMA some that produce a little -- and take those strains and spew them out in different countries .PERIOD
So ,COMMA we don't want to run an experiment like that .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA I don't know how that happened ,COMMA and I didn't have anything to do with it ,COMMA I promise you .PERIOD
The goal is to turn this around .PERIOD
If you could cause an evolutionary decrease in virulence by cleaning up the water supply ,COMMA you should be able to get an evolutionary decrease in antibiotic resistance .PERIOD
And I want to give you just one more example ,COMMA because we've talked a little bit about malaria .PERIOD
In the case of malaria ,COMMA what we'd like to do is mosquito-proof houses .PERIOD
The only pathogens that get transmitted are the ones that are infecting people that feel healthy enough to walk outside and get mosquito bites .PERIOD
So ,COMMA I don't really have time to talk about those things ,COMMA but I did want to put them up there ,COMMA just to give you a sense that there really are solutions to controlling the evolution of harmfulness of some of the nasty pathogens that we're confronted with .PERIOD
And the data really do support this :COLON that you actually do get the virus evolving towards mildness .PERIOD
Anyhow ,COMMA I'll end that there ,COMMA and thank you very much .PERIOD
Our hands are amazing instruments .PERIOD
And when they're missing ,COMMA it's a barrier .PERIOD

So this is really exciting for us ,COMMA because now we have a portal ,COMMA a portal ,COMMA or a way to potentially give back sensation ,COMMA so that he might feel what he touches with his prosthetic hand .PERIOD
We've also gone on with what was initially our primary population of people with above-the-elbow amputations .PERIOD
You had to concentrate a whole lot .PERIOD
Then we fit her with a prosthesis .PERIOD
A little faster .PERIOD And much more easy ,COMMA much more natural .PERIOD
There's a lot of information in those nerve signals ,COMMA and we wanted to get more .PERIOD
And here you can see ,COMMA on Jesse's chest ,COMMA when he just tried to do three different things ,COMMA you can see three different patterns .PERIOD
Obviously ,COMMA that's heavy for Amanda .PERIOD
It took just about probably three to four hours to get it to train .PERIOD
So we're really excited ,COMMA because now we're getting to a clinically practical device .PERIOD
I want you to watch closely .PERIOD
That's Claudia ,COMMA and that was the first time she got to feel sensation through her prosthetic .PERIOD
Once we can do it that small ,COMMA it's a lot easier making them bigger .PERIOD
So Amanda came jet-lagged ,COMMA she's using the arm ,COMMA and everything goes wrong .PERIOD
And none of those problems could I have dealt with ,COMMA but I have a really bright research team .PERIOD
But first ,COMMA I want to start by saying that we need a new operating system ,COMMA for the oceans and for the Earth .PERIOD
Because we've only doubled the population of the Earth since the 1960 s -- a little more than doubled -- but we have 67 billion people in the world ,COMMA and we all like to consume .PERIOD
Humans ,COMMA without fins :COLON 90 meters ,COMMA 35 minutes .PERIOD
So penguins are amazing athletes .PERIOD
And ,COMMA more importantly ,COMMA they're well-dressed .PERIOD
If you go and do it now ,COMMA the national parks count about 500 .PERIOD
So we have a quarter of the penguins that we did 40 years ago .PERIOD
When we have extreme El Nino events ,COMMA you see all this red ,COMMA and you see no green out here around the Galapagos .PERIOD
things die when there's no food .PERIOD
And if you look along the coast of Argentina ,COMMA where I work now ,COMMA at a place called Punta Tombo -- the largest Magellanic penguin colony in the world down here about 44 degrees south latitude -- you see that there's great variation here .PERIOD
And so we have started a global penguin society to try to focus on the real plight of penguins .PERIOD
They ended up swimming through ballast water that had oil in it .PERIOD
So we ended up spending nine years convincing the government that there were lots of oiled penguins .PERIOD
And ,COMMA of course ,COMMA all of this then leads to a vicious cycle and you can't raise a lot of chicks .PERIOD
Turbo has taken to knocking on the door with his beak ,COMMA we let him in and he comes in here .PERIOD
So this is Turbo .PERIOD
And now he's looking at the other guy ,COMMA saying ,COMMA You are really weird .PERIOD
Most important thing is :COLON Only you can change yourself ,COMMA and only you can change the world and make it better ,COMMA for people as well as penguins .PERIOD
But let's talk about the 90 percent of the world population that will never leave the place in which they were born .PERIOD
Over 50 new countries were born .PERIOD
And they share a lengthy land border .PERIOD
In fact ,COMMA the World Bank predicts that Russia's population is declining towards about 120 million people And there is another thing that you don't see on this map .PERIOD
Stalin ,COMMA Khrushchev and other Soviet leaders forced Russians out to the far east to be in gulags ,COMMA labor camps ,COMMA nuclear cities ,COMMA whatever the case was .PERIOD
As a result ,COMMA in the Russian far east today ,COMMA which is twice the size of India ,COMMA you have exactly six million Russians .PERIOD
Because globalization opens up all kinds of ways for us to undermine and change the way we think about political geography .PERIOD
Remember the 40 dots on the nighttime map that show the hubs of the global economy ?QUESTIONMARK
And now many of you have been reading in the news how people are looking to China to lead the rebound ,COMMA the economic rebound ,COMMA not just in Asia ,COMMA but potentially for the world .PERIOD
So China is becoming the anchor of the economy in the region .PERIOD
China has signed military agreements with many countries in the region .PERIOD
All of this is happening without firing a shot .PERIOD
So what can we do to think about borders differently in this part of the world ?QUESTIONMARK
What I want to present to you is what I call state building ,COMMA day by day .PERIOD
The Kurds for 3000 years have been waging a struggle for independence ,COMMA and now is their chance to finally have it .PERIOD
Now remember Kurdistan is landlocked .PERIOD
And therefore it has to have amicable relations with them .PERIOD
The lesson from Kurdistan and from Palestine is that independence alone ,COMMA without infrastructure ,COMMA is futile .PERIOD
The last time that was the case was actually a century ago ,COMMA during the Ottoman Empire .PERIOD
But today the Hejaz Railway lies in tatters ,COMMA ruins .PERIOD
More pipelines means more silk roads ,COMMA instead of the Great Game .PERIOD
In 2004 ,COMMA 15 new countries joined the EU .PERIOD
Even if these regions aren't part of the EU ,COMMA they are becoming part of its sphere of influence .PERIOD
So what's next ?QUESTIONMARK Where are we going to see borders change and new countries born ?QUESTIONMARK
If we were to look at all of Africa we could most certainly acknowledge far more ,COMMA tribal divisions and so forth .PERIOD
It has three ongoing civil wars ,COMMA the genocide in Darfur ,COMMA which you all know about ,COMMA the civil war in the east of the country ,COMMA and south Sudan .PERIOD
But if you look in nature ,COMMA you see that different kinds of animals can have really different lifespans .PERIOD
Now these animals are different from one another ,COMMA because they have different genes .PERIOD
And we didn't study any of these animals .PERIOD
Is it miserable ?QUESTIONMARK It doesn't seem to be .PERIOD
And if you look at the tissues of the animal ,COMMA they're starting to deteriorate .PERIOD
And now here is the daf- 2 mutant .PERIOD
But it's really more like this :COLON let's say you're a 30 year-old guy -- or in your 30 s -- and you're a bachelor and you're dating people .PERIOD
She says ,COMMA I'm 60 .PERIOD
Well as you know ,COMMA genes ,COMMA which are part of the DNA ,COMMA they're instructions to make a protein that does something .PERIOD
It says that aging is subject to control by the genes ,COMMA and specifically by hormones .PERIOD
So after we made our discoveries with little C .PERIOD elegans ,COMMA people who worked on other kinds of animals started asking ,COMMA if we made the same daf- 2 mutation ,COMMA the hormone receptor mutation ,COMMA in other animals ,COMMA will they live longer ?QUESTIONMARK
They hardly get cancer ,COMMA and when they do it's not as severe .PERIOD
So in a daf- 2 mutant -- you see that I have the X drawn here through the receptor .PERIOD
The receptor isn't working as well .PERIOD
And many of these different genes ,COMMA we've shown ,COMMA actually contribute to the long lifespan of the daf- 2 mutant .PERIOD
Then they promote the uptake of nutrients .PERIOD
So he doesn't actually do anything himself .PERIOD
We don't know the details of how this works ,COMMA but we do know then that FOXO genes can impact the lifespan of people .PERIOD
But in this case ,COMMA there's already a drug called rapamycin that binds to the TOR protein and inhibits its activity .PERIOD
So people take it to prevent organ transplants from being rejected .PERIOD
You could change the genes in principle .PERIOD
So it might be that you would just have to fine tune it very carefully to get the benefits without getting any problems .PERIOD
I wasn't suggesting that I was going to go and do it ,COMMA but .PERIOD
Just move to one side for us ,COMMA if you would .PERIOD
And when you look at these 70 year-old turtles ,COMMA you can't tell the difference ,COMMA just by looking ,COMMA between those turtles and 20 year-old turtles .PERIOD
They're more resistant to these kinds of stresses .PERIOD
They're not getting old in the dog's lifespan .PERIOD
Here's another good article about a new campaign opposing privatization of transit without any contact information for the campaign .PERIOD
The message seems to be that the readers are most likely to want to eat ,COMMA maybe read a book ,COMMA maybe see a movie ,COMMA but not be engaged in their community .PERIOD
They all have heroes who were chosen .PERIOD
This helps me understand why a lot of people have trouble seeing themselves as leaders because it sends all the wrong messages about what leadership is about .PERIOD
As long as we're teaching our kids that heroism starts when someone scratches a mark on your forehead ,COMMA or someone tells you that you're part of a prophecy ,COMMA they're missing the most important characteristic of leadership ,COMMA which is that it comes from within .PERIOD
Which leads us to the last one ,COMMA which is our elections .PERIOD
So I was privileged to train in transplantation under two great surgical pioneers :COLON Thomas Starzl ,COMMA who performed the world's first successful liver transplant in 1967 ,COMMA and Sir Roy Calne ,COMMA who performed the first liver transplant in the UK .PERIOD
in the following year .PERIOD
But not all patients on the transplant wait list are so fortunate .PERIOD
And the gift of life has been extended from brain-dead donors to living ,COMMA related donors -- relatives who might donate an organ or a part of an organ ,COMMA like a split liver graft ,COMMA to a relative or loved one .PERIOD
No doubt ,COMMA I was informed ,COMMA the consent had been obtained .PERIOD
And at that time ,COMMA stem cell research had gained momentum ,COMMA following the isolation of the world's first human embryonic stem cells in the 1990 s .PERIOD
And as it turns out ,COMMA fat is one of the best sources of adult stem cells .PERIOD
If this research is successful ,COMMA it may then reduce the need to research and sacrifice human embryos .PERIOD
It is a fact that when our organs or tissues are injured ,COMMA our bone marrow releases stem cells into our circulation .PERIOD
There are 170 clinical trials investigating the role of stem cells in heart disease .PERIOD
We are very happy because we have the opportunity to have this angel in the world -- not only in our country ,COMMA Venezuela ,COMMA but in our world .PERIOD
He has given us the possibility to have dreams and to make true the dreams .PERIOD
And here are the results of this wonderful project that is The System in Venezuela .PERIOD
He buys a ring ,COMMA she buys a dress .PERIOD
These optimistic young bastards promise to honor and cherish each other through hot flashes and mid-life crises and a cumulative 50 -lb .PERIOD weight gain ,COMMA until that far-off day when one of them is finally able to rest in peace .PERIOD
And some of them will even still be enjoying each others' company when neither of them can chew solid food anymore .PERIOD
What do the folks who make it all the way to side-by-side burial plots have in common ?QUESTIONMARK
And they try to pinpoint what it is that sets them apart from their miserable neighbors and friends .PERIOD
It's obvious that this leads to marital bliss because ,COMMA women ,COMMA we care a great deal about being thin and good looking ,COMMA whereas men mostly care about sex .PERIOD
So instead of all that laborious dieting and exercising ,COMMA we just need to wait for them to get fat ,COMMA maybe bake a few pies .PERIOD
These are couples who can find good in any situation .PERIOD
This is an actual study ,COMMA and let me clarify .PERIOD
Now I don't know how old all of you are ,COMMA but when I was a kid ,COMMA your parents took pictures with a special kind of camera that held something called film ,COMMA and ,COMMA by God ,COMMA film was expensive .PERIOD
I'm serious .PERIOD
So I'm obviously going to need fatten him up .PERIOD
I have a doppelganger .PERIOD
That's exactly what I do -- optical mind control .PERIOD
Even if we could measure what every cell is doing at all times ,COMMA we would still have to make sense of the recorded activity patterns ,COMMA and that's so difficult ,COMMA chances are we'll understand these patterns just as little as the brains that produce them .PERIOD
To make progress ,COMMA we need to break the code .PERIOD
The approach works so well that we can write purely artificial messages directly to the brain .PERIOD
These headless bodies can live for about a day ,COMMA but they don't do much .PERIOD
Now for an intelligent being like our fly ,COMMA this policy is not written in stone but rather changes as the animal learns from experience .PERIOD
So we bred flies whose brains were more or less randomly peppered with cells that were light addressable .PERIOD
Whenever it comes up to the midpoint ,COMMA it pauses ,COMMA it carefully scans the odor interface as if it was sniffing out its environment ,COMMA and then it turns around .PERIOD
These 12 cells ,COMMA as shown here in green ,COMMA send the output to a brain structure called the mushroom body ,COMMA which is shown here in gray .PERIOD
If the connection is strong ,COMMA the motors will turn on and the fly will initiate a turn .PERIOD
In a situation like this ,COMMA we would expect the Critic to speak up and to tell the Actor to change its policy .PERIOD
So the next time the fly finds itself facing the same odor again ,COMMA the connection is strong enough to turn on the motors and to trigger an evasive maneuver .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA in terms of biomimetics ,COMMA as human technologies take on more of the characteristics of nature ,COMMA nature becomes a much more useful teacher .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA being a biologist ,COMMA I was very curious about this .PERIOD
These are gecko toes .PERIOD
And the individual has 2 billion of these nano-size split ends .PERIOD
So what they did was they asked us an important question .PERIOD
They're climbing up a wall ,COMMA or a tree .PERIOD
Now that's real time .PERIOD You can't see anything .PERIOD
So they do it with this active tail as they swing around .PERIOD
Okay ,COMMA there it goes .PERIOD
It oscillates its tail up and down like a dolphin .PERIOD
But watch its front legs .PERIOD Can you see what they are doing ?QUESTIONMARK
So now we were really confused ,COMMA because there are no reports of it gliding .PERIOD
One of the problems is coming up with the right target .PERIOD
There's not a lot of science behind that one either .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA why is this so complicated ?QUESTIONMARK
Volcanoes eject aerosols into the atmosphere .PERIOD
So here's the thing .PERIOD It sounds like a simple question .PERIOD
That's the Ross Sea Ice Shelf on the right there .PERIOD
You can go then and study corals and figure out how often do you see this .PERIOD
And it been growing for about 600 years .PERIOD
You can see some of the coral cores there on the right .PERIOD
That the place where ,COMMA during an earthquake in 1954 ,COMMA this marine terrace was lifted up out of the ocean very quickly ,COMMA and it was lifted up about six to seven meters .PERIOD
And so now you can walk through a coral reef without getting wet .PERIOD
There's a whole family of curves here .PERIOD
Some of the records show lower temperatures than others .PERIOD
And there is natural variability caused by the Sun ,COMMA caused by El Ninos .PERIOD
There's consequences for carbonate organisms .PERIOD
The main framework material of coral reefs is calcium carbonate .PERIOD
And on coral reefs ,COMMA where some of the main framework organisms disappear ,COMMA we will see a major loss of marine biodiversity .PERIOD
You know ,COMMA these are things that we have good physiological reasons to expect to see stressed caused by this transience .PERIOD
You have to go back about 30 million years to find a time when CO 2 levels were double what they are today .PERIOD
That's the reason that they're not able to respond or adapt to this rapid acidification that's going on right now .PERIOD
And I think that may very well be true ,COMMA so I'll close with this .PERIOD
And a long time ago -- well ,COMMA about 40 years ago -- my mom had an exchange student .PERIOD
This is Donna at the Statue of Liberty .PERIOD
But I'd like to talk about another way to travel that doesn't require a ship or an airplane ,COMMA and just requires a movie camera ,COMMA a projector and a screen .PERIOD
And that's what I'm going to talk to you about today .PERIOD
So I'm the living product of two cultures coming together .PERIOD
To change the Arab nightmare into the American dream .PERIOD
Josh Rushing :COLON The night they showed the POWs and the dead soldiers -- Al Jazeera showed them -- it was powerful because America doesn't show those kinds of images .PERIOD
And it upset me on a profound level that I wasn't bothered as much the night before .PERIOD
Jehane Noujaim :COLON I was overwhelmed by the response of the film ,COMMA for we didn't know whether it would be able to get out there .PERIOD
And I saw this with audiences .PERIOD
Man :COLON God forbid !EXCLAMATIONMARK
If you were not Abu Azzam's daughter .PERIOD
In this life ,COMMA we're dead anyway .PERIOD
Woman :COLON Perhaps .PERIOD We have to turn it into a moral war .PERIOD
Zvika :COLON I said ,COMMA OK ,COMMA that's Bat-Chen ,COMMA that's my daughter .PERIOD
Are you sure she is dead ?QUESTIONMARK
When we got to here ,COMMA we saw three Israeli military jeeps parked on the side of the road .PERIOD
George :COLON But there is a teacher that is in charge ?QUESTIONMARK
But after thinking logically about it ,COMMA I didn't find any reason why not to meet them and let them know of our suffering .PERIOD
We see that there are Palestinians who suffered a lot ,COMMA who lost children ,COMMA and still believe in the peace process and in reconciliation .PERIOD
Yes .PERIOD Yes !EXCLAMATIONMARK
But I've been trying to think about ways to give power to these independent voices ,COMMA to give power to the filmmakers ,COMMA to give power to people who are trying to use film for change .PERIOD
There's Just Vision ,COMMA that are working with Palestinians and Israelis who are working together for peace ,COMMA and documenting that process and getting interviews out there and using this film to take to Congress to show that it's a powerful tool to show that this is a woman who's had her daughter killed in an attack ,COMMA and she believes that there are peaceful ways to solve this .PERIOD
There's Working Films and there's Current TV ,COMMA which is an incredible platform for people around the world to be able to put their -- yes ,COMMA it's amazing .PERIOD
There are people that want to be a part of this global day of film ,COMMA to be able to provide a platform for independent voices and independent films to get out there .PERIOD
In the year 1919 ,COMMA a virtually unknown German mathematician ,COMMA named Theodor Kaluza suggested a very bold and ,COMMA in some ways ,COMMA a very bizarre idea .PERIOD
That is in addition to left ,COMMA right ,COMMA back ,COMMA forth and up ,COMMA down ,COMMA Kaluza proposed that there might be additional dimensions of space that for some reason we don't yet see .PERIOD
How is it that the Sun ,COMMA 93 million miles away ,COMMA [that] somehow it affects the motion of the Earth ?QUESTIONMARK
He ,COMMA like Einstein ,COMMA was in search of what we call a unified theory .PERIOD
Maybe I can play the same game with the other known force ,COMMA which was ,COMMA at that time ,COMMA known as the electromagnetic force -- we know of others today ,COMMA but at that time that was the only other one people were thinking about .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA but for those of us who are a little bit more practically minded ,COMMA two questions immediately arise from his observation .PERIOD
It's very hard to see it ,COMMA though ,COMMA from far away .PERIOD
So many people worked on it ,COMMA but by the ' 40 s ,COMMA certainly by the ' 50 s ,COMMA this strange but very compelling idea of how to unify the laws of physics had gone away .PERIOD
In our era ,COMMA a new approach to unify the laws of physics is being pursued by physicists such as myself ,COMMA many others around the world ,COMMA it's called superstring theory ,COMMA as you were indicating .PERIOD
And there you see unification ,COMMA because matter particles ,COMMA electrons and quarks ,COMMA radiation particles ,COMMA photons ,COMMA gravitons ,COMMA are all built up from one entity .PERIOD
One of the other predictions of string theory -- no ,COMMA that's not one of the other predictions of string theory .PERIOD
And that question is this :COLON when we look around the world ,COMMA as scientists have done for the last hundred years ,COMMA there appear to be about 20 numbers that really describe our universe .PERIOD
Not yet .PERIOD
But we believe the answer for why those numbers have the values they do may rely on the form of the extra dimensions .PERIOD
This is an example of something known as a Calabi-Yau shape -- name isn't all that important .PERIOD
But ,COMMA as you can see ,COMMA the extra dimensions fold in on themselves and intertwine in a very interesting shape ,COMMA interesting structure .PERIOD
And the idea is that if this is what the extra dimensions look like ,COMMA then the microscopic landscape of our universe all around us would look like this on the tiniest of scales .PERIOD
And this is an experiment that may test for them in our lifetime .PERIOD
And yet ,COMMA even at this most fundamental level ,COMMA context is everything .PERIOD
And now you see it .PERIOD
There is no a priori reason why an H has to go between that W and A .PERIOD
So you don't do it again .PERIOD
Your brain is learning .PERIOD And it's learning that the right side of its visual field is under red illumination ;SEMICOLON the left side of its visual field is under green illumination .PERIOD
I take it from your response they don't look the same anymore .PERIOD Right ?QUESTIONMARK
Why ?QUESTIONMARK Because if the tile in that shadow were in fact in shadow ,COMMA and reflecting the same amount of light to your eye as the one outside the shadow ,COMMA it would have to be more reflective -- just the laws of physics .PERIOD
Which means we can bring all this information together to create some incredibly strong illusions .PERIOD
And they land on the flower .PERIOD They stick their tongue in there ,COMMA called a proboscis ,COMMA and they drink sugar water .PERIOD
So they are using the relationships between the colors to solve the puzzle ,COMMA which is exactly what we do .PERIOD
So ,COMMA illusions are often used ,COMMA especially in art ,COMMA in the words of a more contemporary artist ,COMMA to demonstrate the fragility of our senses .PERIOD
Instead ,COMMA color tells us something completely different ,COMMA that the brain didn't actually evolve to see the world the way it is .PERIOD
We can't .PERIOD Instead ,COMMA the brain evolved to see the world the way it was useful to see in the past .PERIOD
Well ,COMMA one of the ways we do in my lab and studio is we translate the light into sound and we enable people to hear their visual world .PERIOD
So ,COMMA working with kids ,COMMA they created images ,COMMA thinking about what might the images you see sound like if we could listen to them .PERIOD
So ,COMMA now ,COMMA what I want to do :COLON I'm going to put the middle nine surfaces here under yellow illumination by simply putting a filter behind them .PERIOD
The question is ,COMMA Is that an illusion ?QUESTIONMARK
And they're different .PERIOD
And you can make your own decision ,COMMA and then you'll decide whether the invasion was worth it .PERIOD
That's how you think about security -- in terms of the trade-off .PERIOD
I'll give you the short answer .PERIOD
Now most of the time ,COMMA that works .PERIOD
We've developed this ability because it makes evolutionary sense .PERIOD
The unknown is perceived to be riskier than the familiar .PERIOD
If you hear a lot about tiger attacks ,COMMA there must be a lot of tigers around .PERIOD
When something is so common ,COMMA it's no longer news -- car crashes ,COMMA domestic violence -- those are the risks you worry about .PERIOD
There's no real word for stuff that makes us secure ,COMMA but doesn't make us feel secure .PERIOD
And there are two ways to do this .PERIOD
Enough real world examples helps .PERIOD
Security theater's exposed when it's obvious that it's not working properly .PERIOD
If ,COMMA for example ,COMMA terrorism almost never happens ,COMMA it's really hard to judge the efficacy of counter-terrorist measures .PERIOD
It doesn't change ;SEMICOLON it's real .PERIOD
We couldn't have a germ theory of disease before we invented the microscope to see them .PERIOD
Where do we get these models ?QUESTIONMARK We get them from others .PERIOD
Think of models of terrorism ,COMMA child kidnapping ,COMMA airline safety ,COMMA car safety .PERIOD
Models can come from industry .PERIOD
For us ,COMMA we're very facile around electricity .PERIOD
Now it had a name ,COMMA which made it scarier than the regular flu ,COMMA even though it was more deadly .PERIOD
As the novelty wore off ,COMMA the months went by ,COMMA there was some amount of tolerance ,COMMA people got used to it .PERIOD
We have feeling ,COMMA model ,COMMA reality .PERIOD
New models that extend long periods of time are hard .PERIOD
Global warming is a great example .PERIOD
Strong feelings can create a model .PERIOD
And that's okay .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA what we want is people to get familiar enough with better models -- have it reflected in their feelings -- to allow them to make security trade-offs .PERIOD
Remember I said feeling ,COMMA model ,COMMA reality ;SEMICOLON I said reality doesn't change .PERIOD It actually does .PERIOD
Someone else bought it and died .PERIOD
All human life ,COMMA all life ,COMMA depends on plants .PERIOD
And plants sometimes find it rather difficult to move because there might be cities and other things in the way .PERIOD
So if all human life depends on plants ,COMMA doesn't it make sense that perhaps we should try to save them ?QUESTIONMARK
All the genetic information for future generations of plants are held in seeds .PERIOD
So all around the world people are doing the same thing .PERIOD
This is at least 100 times bigger .PERIOD
How much does it cost ?QUESTIONMARK
The future research is How can we find the genetic and molecular markers for the viability of seeds ,COMMA without having to plant them every 10 years ?QUESTIONMARK
And it was found close to here ,COMMA Stanford .PERIOD
Some lasted 14 -and-a-half minutes .PERIOD
Couldn't do it .PERIOD Could not wait .PERIOD
Put it back .PERIOD
They would walk around .PERIOD They would play with their skirts and pants .PERIOD
The sales person that -- the customer says ,COMMA I want that .PERIOD And the person says ,COMMA Okay ,COMMA here you are .PERIOD
Then you sell a lot more .PERIOD
The rules of engagement :COLON how to talk ,COMMA when to talk ,COMMA and how to deal with them .PERIOD
We just have to persevere .PERIOD
Everybody seems to agree with that .PERIOD
But now ,COMMA as we prepare to talk ,COMMA we understand how little we know .PERIOD
Should we talk to Hamas ?QUESTIONMARK
Now my diplomats are instructed to talk to all these groups .PERIOD
But talking can be done in different ways .PERIOD
We make a distinction between talking from a diplomatic level and talking at the political level .PERIOD
In his memoirs ,COMMA Long Road to Freedom ,COMMA he wrote that he survived during those years of captivity because he always decided to look upon his oppressor as also being a human being ,COMMA also being a human being .PERIOD
Now South African friends will know that was very painful .PERIOD
Dialogue is not easy -- not between individuals ,COMMA not between groups ,COMMA not between governments -- but it is very necessary .PERIOD
But that strategy seldom takes you very far .PERIOD
We could never have done the convention against anti-personnel landmines and the convention that is banning cluster munitions unless we had done diplomacy differently ,COMMA by engaging with civil society .PERIOD
How are we going to solve climate change through negotiations ,COMMA unless we are able to make civil society and people ,COMMA not part of the problem ,COMMA but part of the solution ?QUESTIONMARK
What is the legitimacy of diplomacy ,COMMA of the the solution we devise as diplomats if they cannot be reflected and understood by also these broader forces of societies that we now very loosely call groups ?QUESTIONMARK
The diplomatic toolbox is actually full of different tools we can use to strengthen our communication .PERIOD
In my country ,COMMA I have seen how the council of Islamist groups and Christian groups came together ,COMMA not as a government initiative ,COMMA but they came together on their own initiative to establish contact and dialogue in times where things were pretty low-key tension .PERIOD
How are we going to settle and build a bigger We to deal with our issues if we don't improve our skills of communication ?QUESTIONMARK
So ,COMMA I'm in Chile ,COMMA in the Atacama desert ,COMMA sitting in a hotel lobby ,COMMA because that's the only place that I can get a Wi-Fi connection ,COMMA and I have this picture up on my screen ,COMMA and a woman comes up behind me .PERIOD
And ,COMMA you know ,COMMA Excuse me !EXCLAMATIONMARK
This is a Gentoo penguin .PERIOD And she was still skeptical .PERIOD
So ,COMMA one of the things that I love to do is travel around the world and look at archaeological sites .PERIOD
And ,COMMA one thing that isn't a mystery ,COMMA actually ,COMMA was when I grew up -- because when I was a little kid ,COMMA I'd seen these pictures -- and I thought ,COMMA Well ,COMMA why that look on the face ?QUESTIONMARK
In fact ,COMMA in many of the statues ,COMMA when you excavate them ,COMMA the backs are totally smooth -- almost glass smooth .PERIOD
We're trying to get all of the permissions to get everything all set ,COMMA to get it going .PERIOD
In this case ,COMMA we're working with a major medical foundation to develop inexpensive ways of diagnosing diseases in developing countries .PERIOD
Various parts of the world will have a cult food that people get enormously attached to -- there's tremendous traditions ,COMMA there's secrecy .PERIOD
And I'm trying to use a very scientific approach .PERIOD
So ,COMMA I do a lot of work on dinosaurs .PERIOD
Not the same one ,COMMA actually .PERIOD This is a cast ,COMMA which I had bought ,COMMA and then ,COMMA after buying the cast ,COMMA I found my own ,COMMA and I don't have room for two .PERIOD
It's something that can inform all sorts of science in unexpected ways .PERIOD
These days ,COMMA bits are cheap .PERIOD Unfortunately ,COMMA that means you've got to spend more time sorting through them .PERIOD
Then ,COMMA a little bit later ,COMMA I start getting some pictures like this .PERIOD
That's kind of what it's like .PERIOD
And you know ,COMMA when I was at Microsoft ,COMMA that was so engrossing ,COMMA and the whole industry was expanding so much ,COMMA that it did tend to crowd out most of the other things in my life .PERIOD
The sound made flicking a wall switch off is of a completely different nature .PERIOD
Or the recorded crowing of a rooster ?QUESTIONMARK
That's the end of that .PERIOD
Take-out sandwich shops ,COMMA film processing drop-offs ,COMMA peep-shows and necktie stores .PERIOD
You were late for school again this morning .PERIOD
We have fading memories of that provisional temple ,COMMA erected each time an adult sat down .PERIOD
The next story is called The Haverpiece Collection A nondescript warehouse ,COMMA visible for a moment from the northbound lanes of the Prykushko Expressway ,COMMA serves as the temporary resting place for the Haverpiece collection of European dried fruit .PERIOD
Do you remember wandering as a child through those dark wooden storefront galleries ?QUESTIONMARK
A shoe made of apricot leather for the daughter of a czar .PERIOD
And that this ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA will be the way that we treat cancer in the future .PERIOD
It is very useful in certain circumstances .PERIOD
It's the one theory that the biologists ever really got right .PERIOD
You predict a black hole ,COMMA and you look out the telescope and there it is ,COMMA just like you said .PERIOD
And so we can discover things that probably you could have found by looking at enough of your relatives ,COMMA but they may be surprising .PERIOD
And Applied Minds gets a lot of calls from people who want help with their problems ,COMMA and I didn't think this was a very likely one to call back ,COMMA so I kept on giving him to the delay list .PERIOD
And I'll show you what that protein measurement looks like .PERIOD
We sort out the proteins -- from left to right is the weight of the fragments that we're getting ,COMMA and from top to bottom is how slippery they are .PERIOD
And you can see how the lines occur in these little groups of bump ,COMMA bump ,COMMA bump ,COMMA bump ,COMMA bump .PERIOD
And many people in this audience probably wouldn't be alive if doctors didn't do this .PERIOD
Well ,COMMA it's in the kitchen .PERIOD Oh ,COMMA you must have kitchen water .PERIOD
So your house is dealing with leaks all the time ,COMMA but it's fixing them .PERIOD It's draining them out and so on .PERIOD
And so I gave this talk and said ,COMMA Why don't you guys do this ?QUESTIONMARK
But design a program of treatments specifically for you and help your body guide back to health -- guide your body back to health .PERIOD
So thank you very much .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA I want to tell you a quick story .PERIOD
Super Bowl .PERIOD I heard it over here .PERIOD It was the date of the Super Bowl .PERIOD
And there were even some polls that were saying she was going to go all the way .PERIOD
But when we talked to people ,COMMA it appeared that a funnel effect had happened in these tribes all across the United States .PERIOD
But not just work .PERIOD It's within these tribes that societies get built ,COMMA that important things happen .PERIOD
If you focus in on a group like this -- this happens to be a USC game -- and you zoom in with one of those super satellite cameras and do magnification factors so you could see individual people ,COMMA you would in fact see not a single crowd ,COMMA just like there is not a single crowd here ,COMMA but you would see these tribes that are then coming together .PERIOD
Not all tribes are the same ,COMMA and what makes the difference is the culture .PERIOD
This is the kid who shot up Virginia Tech .PERIOD
So ,COMMA this other book that Steve mentioned ,COMMA that just came out ,COMMA called The Three Laws of Performance ,COMMA my colleague ,COMMA Steve Zaffron and I ,COMMA argue that as people see the world ,COMMA so they behave .PERIOD
Well ,COMMA if people see the world in such a way that life sucks ,COMMA then their behavior will follow automatically from that .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA my birthday is coming up shortly ,COMMA and my driver's license expires .PERIOD
The amount of world-changing behavior that would happen ?QUESTIONMARK
A whole group of people communicating that way ,COMMA talking that way .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA we find these in places where really smart ,COMMA successful people show up .PERIOD
It was not Christmas time .PERIOD There was a Christmas tree .PERIOD
There is ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA another stage .PERIOD
There was no road map .PERIOD No one had ever done anything like this before .PERIOD
And people ,COMMA at the time ,COMMA feared that South Africa would end up going the way that Rwanda has gone ,COMMA descending into one skirmish after another in a civil war that seems to have no end .PERIOD
What about Martin Luther King ?QUESTIONMARK
In fact ,COMMA Martin Luther King's most famous line was at Stage Three .PERIOD
48 percent of working tribes say ,COMMA these are employed tribes ,COMMA say ,COMMA I'm great and you're not .PERIOD
But you don't leave them where you found them .PERIOD Okay ?QUESTIONMARK
I don't know anybody .PERIOD
We move people from Stage One to Stage Two by getting them in a new tribe and then ,COMMA over time ,COMMA getting them connected .PERIOD
But we're not done yet .PERIOD Because then how do we go from Stage Four ,COMMA which is great ,COMMA to Stage Five ?QUESTIONMARK
Incidentally ,COMMA they did pull it off .PERIOD
And they released the first-ever world poll .PERIOD
We're here to celebrate compassion .PERIOD
But kindness is an everyday byproduct of all the great virtues .PERIOD
And in that light ,COMMA for the religious ,COMMA compassion also brings us into the territory of mystery -- encouraging us not just to see beauty ,COMMA but perhaps also to look for the face of God in the moment of suffering ,COMMA in the face of a stranger ,COMMA in the face of the vibrant religious other .PERIOD
The communities that Jean Vanier founded ,COMMA like Jean Vanier himself ,COMMA exude tenderness .PERIOD
And compassion can also have those qualities .PERIOD
And compassion is unleashed in wider and wider circles by signs and stories ,COMMA never by statistics and strategies .PERIOD
Rachel Naomi Remen says this is an important and empowering story for our time ,COMMA because this story insists that each and every one of us ,COMMA frail and flawed as we may be ,COMMA inadequate as we may feel ,COMMA has exactly what's needed to help repair the part of the world that we can see and touch .PERIOD
This is going to change science ,COMMA I believe ,COMMA and it will change religion .PERIOD
Einstein believed deeply that science should transcend national and ethnic divisions .PERIOD
But he watched physicists and chemists become the purveyors of weapons of mass destruction in the early 20 th century .PERIOD
So in this photograph you see a mind looking out a window at what might be a cathedral -- it's not .PERIOD
Thank you .PERIOD
Camp was more like a keg party without any alcohol .PERIOD
And it went like this :COLON R-O-W-D-I-E ,COMMA that's the way we spell rowdie .PERIOD
And I just waited for the time that I could go off and read my books .PERIOD
And I was always going off to crowded bars when I really would have preferred to just have a nice dinner with friends .PERIOD
So even if you're an extrovert yourself ,COMMA I'm talking about your coworkers and your spouses and your children and the person sitting next to you right now -- all of them subject to this bias that is pretty deep and real in our society .PERIOD
Shyness is about fear of social judgment .PERIOD
So the key then to maximizing our talents is for us all to put ourselves in the zone of stimulation that is right for us .PERIOD
And also we have this belief system right now that I call the new groupthink ,COMMA which holds that all creativity and all productivity comes from a very oddly gregarious place .PERIOD
And the vast majority of teachers reports believing that the ideal student is an extrovert as opposed to an introvert ,COMMA even though introverts actually get better grades and are more knowledgeable ,COMMA according to research .PERIOD
Now I think at this point it's important for me to say that I actually love extroverts .PERIOD
The same religions who send their sages off to lonely mountain tops also teach us love and trust .PERIOD
Here's Margaret Atwood ,COMMA Cat's Eye .PERIOD
But here's the thing about my grandfather .PERIOD
It was my version of my grandfather's hours of the day alone in his library .PERIOD
And I call this my year of speaking dangerously .PERIOD
But we need much more privacy and much more freedom and much more autonomy at work .PERIOD
We need to be teaching kids to work together ,COMMA for sure ,COMMA but we also need to be teaching them how to work on their own .PERIOD
And that's okay .PERIOD
Then ,COMMA about the initiative that Chris mentioned ,COMMA that we decided to launch at AMD that we call 50 x 15 .PERIOD
He explained to me about Johann Strauss ,COMMA and how he created the waltzes that became so famous in the world .PERIOD
That's year by year .PERIOD This comes from our friends at Gapmindercom .PERIOD
So ,COMMA we talked about ways in which perhaps one could partner to be able to bring the cost of this technology down .PERIOD
And frankly -- and I know that sometimes I offend some of my customers when I say this ,COMMA but I truly mean it -- if you could take the name of the computer off the top of it ,COMMA it would be very difficult to judge who made it ,COMMA because they're all highly commoditized but they're all different .PERIOD
And the last piece ,COMMA which is really important -- and this is an opinion that we have ,COMMA not shared by many ,COMMA this is one where we seem to stand alone ,COMMA on this one -- is that we really believe that the greatest success of this initiative can come by fostering local ,COMMA integrated ,COMMA end-to-end ecosystems .PERIOD
We just recently opened a learning laboratory in a school in the West Cape in South Africa ,COMMA in a school that's called Nelson Mandela School ,COMMA and when you see the faces and activities of these children being able to access computers ,COMMA it's just phenomenal .PERIOD
And we're really thrilled about the opportunity to be part of this ,COMMA and can't wait to see what comes out of this exciting ,COMMA exciting activity .PERIOD
I'll tell you that one of the things that I feel is really critical for us in industry ,COMMA in business ,COMMA is to be able to be passionate about solving these problems .PERIOD
I was eager to go off to college ,COMMA and go find girls ,COMMA and study ,COMMA and girls ,COMMA and study ,COMMA but then I finished college and I fell in love .PERIOD
And on my wedding day ,COMMA my father came to me again and said ,COMMA You know ,COMMA I'm going to remind you again ,COMMA that each generation has to do better than the last one .PERIOD
Just existing .PERIOD
I really think that's there's this inner desire .PERIOD
And all of a sudden ,COMMA it brought a lot of money and a lot of attention .PERIOD
That's kind of a no-brainer .PERIOD
So ,COMMA what is it for ?QUESTIONMARK
So I believe ,COMMA essentially ,COMMA that leadership is stewardship .PERIOD
This is not my planet .PERIOD It wasn't mine before I was born .PERIOD
Do you think we have a stewardship here ,COMMA to take the environment seriously ?QUESTIONMARK
What we believe ,COMMA obviously -- and you know this -- determines our behavior ,COMMA and our behavior determines what we become in life .PERIOD
My wife and I first made five decisions on what to do with the money .PERIOD
We just said ,COMMA we're not going to use it on us .PERIOD
Believe me ,COMMA there's a whole lot easier ways to make money .PERIOD
The last thing we did is we became what I call reverse tithers .PERIOD
And that is ,COMMA when my wife and I got married 30 years ago ,COMMA we started tithing .PERIOD
Materialism is all about getting -- get ,COMMA get ,COMMA get ,COMMA get all you can ,COMMA can all you get ,COMMA sit on the can and spoil the rest .PERIOD
And we think that the good life is actually looking good -- that's most important of all -- looking good ,COMMA feeling good and having the goods .PERIOD
There's a chapter in the Bible called Psalm 72 ,COMMA and it's Solomon's prayer for more influence .PERIOD
Basically ,COMMA he's talking about all the marginalized in society .PERIOD
It's a shepherd's staff .PERIOD
And ,COMMA by the way ,COMMA my God doesn't have to show up on cheese bread .PERIOD
You know ,COMMA if God's going to show up ,COMMA He's not going to show up on cheese bread .PERIOD
But He doesn't do miracles just to show off .PERIOD
What do you do with a shepherd's staff ?QUESTIONMARK
You pull them or you poke them ,COMMA one or the other .PERIOD
And it represents your influence .PERIOD
And that gives with you enormous influence .PERIOD
What are you doing with what you've been given ?QUESTIONMARK
Why would God wire you to do something and then not have you do it ?QUESTIONMARK
And in some countries -- let me pick Afghanistan -- 75 percent of the little girls don't go to school .PERIOD
So in the three years since I talked at TED and showed a prototype ,COMMA it's gone from an idea to a real laptop .PERIOD
We have about a quarter of a million in transit to those and other children ,COMMA and then there are another quarter of a million more that are being ordered at this moment .PERIOD
And that engine is going to see the results in 20 years .PERIOD
They own the laptops .PERIOD They take them home .PERIOD
And the reason she brought her mother is that this six-year-old child had been teaching her mother how to read and write .PERIOD
So it's 1995 ,COMMA I'm in college ,COMMA and a friend and I go on a road trip from Providence ,COMMA Rhode Island to Portland ,COMMA Oregon .PERIOD
We get it in the abstract .PERIOD
But the thing is ,COMMA the coyote runs off the cliff right after him .PERIOD
That's when he falls .PERIOD
This is not mine ,COMMA by the way .PERIOD
We learn these really bad lessons really well .PERIOD
When the vice president for health care quality at Beth Israel spoke about this incident ,COMMA he said something very interesting .PERIOD
And yeah ,COMMA it is also why we get things wrong .PERIOD
I just imagined it everywhere ,COMMA which has happened .PERIOD
And the crypto-theme is :COLON 'I thought this one thing was going to happen and something else happened instead' And the thing is ,COMMA says Ira Glass ,COMMA we need this .PERIOD
But ,COMMA you know ,COMMA our stories are like this because our lives are like this .PERIOD
And something else happened instead .PERIOD
Because half the stuff that's the most mind-boggling and world-altering -- TED 1998 -- eh .PERIOD
We come up with another idea .PERIOD
Bioenergy isn't global warming .PERIOD Bioenergy is something which seems counterintuitive .PERIOD Bioenergy is oil .PERIOD It's gas .PERIOD It's coal .PERIOD And part of building that bridge to the future ,COMMA to the point where we can actually see the oceans in a rational way ,COMMA or put up these geo-spatial orbits that will twirl or do microwaves or stuff ,COMMA is going to depend on how we understand bioenergy and manage it .PERIOD And to do that ,COMMA you really have to look first at agriculture .PERIOD
Maybe that's one of the reasons why if you fly over west Texas ,COMMA the types of wells that you're beginning to see don't look unlike those pictures of Kansas and those irrigated plots .PERIOD
Which is curious as we debate all this stuff .PERIOD But as you think of coal ,COMMA this is what burned wheat kernels look like .PERIOD Not entirely unlike coal .PERIOD
That is what bioenergy is .PERIOD It is not ethanol .PERIOD It is not subsidies to a few companies .PERIOD It is not importing corn into Iowa because you've built so many of these ethanol plants .PERIOD It is beginning to understand the transition that occurred in agriculture ,COMMA from brute force into biological force .PERIOD And in the measure that you can do that ,COMMA you can clean some stuff ,COMMA and you can clean it pretty quickly .PERIOD
But in the meantime ,COMMA for the next decade at least ,COMMA the name of the game is hydrocarbons .PERIOD And be that oil ,COMMA be that gas ,COMMA be that coal ,COMMA this is what we're dealing with .PERIOD And before I make this talk too long ,COMMA here's what's happening in the current energy system .PERIOD
86 percent of the energy we consume are hydrocarbons .PERIOD That means 86 percent of the stuff we're consuming are probably processed plants and amoebas and the rest of the stuff .PERIOD And there's a role in here for conservation .PERIOD There's a role in here for alternative stuff ,COMMA but we've also got to get that other portion right .PERIOD
And what gave her inspiration and meaning was the fact that she was taking care of people who were far away from home .PERIOD
In the wake of the dotcom crash and 9 / 11 ,COMMA San Francisco Bay Area hotels went through the largest percentage revenue drop in the history of American hotels .PERIOD
And I initially ended up in the business section of the bookstore looking for a business solution .PERIOD
Each of us ,COMMA no matter what our role is in business ,COMMA has some hierarchy of needs in the workplace .PERIOD
So as I started reading more Maslow ,COMMA what I started to realize is that Maslow ,COMMA later in his life ,COMMA wanted to take this hierarchy for the individual and apply it to the collective ,COMMA to organizations and specifically to business .PERIOD
But as we started asking ourselves about how we were addressing the higher needs of our employees and our customers ,COMMA I realized we had no metrics .PERIOD
So I went out and studied a bunch of things ,COMMA and I found a survey that showed that 94 percent of business leaders worldwide believe that the intangibles are important in their business ,COMMA things like intellectual property ,COMMA their corporate culture ,COMMA their brand loyalty ,COMMA and yet ,COMMA only five percent of those same leaders actually had a means of measuring the intangibles in their business .PERIOD
And he's a very wise man ,COMMA and he said ,COMMA Listen ,COMMA Bhutan's goal is not to create happiness .PERIOD
One of those key indicators is :COLON How do the Bhutanese feel about how they spend their time each day ?QUESTIONMARK
Or in other words ,COMMA I think the Bhutanese believe happiness equals wanting what you have -- imagine gratitude -- divided by having what you want -- gratification .PERIOD
So it suggests that the momentum is shifting .PERIOD
As you look at these two columns here ,COMMA doesn't it make you feel like it's time for us to start figuring out a new way to count ,COMMA a new way to imagine what's important to us in life ?QUESTIONMARK
We're spending 10 billion dollars on the census .PERIOD
We're asking 10 simple questions -- it is simplicity .PERIOD
They're about demographics .PERIOD
Abe Maslow said long ago something you've heard before ,COMMA but you didn't realize it was him .PERIOD
He said ,COMMA If the only tool you have is a hammer ,COMMA everything starts to look like a nail .PERIOD
In Vivian's case ,COMMA her unit of production isn't the tangible hours she works ,COMMA it's the intangible difference she makes during that one hour of work .PERIOD
He stayed there a hundred times in the last 20 years ,COMMA and he's loyal to the property because of the relationship that Vivian and her fellow employees have created with him .PERIOD
We don't have to choose between inspired employees and sizable profits ,COMMA we can have both .PERIOD
At least ,COMMA as he wrote ,COMMA when a robot dies ,COMMA you don't have to write a letter to its mother .PERIOD
The US .PERIOD is currently ahead in military robotics right now ,COMMA but we know that in technology there's no such thing as a permanent first move or advantage .PERIOD
There's already a jihadi website that you can go on and remotely detonate an IED in Iraq while sitting at your home computer .PERIOD
Soldiers have a name for these clips .PERIOD
The typical one that I was sent was an email that had an attachment of video of a Predator strike taking out an enemy site .PERIOD Missile hits ,COMMA bodies burst into the air with the explosion .PERIOD
It was set to music .PERIOD
And so we kind of have this kind of moral feel-good moment .PERIOD
That bottle winds up getting burned .PERIOD
And so poor people who are making these products in petrochemical centers like Cancer Alley ,COMMA poor people who are consuming these products disproportionately ,COMMA and then poor people ,COMMA who even at the tail end of the recycling are having their lives shortened ,COMMA are all being harmed greatly by this addiction that we have to disposability .PERIOD
Now you think to yourself -- because I know how you are -- you say ,COMMA That sure is terrible for those poor people .PERIOD
It's just awful ,COMMA those poor people .PERIOD
I hope someone does something to help them .PERIOD
But guess what ?QUESTIONMARK
We don't have disposable resources .PERIOD
And as we all begin to come back to that basic understanding ,COMMA new opportunities for action begin to emerge .PERIOD
But if we want to make something hard ,COMMA we come up ,COMMA I know ,COMMA I'm going to make a hard substance .PERIOD
We just had this vote ,COMMA and everybody's like ,COMMA Well ,COMMA not in our state .PERIOD
Just so proud .PERIOD
But California ,COMMA though we lead the world in some of the green stuff ,COMMA we also ,COMMA unfortunately ,COMMA lead the world in some of the gulag stuff .PERIOD
We have a moral challenge in this moment .PERIOD
And really ,COMMA they fundamentally told you ,COMMA Are you going to hug a tree ,COMMA or are you going to hug a child ?QUESTIONMARK Pick .PERIOD
Well ,COMMA when you start working on issues like plastic ,COMMA you realize that the whole thing is connected ,COMMA and luckily most of us are blessed to have two arms .PERIOD
They'd worn themselves out ,COMMA beating themselves against the window ,COMMA and ,COMMA well ,COMMA they were easy to capture .PERIOD
I've called this vehicle ,COMMA generically ,COMMA a volantor ,COMMA after the Latin word volant ,COMMA meaning ,COMMA to fly in a light ,COMMA nimble manner .PERIOD
Volantor-like helicopter ,COMMA perhaps .PERIOD
The press calls my particular volantor a Skycar .PERIOD
One could say that a helicopter does pretty much what the hummingbird does ,COMMA and gets around in much the same way ,COMMA and it's true ,COMMA but a helicopter is a very complex device .PERIOD
Because if you're in this world ,COMMA where computers are controlling what you're doing ,COMMA it's going to be very critical that something can't fail on you .PERIOD
Well ,COMMA you can't right now take off from your home because it's too noisy .PERIOD
I mean to be able to take off from your home ,COMMA you'd have to be extremely quiet .PERIOD
After all ,COMMA if you can fly like that ,COMMA why are you going to drive around on a highway ?QUESTIONMARK
You can play computer games ,COMMA you can sleep ,COMMA you can read on the way .PERIOD
And then through the various years we invented various vehicles .PERIOD
Redundancy is the critical issue here .PERIOD
If you want to stay alive you've got to have backups .PERIOD
that's a very significant incentive for getting out of San Francisco .PERIOD
But you better be the first one out of town as the real estate values go to hell .PERIOD
There's an interesting poll that came out recently under NAS -- I think it's MSNBC -- in which they asked the question ,COMMA Are you in the market for a volantor ?QUESTIONMARK
I mean ,COMMA think about how much we love this .PERIOD
Think about that .PERIOD
What Dr .PERIOD Soljacic figured out how to do was separate the coils in a transformer to a greater distance than the size of those transformers using this technology ,COMMA which is not dissimilar from the way an opera singer shatters a glass on the other side of the room .PERIOD
And what I'm going to do is to show you pretty much what's here .PERIOD
And if the demo gods are willing ,COMMA in about 10 seconds or so we should see it .PERIOD
Think about it .PERIOD You don't want those ugly cords coming down .PERIOD
Imagine if you can get rid of it .PERIOD
And I'll do it again ,COMMA just for safety's sake .PERIOD
We're an equal opportunity designer of this sort of thing .PERIOD
It runs the Android operating system .PERIOD
So we put a little sleeve on the back ,COMMA but we should be able to get this guy to wake up too .PERIOD
And think of what that would do for you .PERIOD
And third ,COMMA our bodies are filters and storehouses for environmental toxins .PERIOD
If you're cremated ,COMMA all those toxins I mentioned are released into the atmosphere .PERIOD
So by trying to preserve our dead bodies ,COMMA we deny death ,COMMA poison the living and further harm the environment .PERIOD
I realize this is not the kind of relationship that we usually aspire to have with our food .PERIOD
The Decompiculture Society shares a vision of a cultural shift ,COMMA from our current culture of death denial and body preservation to one of decompiculture ,COMMA a radical acceptance of death and decomposition .PERIOD
So the Virtual Earth initiative ,COMMA and other types of these initiatives ,COMMA are all about extending our current search metaphor .PERIOD
Well ,COMMA a little unknown secret is his brother actually works on the Virtual Earth team .PERIOD
When we think about how all this comes together ,COMMA it's all about software ,COMMA algorithms and math .PERIOD
We do this all through software ,COMMA algorithms and math -- a highly automated pipeline creating these cities .PERIOD
But what we've found is they like the fluidity of the 3 -D model .PERIOD
I'm going to use these two countries to make an economic argument for democracy ,COMMA rather than against democracy .PERIOD
Look at the skyline of Shanghai .PERIOD
The picture on India is the Dharavi slum of Mumbai in India .PERIOD
In an interview printed in the financial press of India ,COMMA He said that he wants to make Mumbai another Shanghai .PERIOD
This is an Oxford-trained economist steeped in humanistic values ,COMMA and yet he agrees with the high-pressure tactics of Shanghai .PERIOD
This is a very little known fact about the two countries .PERIOD
The economy grows ,COMMA government accumulates more resources ,COMMA and the government can invest in infrastructure -- rather than infrastructure being a cause for economic growth .PERIOD
One reason is the East Asian Model .PERIOD
Korea succeeded ,COMMA North Korea didn't .PERIOD
Burma didn't succeed .PERIOD
In China ,COMMA it's all women .PERIOD
By looking at these two pictures ,COMMA I say no ,COMMA it won't overtake China for a while .PERIOD
Actually ,COMMA the answer is more nuanced and subtle than that .PERIOD
Indira Gandhi declared emergency rule in 1975 .PERIOD
Why do many people believe that India is still a growth disaster ?QUESTIONMARK
But China is a superstar in terms of economic growth .PERIOD
This is the Grand Cafe here in Oxford .PERIOD
That's its great claim to fame ,COMMA and I wanted to show it to you ,COMMA not because I want to give you the kind of Starbucks tour of historic England ,COMMA but rather because the English coffeehouse was crucial to the development and spread of one of the great intellectual flowerings of the last 500 years ,COMMA what we now call the Enlightenment .PERIOD
What are the environments that lead to unusual levels of innovation ,COMMA unusual levels of creativity ?QUESTIONMARK
And this is what they ended up coming with .PERIOD
It's called a neonurture device .PERIOD
In the inside ,COMMA it's all car parts .PERIOD
It's got a fan ,COMMA it's got headlights for warmth ,COMMA it's got door chimes for alarm -- it runs off a car battery .PERIOD
This is Hogarth's famous painting of a kind of political dinner at a tavern ,COMMA but this is what the coffee shops looked like back then .PERIOD
And one of the problems with this is that people are actually -- when you research this field -- people are notoriously unreliable ,COMMA when they actually kind of self-report on where they have their own good ideas ,COMMA or their history of their best ideas .PERIOD
So when they were sitting in front of the microscope ,COMMA when they were talking to their colleague at the water cooler ,COMMA and all these things .PERIOD
But that's a key thing .PERIOD
And so they ask around to a couple of their colleagues ,COMMA and everybody's like ,COMMA No ,COMMA I hadn't thought of doing that .PERIOD
And so Guier and Weiffenbach go back to Weiffenbach's office ,COMMA and they start kind of noodling around -- hacking ,COMMA as we might call it now .PERIOD
We should record it .PERIOD
And they thought about it and they said ,COMMA Well ,COMMA I guess maybe you could .PERIOD Let's run the numbers here .PERIOD
And I bet you one of you ,COMMA if not more ,COMMA has used said device and said satellite system to locate a nearby coffeehouse somewhere in the last -- in the last day or last week ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK
Chance favors the connected mind .PERIOD
My story starts way before I was born .PERIOD
They got on and didn't know where they were going ,COMMA and ended up in Canada .PERIOD
I was 14 ,COMMA and I emailed professors at the local university to see if maybe I could go work in their lab .PERIOD And hardly anyone responded .PERIOD
And so I thought ,COMMA Maybe if it can promote cell growth ,COMMA it can inhibit cell death ,COMMA too .PERIOD
And so that's the project that I pursued for that year ,COMMA and it's continuing now as well ,COMMA and found that a specific purine derivative called guanidine had inhibited the cell growth by approximately 60 percent .PERIOD
But I'd heard of cancer as the most feared disease of our time ,COMMA so how did the good and bad go together ?QUESTIONMARK
And while I was doing this ,COMMA I was reading the cancer literature ,COMMA trying to -- again -- familiarize myself with this new medical field .PERIOD
And it was really interesting -- there were articles correlating if you have a bone fracture ,COMMA and then bone cancer arises .PERIOD
It hasn't yet become fine-tuned enough to finish what has been initiated .PERIOD
If we eliminate cancer the way we're trying to do now ,COMMA with chemotherapy and radiation ,COMMA we're bombarding the body or the cancer with toxins ,COMMA or with radiation ,COMMA trying to kill it .PERIOD
We're removing the cancer cells ,COMMA but we're revealing the previous damage that the body has tried to fix .PERIOD
So ,COMMA this really changed my view of looking at cancer .PERIOD
And what metastases are is when the tumor -- when a piece -- breaks off and travels through the blood stream and goes to a different organ .PERIOD That's what a metastasis is .PERIOD
But then again ,COMMA this fact that the metastases didn't go to skeletal muscle made that seem unlikely .PERIOD
And I guess I'll keep investigating until I get the answers .PERIOD
Is it possible that muscle somehow intuitively knows that it needs this blood supply ?QUESTIONMARK It needs to be constantly contracting ,COMMA so therefore it's almost selfish .PERIOD It's grabbing its blood vessels for itself .PERIOD
And I hate to say that .PERIOD But it seems as though muscle cell ,COMMA possibly because of all its use ,COMMA has adapted faster than other body tissues to respond to injury ,COMMA to fine-tune this repair response and actually be able to finish the process which the body wants to finish .PERIOD I really believe that the human body is very ,COMMA very smart ,COMMA and we can't counteract something the body is saying to do .PERIOD
And again ,COMMA some of these may be far-fetched ,COMMA but I figured if there's anywhere to present far-fetched ideas ,COMMA it's here at TED ,COMMA so thank you very much .PERIOD
Some of you have heard the story before ,COMMA but ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA there's somebody in the audience who's never heard this story -- in front of an audience -- before ,COMMA so I'm a little more nervous than I normally am telling this story .PERIOD
And then ,COMMA my translator left .PERIOD
They slept on the floor at night .PERIOD
I had photographed ,COMMA as I said ,COMMA a lot of these kids .PERIOD
Again ,COMMA not at all shy or withdrawn ,COMMA or anything like the other children that I'd photographed .PERIOD
It was very obvious ,COMMA from the very beginning ,COMMA that she was a leader .PERIOD
And I said to my translator ,COMMA What's going on ,COMMA why is she crying ?QUESTIONMARK
And I said ,COMMA I'm 28 years old ,COMMA and I live in hotels ,COMMA and I'm not married .PERIOD
And they had no idea about this request that she'd made of me .PERIOD
So I finally found Myung Sung ,COMMA her best friend that she used to play with after school every day .PERIOD
And I said to the translator ,COMMA What did he say ?QUESTIONMARK
And I said ,COMMA Well ,COMMA tell him that I am a photographer .PERIOD
I sort of had this picture of this incredibly wonderful ,COMMA bright ,COMMA happy little child ,COMMA who now appeared to be very withdrawn ,COMMA being enslaved by this family .PERIOD
So I finally decided ,COMMA I said Look ,COMMA -- this is all through the translator ,COMMA because ,COMMA this is all ,COMMA you know ,COMMA I don't speak a word of Korean -- and I said ,COMMA Look ,COMMA I'm really glad that Hyun-Sook has a family to live with .PERIOD
I don't pretend to understand what's going on here .PERIOD
Well ,COMMA there was an American Marine priest that I had met in the course of doing the story ,COMMA who had 75 children living in his house .PERIOD
He had kids from all over Korea living there ,COMMA and he would find families for these kids .PERIOD
Hyun-Sook stayed at Father Keene's ,COMMA and her uncle agreed to let her stay there until the adoption went through .PERIOD
And then she set up a work detail list of who cleaned the orphanage on what day .PERIOD
We went back to our hotel room ,COMMA and Gene was showing Natasha also where Atlanta was .PERIOD
And we fall asleep -- and I've been in this room ,COMMA you know ,COMMA for a couple of months now .PERIOD
And they always overheat the hotels in Korea terribly ,COMMA so during the day I always left the window open .PERIOD
And I don't speak Korean ,COMMA but I'm hearing these voices ,COMMA and I'm not hearing anger ,COMMA I'm hearing terror .PERIOD
I remember his son had the LL .PERIOD Bean bootlaces ,COMMA and we're trying to do up his laces .PERIOD
So ,COMMA we ran to the bathroom ,COMMA and got towels ,COMMA and put them over our faces ,COMMA and the kids faces .PERIOD
Eleven people ended up dying in the fire .PERIOD
Five people jumped and died ,COMMA other people were killed by the smoke .PERIOD
So it turned into a dual celebration ,COMMA because Natasha was the first person from this village ever to go to the United States .PERIOD
This is saying goodbye to everybody at the orphanage .PERIOD
And the pilot ,COMMA Jeff Cowley ,COMMA actually went back and adopted one of the other kids at the orphanage after meeting Natasha .PERIOD
So ,COMMA at this point ,COMMA Natasha doesn't speak a word of English ,COMMA other than what little Father Keene taught her .PERIOD
She learned English in three months .PERIOD
Natasha told me that a lot of the kids thought she was stuck up ,COMMA because they would talk to her and she wouldn't answer ,COMMA and they didn't realize she didn't actually speak English very well ,COMMA in the beginning .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA remember the picture ,COMMA how much she looked like her grandmother ,COMMA at the beginning ?QUESTIONMARK
The captain of the cheerleaders .PERIOD
This is her half-sister .PERIOD
Natasha ,COMMA would you just come up ,COMMA for a second ,COMMA just maybe to say hello to everybody ?QUESTIONMARK
Natasha :COLON I've seen pictures millions of times ,COMMA but today was the first time I'm actually seeing him give the whole presentation .PERIOD
I started crying .PERIOD
The telescope is actually built similarly to the ,COMMA well-known to you ,COMMA Hubble Space Telescope ,COMMA except it does have an additional lens -- a wide-field lens ,COMMA as you would call it as a photographer .PERIOD
The way we do that ,COMMA actually ,COMMA is with a method ,COMMA which we call the transit method .PERIOD
But we learn a lot from that :COLON not only that there is a planet there ,COMMA but we also learn its size .PERIOD
So ,COMMA what have we learned ?QUESTIONMARK
And we do care about planets like the Earth because by now we understood that life as a chemical system really needs a smaller planet with water and with rocks and with a lot of complex chemistry to originate ,COMMA to emerge ,COMMA to survive .PERIOD
So today ,COMMA I'm here to actually give you a first glimpse of what the new telescope ,COMMA Kepler ,COMMA has been able to tell us in the last few weeks ,COMMA and ,COMMA lo and behold ,COMMA we are back to the harmony and to fulfilling the dreams of Copernicus .PERIOD
It's about 100 million such planets .PERIOD
So that's great because then we can go and study them -- remotely ,COMMA of course -- with all the techniques that we already have tested in the past five years .PERIOD
The one that this step is enabling us to do is coming next .PERIOD
So the question is :COLON is that chemical phenomenon universal ,COMMA or is it something which depends on the planet ?QUESTIONMARK
We don't want to go blind because there's too many possibilities ,COMMA and there is not too much lab ,COMMA and there is not enough human time to actually to do all the experiments .PERIOD
Well ,COMMA there are many reasons ,COMMA and you heard some of them in the short talk today .PERIOD
And that is going to change our worldview in a profound way -- not in a dissimilar way as 400 years ago ,COMMA Copernicus' act did ,COMMA by changing the way we view space and time .PERIOD
And half the time ,COMMA what's happened is it's related this kind of sense of insignificance to humankind ,COMMA to the Earth in a bigger space .PERIOD
I mean look ,COMMA you can see the necktie ,COMMA but you can't even imagine seeing the size of a little ,COMMA small atom .PERIOD
So what does this tell us ?QUESTIONMARK
There is immense ,COMMA powerful potential in life in this universe -- especially now that we know that places like the Earth are common .PERIOD
Let's start this new revolution at the tail end of the old one ,COMMA with synthetic biology being the way to transform both our environment and our future .PERIOD
These Gapminder bubbles show you how the spread of the virus was in 1983 in the world ,COMMA or how we estimate that it was .PERIOD
Look ,COMMA India got many infected ,COMMA but had a low level .PERIOD
And almost the same happens here .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA let me make a fast replay of Botswana .PERIOD
And if people who are infected are treated ,COMMA they don't die of AIDS .PERIOD
In spite of PEPFAR ,COMMA the generous PEPFAR ,COMMA all people are not reached by treatment ,COMMA and of those who are reached by treatment in the poor countries ,COMMA only 60 percent are left on treatment after two years .PERIOD
No ,COMMA it's not .PERIOD Look here .PERIOD
There's a lot of things that we thought ,COMMA that now ,COMMA good research ,COMMA done by African institutions and researchers together with the international researchers ,COMMA show that that's not the case .PERIOD
See the difference within one African country -- it goes from very low level to very high level ,COMMA and most of the provinces in Kenya is quite modest .PERIOD
So ,COMMA what is it then ?QUESTIONMARK
It could be concurrency .PERIOD
And we have a terrible chlamydia epidemic -- terrible chlamydia epidemic which sticks around for many years .PERIOD
Let's talk about past and future billions .PERIOD
We know that most of that wealth was made after the year 1800 .PERIOD
And notice ,COMMA most of that went to the motherland ,COMMA to the imperial metropoles ,COMMA not to their colonial possessions .PERIOD
So I'm going to translate this into language that you can understand .PERIOD
Let me very briefly tell you what I mean by this ,COMMA synthesizing the work of many economic historians in the process .PERIOD
That really was a killer application .PERIOD
Property rights :COLON It's not the democracy ,COMMA folks ;SEMICOLON it's having the rule of law based on private property rights .PERIOD
Very few Indians today wish that India had gone down Mahatma Gandhi's road .PERIOD
Finally ,COMMA the work ethic .PERIOD
He was wrong .PERIOD
Take a look at mathematical attainment by 15 year-olds .PERIOD
Now it's just five times ,COMMA and soon it will be 25 times .PERIOD
And could Africa get that sequencing wrong ?QUESTIONMARK
One obvious implication of modern economic history is that it's quite hard to transition to democracy before you've established secure private property rights .PERIOD
Warning :COLON that may not work .PERIOD
That's the basis for the Western model of representative government .PERIOD
And I think these words really nail it :COLON It means a society based upon the opinion of civilians .PERIOD
That's not the way history works .PERIOD
That's one of the most profound insights to come out of the historical study of complex institutions like civilizations .PERIOD
What's your view on that ?QUESTIONMARK
Niall Ferguson :COLON Well I really am not just talking about the rise of the East ;SEMICOLON I'm talking about the rise of the Rest ,COMMA and that includes South America .PERIOD
I once asked one of my colleagues at Harvard ,COMMA Hey ,COMMA is South America part of the West ?QUESTIONMARK
Spiders are not just everywhere ,COMMA but they're extremely diverse .PERIOD
Spiders are also extremely old .PERIOD
Even fossil spiders can make silk ,COMMA as we can see from this impression of a spinneret on this fossil spider .PERIOD
So this means that both spiders and spider silk have been around for 380 million years .PERIOD
You can see multiple fibers coming out of the spinnerets ,COMMA because each spinneret has many spigots on it .PERIOD
In an orb-web-weaving spider ,COMMA you can find seven types of silk glands ,COMMA and what I have depicted here in this picture ,COMMA let's start at the one o'clock position ,COMMA there's tubuliform silk glands ,COMMA which are used to make the outer silk of an egg sac .PERIOD
So silk fibers vary in their strength and also their extensibility .PERIOD
If it wasn't able to stretch so much ,COMMA then basically when an insect hit the web ,COMMA it would just trampoline right off of it .PERIOD
Some of them are orb-weaving spiders and some of them are non-orb-weaving spiders .PERIOD
How do groups get anything done ?QUESTIONMARK Right ?QUESTIONMARK
How do you organize a group of individuals so that the output of the group is something coherent and of lasting value ,COMMA instead of just being chaos ?QUESTIONMARK
And a coordination cost is essentially all of the financial or institutional difficulties in arranging group output .PERIOD
More recently ,COMMA because the cost of letting groups communicate with each other has fallen through the floor -- and communication costs are one of the big inputs to coordination -- there has been a second answer ,COMMA which is to put the cooperation into the infrastructure ,COMMA to design systems that coordinate the output of the group as a by-product of the operating of the system ,COMMA without regard to institutional models .PERIOD
And what I want to call your attention to is not the Mermaid Parade itself ,COMMA charming though it is ,COMMA but rather to these photos .PERIOD
First of all ,COMMA when you form an institution ,COMMA you take on a management problem ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK
You have to have legal structure .PERIOD
Third ,COMMA forming an institution is inherently exclusionary .PERIOD
You can't hire everyone in a company ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK
When you build cooperation into the infrastructure ,COMMA which is the Flickr answer ,COMMA you can leave the people where they are and you take the problem to the individuals ,COMMA rather than moving the individuals to the problem .PERIOD
In bigger systems ,COMMA the head gets bigger and the tail gets longer ,COMMA so the imbalance increases .PERIOD
If you go down to five percent ,COMMA you're still accounting for 60 percent of the photos .PERIOD
We've looked at who's contributed to Linux ,COMMA and most of the patches have been produced by programmers who've only done one thing .PERIOD Right ?QUESTIONMARK
Do you want that patch ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK
Meetup ,COMMA a service founded so that users could find people in their local area who share their interests and affinities and actually have a real-world meeting offline in a cafe or a pub or what have you .PERIOD
Stay-at-home moms .PERIOD Right ?QUESTIONMARK
It is a one-button operation that you can do for free .PERIOD
And the answer to that question is ,COMMA it doesn't matter ,COMMA because that's not the right question .PERIOD
And if there is an answer to that that happens outside the professional framework of journalism ,COMMA it makes no sense to take a professional metaphor and apply it to this distributed class .PERIOD
They trade tips ,COMMA like ,COMMA if you feel like eating something ,COMMA clean a toilet or the litter box .PERIOD The feeling will pass .PERIOD
We have an attitude that support groups are inherently beneficial .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA when the larger group is a bunch of drunks ,COMMA and the small group wants to stay sober ,COMMA then we think ,COMMA that's a great support group .PERIOD
But when the small group is teenage girls who want to stay anorexic by choice ,COMMA then we're horrified .PERIOD
Flavor is king .PERIOD Flavor rules .PERIOD
So ,COMMA this is the challenge for this bread .PERIOD
And this is what every student has to begin with .PERIOD
Everyone who works in the culinary world knows that the first stage of cooking is mise en place ,COMMA which is just a French way of saying ,COMMA get organized .PERIOD
Everything in its place .PERIOD First stage .PERIOD
Stage two is mixing .PERIOD We take the ingredients and we mix them .PERIOD
And so we ,COMMA in the mixing process ,COMMA have to develop the gluten ,COMMA we have to activate the leaven or the yeast ,COMMA and we have to essentially distribute all the ingredients evenly .PERIOD
And at stage nine we get the dough to the final shape ,COMMA and it goes into the oven -- stage 10 .PERIOD
And the starches ,COMMA when they reach about 180 degrees ,COMMA gelatinize .PERIOD
And stage 11 ,COMMA we call it cooling -- because we never really eat the bread right away .PERIOD
And we save some of those for the next generation .PERIOD
So we turn it into flour .PERIOD
Not like hot water made cold ,COMMA or cold water turned hot ,COMMA but water boiled off and becoming steam .PERIOD
So ,COMMA we've got now this flour .PERIOD
And what do we do ?QUESTIONMARK We add some water .PERIOD
Or another analogy would be ,COMMA a caterpillar has been turned into a butterfly .PERIOD
But we've got this bread ,COMMA and what I did here is to try to ,COMMA again ,COMMA evoke even more flavor from this grain ,COMMA was we've added into it the spent grain from beer-making .PERIOD
And so this is ,COMMA again ,COMMA hopefully not only a healthy bread ,COMMA but a bread that you will enjoy .PERIOD
So ,COMMA if I ,COMMA kind of ,COMMA break this bread ,COMMA maybe we can share this now a little bit here .PERIOD
We'll start a little piece here ,COMMA and I'm going to take a little piece here -- I think I'd better taste it myself before you have it at lunch .PERIOD
Let me give you just one example of this .PERIOD
Now the question is :COLON How could we ask them ?QUESTIONMARK
But half the time ,COMMA what she would do is take a little bit of the broccoli and go ,COMMA Mmmmm ,COMMA broccoli .PERIOD
So she'd act as if what she wanted was just the opposite of what the babies wanted .PERIOD
The question you might ask though is :COLON Why do children learn so much ?QUESTIONMARK
Well what kind of explanation could we have for this ?QUESTIONMARK
And essentially what Bayes did was to provide a mathematical way using probability theory to characterize ,COMMA describe ,COMMA the way that scientists find out about the world .PERIOD
And some 10 years ago ,COMMA I suggested that babies might be doing the same thing .PERIOD
Because if you wave a block over the top of the detector ,COMMA something you wouldn't ever think of to begin with ,COMMA the detector will actually activate two out of three times .PERIOD
Now there are two things that are really interesting about this .PERIOD
The first one is ,COMMA again ,COMMA remember ,COMMA these are four year-olds .PERIOD
They're just learning how to count .PERIOD
And there's been a bunch of interesting studies recently that have shown this playing around is really a kind of experimental research program .PERIOD
I don't know .PERIOD
Not working either .PERIOD
I think babies and children are actually more conscious than we are as adults .PERIOD
It's good to be a grownup .PERIOD
That technology is simulating humans .PERIOD
And what you can see is -- it is actually a very good game .PERIOD
I've made him run into a wall here ,COMMA over and over again .PERIOD
So ,COMMA we simulated that as well ,COMMA and then the really tricky bit is to teach that network how to walk .PERIOD
We heard about those already yesterday ,COMMA and I suppose that most of you are familiar with that already .PERIOD
Those are then selected by the algorithm ,COMMA reproduced with mutation and recombinations to introduce sex as well .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA this might look kind of trivial ,COMMA but it's actually very important because this is not something you get at the moment in any interactive or any virtual worlds .PERIOD
So that's what you see here .PERIOD
We just took this character that I just talked about ,COMMA put it on a slippery surface ,COMMA and this is what you get out of it .PERIOD
So that you don't have a character that looks limp ,COMMA but actually a character that you can use in an action film straight away ,COMMA that looks kind of alive in midair as well .PERIOD
That's one angle ;SEMICOLON here's another angle .PERIOD
So this is exactly the same behavior that you saw ,COMMA but in a slightly better rendered version .PERIOD
This is incredibly quick .PERIOD This is happening in real time .PERIOD
This is another behavior they requested .PERIOD
You feel kind of sorry for the guy .PERIOD
It's even worse -- and that is another video I just got last night -- if you render that a bit more realistically .PERIOD
Yes ,COMMA you can just about see it here .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA we've just tried and -- looked at our character and asked ourselves ,COMMA Can we do that ourselves as well ?QUESTIONMARK
This was an AI contour that was produced and evolved -- half-evolved ,COMMA I should say -- to produce balance ,COMMA basically .PERIOD
So ,COMMA that all happened automatically .PERIOD We didn't put that in there .PERIOD
Thanks .PERIOD
You can draw ,COMMA as everyone should .PERIOD
Shake it ,COMMA and you have a heterosexual couple .PERIOD
You know ,COMMA I'm making a very important argument .PERIOD
I'm making an argument that art and creativity are very essential tools in empathy .PERIOD
Say your motorcycle crashes .PERIOD
OK .PERIOD When I was offered the Times column six years ago ,COMMA the deal was like this :COLON you'll be sent the coolest ,COMMA hottest ,COMMA slickest new gadgets .PERIOD
Every week it'll arrive at your door .PERIOD
The job ,COMMA though ,COMMA came with one small downside .PERIOD And that is :COLON they intended to publish my email address at the end of every column .PERIOD
The guy had a duplicate headset for me to listen to .PERIOD
Some of the stories are just so classic ,COMMA and yet so understandable .PERIOD
And the technician's like ,COMMA Ma'am ,COMMA you've got the mouse up against the screen ?QUESTIONMARK
And we've arrived at the age of interface matrices ,COMMA where there are so many features and options ,COMMA you have to do two dimensions ,COMMA you know :COLON a vertical and a horizontal .PERIOD You guys all complained about how Microsoft Word is always bulleting your lists and underlining your links automatically .PERIOD
It's not like the rest of the screen is so full of other components that you need to collapse the choices .PERIOD
So there is a limit that we don't want to cross .PERIOD So what is the answer ?QUESTIONMARK
I'm sorry ;SEMICOLON it's not one yet .PERIOD
You have to scroll ,COMMA like ,COMMA seven screens-full to get to it .PERIOD
It's like a 747 shuttle cockpit .PERIOD
You do not .PERIOD
We've entered planet domination mode .PERIOD
They're dying to throw the whole thing out and start fresh ,COMMA but they can't .PERIOD They're locked in because so many add-ons and other company stuff locks into the old 1982 chassis .PERIOD
I liked the Media Center PC .PERIOD I liked the Microsoft SPOT Watch .PERIOD
The lesson was :COLON simplicity sells .PERIOD
Here's another example .PERIOD Chris ,COMMA you're the source of all power .PERIOD
In my very last example -- I do a lot of my work using speech recognition software ,COMMA and you have to be kind of quiet because the software is nervous .PERIOD
I also use this feature called voice macros .PERIOD Period .PERIOD
Correct dissuade .PERIOD Not just .PERIOD
No new features .PERIOD It's never happened before in software !EXCLAMATIONMARK
It could be the design of the thing you're using .PERIOD
But I also ,COMMA in looking at more powerful technologies and nanotechnology and genetic engineering and other new emerging kind of digital technologies ,COMMA became very concerned about the potential for abuse .PERIOD
And we can't fight the threat in the kind of stupid way we're doing ,COMMA because a million-dollar act causes a billion dollars of damage ,COMMA causes a trillion dollar response which is largely ineffective and arguably ,COMMA probably almost certainly ,COMMA has made the problem worse .PERIOD
So after giving up on the book -- and I had the great honor to be able to join Kleiner Perkins about a year ago ,COMMA and to work through venture capital on the innovative side ,COMMA and to try to find some innovations that could address what I saw as some of these big problems .PERIOD
Things where ,COMMA you know ,COMMA a factor of 10 difference can make a factor of 1000 difference in the outcome .PERIOD
The first is this whole area of education ,COMMA and it really relates to what Nicholas was talking about with a $ 100 computer .PERIOD
I think the challenge for us is -- I'm very certain that that will happen ,COMMA the challenge is ,COMMA will we develop the kind of educational tools and things with the net to let us take advantage of that device ?QUESTIONMARK
I'd argue today that we have incredibly powerful computers ,COMMA but we don't have very good software for them .PERIOD
So given that we know and should believe -- because Moore's Law's been ,COMMA like ,COMMA a constant ,COMMA I mean ,COMMA it's just been very predictable progress over the last 40 years or whatever .PERIOD
We have a challenge ,COMMA because the urban population is growing in this century from two billion to six billion in a very short amount of time .PERIOD People are moving to the cities .PERIOD
And these are the kinds of things we're going to discover as we start to engineer at the nano scale .PERIOD
We believe that Genentech ,COMMA the Compaq ,COMMA the Lotus ,COMMA the Sun ,COMMA the Netscape ,COMMA the Amazon ,COMMA the Google in these fields are yet to be found ,COMMA because this materials revolution will drive these things forward .PERIOD
And to give you an idea of the last fund that Kleiner raised was a $ 400 million fund ,COMMA so this for us is a very substantial fund .PERIOD
And what we did ,COMMA over the last few months -- well ,COMMA a few months ago ,COMMA Ray Kurzweil and I wrote an op-ed in the New York Times about how publishing the 1918 genome was very dangerous .PERIOD
You normally get a trivalent vaccine against three possible strains .PERIOD
We believe that if we could fill these 10 gaps ,COMMA we have a chance to help really reduce the risk of a pandemic .PERIOD
So we're very excited because we think we can fund 10 ,COMMA or speed up 10 projects and see them come to market in the next couple years that will address this .PERIOD
But above all ,COMMA what we have to do is we have to help the good guys ,COMMA the people on the defensive side ,COMMA have an advantage over the people who want to abuse things .PERIOD
Many of them are trying to kill us from the minute we go into them ,COMMA but nevertheless ,COMMA they're absolutely gripping ,COMMA and contain unbelievable biological wonders that are very ,COMMA very different from those that we have on the planet .PERIOD
Apart from the intrinsic value of the biology and mineralogy and geo-microbiology that we do there ,COMMA we're also using these as templates for figuring out how to go look for life on other planets .PERIOD
Particularly Mars ,COMMA but also Europa ,COMMA the small ,COMMA icy moon around Jupiter .PERIOD
We're getting ready to begin to go through the process of leaving our planet of origin and out into the wider solar system and beyond .PERIOD
I think ,COMMA myself ,COMMA that life is a natural outgrowth of the increasing complexification of matter over time .PERIOD
It's going to be everywhere we look -- where there are planetary systems that can possibly support it .PERIOD
So this is a very bold statement .PERIOD
How do you know it when you find it ?QUESTIONMARK
Very critically ,COMMA how do we protect it ,COMMA if we find it ,COMMA and not contaminate it ?QUESTIONMARK
If I were to take a swab off your teeth and plate it on a Petri plate ,COMMA within about four or five hours ,COMMA I would have to see growth .PERIOD
So they are ,COMMA intrinsically ,COMMA a slower life-form .PERIOD
It's a very simple trick ,COMMA and I never fail to do it when I'm sitting in a window seat .PERIOD
This is regularly several hundred parts per million .PERIOD
And these are mineral deposits that are also made by bacteria .PERIOD
And so ,COMMA one can send a thousand of them ,COMMA as you can see in this upper left-hand picture ,COMMA a thousand of them could fit into the payload bay that was used for one of the current MER Rovers .PERIOD
The question as to whether there is life on Mars that is related to life on Earth has now been very muddied ,COMMA because we now know ,COMMA from Mars meteorites that have made it to Earth ,COMMA that there's material that can be exchanged between those two planets .PERIOD
One of the burning questions ,COMMA of course ,COMMA is if we go there and find life in the sub-surface ,COMMA as I fully expect that we will ,COMMA is that a second genesis of life ?QUESTIONMARK
Did it start there and get transported here ?QUESTIONMARK
This will be a fascinating puzzle as we go into the next half-century ,COMMA and where I expect that we will have more and more Mars missions to answer these questions .PERIOD
For real -- you can take a second .PERIOD You've got to feel this to learn it .PERIOD
Well ,COMMA you could resist the temptation to announce your goal .PERIOD
He wouldn't reveal the exact number of bottles ,COMMA he would not reveal exactly where the building was and he would not reveal exactly who owned the building .PERIOD
And he ended up spending over a million dollars and hiring ex-FBI and ex-Scotland Yard agents to try to get to the bottom of this .PERIOD
There are very few places in the US .PERIOD where you can try real Kobe ,COMMA and one of them is Wolfgang Puck's restaurant ,COMMA Cut ,COMMA in Los Angeles .PERIOD
It was like ,COMMA 160 dollars for this ?QUESTIONMARK
And then I was left with these little ugly flakes on my pasta that ,COMMA you know ,COMMA their purpose had been served ,COMMA and so I'm afraid to say that this was also a disappointment to me .PERIOD
This is soap that's made from silver nanoparticles ,COMMA which have antibacterial properties .PERIOD
And it ,COMMA you know ,COMMA tickled a little bit and it smelled good ,COMMA but I have to say that nobody here has complimented me on the cleanliness of my face today .PERIOD
These ones GQ did spring for -- I own these -- but I will tell you ,COMMA not only did I not get a compliment from any of you ,COMMA I have not gotten a compliment from anybody in the months that I have owned and worn these .PERIOD
And then an enzyme in its digestive tract leeches into the beans ,COMMA and people with the unenviable job of collecting these cats' leavings then go through the forest collecting the ,COMMA you know ,COMMA results and processing it into coffee -- although you actually can buy it in the unprocessed form .PERIOD
But anyway ,COMMA we had a great night's sleep .PERIOD
And you spend a third of your life in bed .PERIOD
This is Tom Cruise arriving at the Mission :COLON Impossible III premiere .PERIOD
When he tries to open the door ,COMMA you could call it Mission :COLON Impossible IV .PERIOD
There was one object that I could not get my hands on ,COMMA and that was the 1947 Cheval Blanc .PERIOD
And it was an invitation you do not refuse .PERIOD
Earlier this year ,COMMA a virtual asteroid in it sold for 330000 real dollars .PERIOD
And this is a Titan class ship in the space game ,COMMA EVE Online .PERIOD
It gives you great powers .PERIOD
Your ambition is satisfied ,COMMA but it's very beautiful .PERIOD
And so these combine to form a very intense emotional engagement .PERIOD
But this isn't the really interesting stuff .PERIOD
The really interesting stuff about virtuality is what you can measure with it .PERIOD
The game's just trying to get people to open about a million boxes ,COMMA getting better and better stuff in them .PERIOD
This sounds immensely boring but games are able to make this process incredibly compelling .PERIOD
But we don't just have pies in the boxes .PERIOD
And also ,COMMA we say ,COMMA Well ,COMMA how many monsters ?QUESTIONMARK Should I have the entire world full of a billion monsters ?QUESTIONMARK
They're not rational about probability .PERIOD
It's not giving me my last two pies .PERIOD I'm going to give up .PERIOD
And the point is really that we evolved to be satisfied by the world in particular ways .PERIOD
So ,COMMA you give people lots and lots of different tasks .PERIOD
Third ,COMMA you reward effort .PERIOD
And something very exciting is just beginning to happen in places like the University of Bristol in the UK ,COMMA where we are beginning to be able to model mathematically dopamine levels in the brain .PERIOD
And the success rate is at close to 100 percent .PERIOD
Let's start with business .PERIOD
But each bag we'd sell would provide a year's worth of school meals for one kid .PERIOD
All this time you're -- when you think about hunger ,COMMA it's a hard thing to think about ,COMMA because what we think about is eating .PERIOD
There's definitely hunger in America :COLON 49 million people and almost 167 million children .PERIOD
Hunger definitely means something a little bit different in America than it does internationally ,COMMA but it's incredibly important to address hunger in our own country .PERIOD
Well ,COMMA they're both about food .PERIOD
And you know ,COMMA the reality is that between farmers in America ,COMMA who actually ,COMMA quite frankly ,COMMA when I spend time in the Midwest ,COMMA are pretty large in general .PERIOD
So the problematic food system is affecting both hunger and obesity .PERIOD
Not to beat a dead horse ,COMMA but this is a global food system where there's a billion people hungry and billion people obese .PERIOD
And how are we going to get those kids those nutritious foods ?QUESTIONMARK
Another thing that's become incredibly global is production of meat and fish .PERIOD
And we were going to do something that was horrible for the profession .PERIOD
And that the incredible amount of effort to deliver those sketches for years and years and years is not only something to be derided ,COMMA but we would merely write it off as merely execution .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA there are all kinds of things that we architects need to learn how to do ,COMMA like managing contracts ,COMMA learning how to write contracts ,COMMA understanding procurement processes ,COMMA understanding the time value of money and cost estimation .PERIOD
Take joint positions with your client .PERIOD
Why was this horrible little building so important to their renown and their innovation ?QUESTIONMARK
Because they could do whatever they wanted to to this building .PERIOD
The architectural manifestation was frankly just dumb .PERIOD
In fact it really was the clients who had to do it .PERIOD
They had to make a decision ,COMMA based on the positions we took to redefine the budget being from two thirds capital-A architecture and one-third infrastructure ,COMMA to actually the inverse ,COMMA two-thirds infrastructure and one-third capital-A architecture .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA that theater machine has ability to move between a whole series of configurations at the push of a button and a few stagehands in a short amount of time .PERIOD
But it also has the potential to not only provide multiform but multi-processional sequences .PERIOD
And some of the seats need to actually change their direction ,COMMA and change their rake ,COMMA to allow that to happen .PERIOD
There you see it's the side balconies for the proscenium .PERIOD
Meaning ,COMMA nothing that we do can we be the first ones to do it .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA if I'll take you through -- this is an early concept sketch -- take you through kind of a mixture of all these things together .PERIOD
You would be allowed to bring objects or performers into the performing chamber :COLON Aida ,COMMA their elephants ,COMMA you can bring the elephants in .PERIOD
Et voila .PERIOD
This is the AT&ampT Performing Arts Center's Dee and Charles Wyly Theater .PERIOD
But we got to that conclusion without understanding where we were going ,COMMA what we knew were a series of issues that the company and the client was confronted with .PERIOD
So this is a picture of me holding one of the first watercolor paintings I ever made .PERIOD
I have many of these books ,COMMA and I've been keeping them for about the last eight or nine years .PERIOD
And I really loved this idea of the partial glimpse into somebody's life .PERIOD
As opposed to knowing the whole story ,COMMA just knowing a little bit of the story ,COMMA and then letting your own mind fill in the rest .PERIOD
This is a project that scans the world's newly posted blog entries every two or three minutes ,COMMA searching for occurrences of the phrases I feel and I am feeling .PERIOD And when it finds one of those phrases ,COMMA it grabs the full sentence up to the period and also tries to identify demographic information about the author .PERIOD
And when that happens ,COMMA these montage compositions are automatically created ,COMMA which consist of the sentence and images being combined .PERIOD
I'm 23 ,COMMA and a recovering meth and heroin addict ,COMMA and feel absolutely blessed to still be alive .PERIOD
I feel sassy .PERIOD
As you can see ,COMMA We Feel Fine collects very ,COMMA very small-scale personal stories .PERIOD
So ,COMMA really even challenging the notion of what can be considered a story .PERIOD
And the Eskimo community basically camps out on the edge of the ice here ,COMMA waits for a whale to come close enough to attack .PERIOD And when it does ,COMMA it throws a harpoon at it ,COMMA and then hauls the whale up under the ice ,COMMA and cuts it up .PERIOD
They have colors .PERIOD What do they look like ?QUESTIONMARK
This is in the Patkotak's family living room in their house in Barrow .PERIOD The boxed wine they served us .PERIOD
Cigarette break outside -- I don't smoke .PERIOD
So ,COMMA you have some really happy person holding 10 balloons ,COMMA and some really sad soul holding one balloon .PERIOD
A 16 -year-old student .PERIOD
I asked her about that ,COMMA and she said she meant that she doesn't want to be married ,COMMA because ,COMMA in her opinion ,COMMA when you get married in Bhutan as a woman ,COMMA your chances to live an independent life kind of end ,COMMA and so she had no interest in that .PERIOD
A 37 -year-old road worker .PERIOD
His wish was to make some money and open a store .PERIOD
Finally ,COMMA this is a 26 -year-old nun I spoke to .PERIOD
I asked her a little bit more about the cave and what she planned would happen once she went there ,COMMA you know .PERIOD
Jonathan Harris :COLON Maybe you'll die ?QUESTIONMARK Woman :COLON Yes .PERIOD
Yeah ,COMMA but -- yeah ,COMMA OK .PERIOD Do you hope -- would you prefer to live in the cave for 40 years ,COMMA or to live for one year ?QUESTIONMARK
Woman :COLON Yes .PERIOD From then ,COMMA I'm going to the heaven .PERIOD
You can start to see some familiar balloons here .PERIOD
Thank you .PERIOD
So ,COMMA the approach that we took was the other way around .PERIOD
What you see here is a prototypic device .PERIOD
It's made of paper and paper ,COMMA of course ,COMMA wicks fluid ,COMMA as you know ,COMMA paper ,COMMA cloth -- drop wine on the tablecloth ,COMMA and the wine wicks all over everything .PERIOD
So ,COMMA the production capability is there .PERIOD
And the procedure that we have is simply to start with paper .PERIOD
You can't manipulate it very well ,COMMA although I'll show something about that in a moment .PERIOD
So ,COMMA you take the drop of blood ,COMMA no further manipulations ,COMMA you put it on a little device ,COMMA the device filters out the blood cells ,COMMA lets the serum go through ,COMMA and you get a series of colors down in the bottom there .PERIOD
Turns out to work actually quite well ,COMMA particularly when your color printer has printed the color bars that indicate how things work .PERIOD
I don't know whether the idea of one computer ,COMMA one child makes any sense .PERIOD Here's the computer of the future ,COMMA because this screen is already there and they're ubiquitous .PERIOD
The answer is that what you do ,COMMA and the details are not terribly important here ,COMMA is to make something more elaborate :COLON You take several different layers of paper ,COMMA each one containing its own little fluid system ,COMMA and you separate them by pieces of ,COMMA literally ,COMMA double-sided carpet tape ,COMMA the stuff you use to stick the carpets onto the floor .PERIOD
But that is ,COMMA in principle ,COMMA the way you solve the fever of unexplained origin problem ,COMMA because each one of those spots then becomes a test for a particular set of markers of disease ,COMMA and this will work in due course .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA I have one last ,COMMA two last little stories to tell you ,COMMA in finishing off this business .PERIOD
We were very proud of this ,COMMA particularly the title ,COMMA which was Eggbeater as Centrifuge .PERIOD
We all struggled for an entire day to think about simplicity .PERIOD
Why are we spending $ 135 billion ?QUESTIONMARK
In the fourth act ,COMMA with our hubris ,COMMA our overconfidence developing ,COMMA we invaded Iraq and Afghanistan ,COMMA and in the fifth act ,COMMA we plunged into a humiliating mess .PERIOD
When I walked across Afghanistan in the winter of 2001 - 2002 ,COMMA what I saw was scenes like this .PERIOD
In Sangin where I was sick in 2002 ,COMMA the nearest health clinic was within three days walk .PERIOD
And the same is true for the troops .PERIOD
And the reason I'm looking a little bit perplexed in this photograph is I was somewhat frightened ,COMMA and I was too afraid on this occasion to ask him ,COMMA having run for an hour through the desert and taken refuge in this house ,COMMA why he had turned up and wanted to have his photograph taken with me .PERIOD
Now this is not to say Afghanistan is a place full of people like Mullah Mustafa .PERIOD
I ran a center at Harvard from 2008 to 2010 ,COMMA and there were people like Michael Semple there who speak Afghan languages fluently ,COMMA who've traveled to almost every district in the country .PERIOD
You feel deep ,COMMA deep guilt .PERIOD
The average British soldier is on a tour of only six months ;SEMICOLON Italian soldiers ,COMMA on tours of four months ;SEMICOLON the American military ,COMMA on tours of 12 months .PERIOD
So we need to change that institutional culture .PERIOD
Secondly ,COMMA we need to aim off of the optimism of the generals .PERIOD
Borders between the Bosniak territory and the Bosnian-Serb territory have calmed down .PERIOD
If what we're interested in is regional stability ,COMMA Egypt is far more important .PERIOD
Just briefly ,COMMA what's your take on the current events there and the intervention ?QUESTIONMARK

Because focusing on that part of it -- not the mechanics of what you're building ,COMMA but the who ,COMMA and the leading part -- is where change comes .PERIOD
So here is what leaders have in common .PERIOD The first thing is ,COMMA they challenge the status quo .PERIOD

So that doesn't really work .PERIOD
And it turns out that a sound like this is the most energy efficient and practical way to transmit their call across the fields and savannahs .PERIOD
It's adaptive .PERIOD
And I'm saying ,COMMA well ,COMMA the passion's still there ,COMMA but the vessel that it's going to be injected into and poured into ,COMMA that is instinctively and intuitively created first .PERIOD

One out of four South Bronx children has asthma .PERIOD
Residents were often given less than a month's notice before their buildings were razed .PERIOD

Are these factors taken into consideration when land-use policy is decided ?QUESTIONMARK

Anyway -- OK .PERIOD Katrina .PERIOD Prior to Katrina ,COMMA the South Bronx and New Orleans' Ninth Ward had a lot in common .PERIOD Both were largely populated by poor people of color ,COMMA both hotbeds of cultural innovation :COLON think hip-hop and jazz .PERIOD
In the post-Katrina era ,COMMA we have still more in common .PERIOD
Neither the destruction of the Ninth Ward nor the South Bronx was inevitable .PERIOD
At present ,COMMA that's not happening in New York City .PERIOD
And although less than 25 percent of South Bronx residents own cars ,COMMA these projects include thousands of new parking spaces ,COMMA yet zip in terms of mass public transit .PERIOD
I do have a problem with developments that hyper-exploit politically vulnerable communities for profit .PERIOD
But one of the things I do to remind myself of greater possibilities is to learn from visionaries in other cities .PERIOD
He looked at the demographics .PERIOD
His administration narrowed key municipal thoroughfares from five lanes to three ,COMMA outlawed parking on those streets ,COMMA expanded pedestrian walkways and bike lanes ,COMMA created public plazas ,COMMA created one of the most efficient bus mass-transit systems in the entire world .PERIOD
I don't think he understood that I wasn't asking for funding .PERIOD
This is more or less what we saw last year ,COMMA and this is how it will go on into the future .PERIOD
Because you see now ,COMMA I presented statistics that don't exist .PERIOD

Environment is very ,COMMA very crucial .PERIOD
Of course ,COMMA it's human rights .PERIOD

Even African countries can achieve this .PERIOD
It's a cultural expression that for thousands of years has inspired human beings to think beyond the obvious .PERIOD

Automobiles are self-moving things ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK Elevators are automobiles .PERIOD
Cars are a sculpture -- did you know this ?QUESTIONMARK
OK ,COMMA it's not marketing ;SEMICOLON there's a very interesting car concept here ,COMMA but the marketing part is not what I want to talk about here .PERIOD
It's that will to live ,COMMA that need to survive ,COMMA to express itself ,COMMA that comes in a car ,COMMA and takes over people like me .PERIOD
And we tell other people ,COMMA Do this ,COMMA do this ,COMMA do this ,COMMA until this thing comes alive .PERIOD
We are completely infected .PERIOD And beauty can be the result of this infectiousness ;SEMICOLON it's quite wonderful .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA now I get to the point .PERIOD I want to talk about cars as art .PERIOD
We're not trying to find vanity and beauty .PERIOD
And that sometimes leads to bit of a divergence in why we're doing what we're doing .PERIOD
Toothbrush ,COMMA cool .PERIOD
I heard today about Joseph's death genes that have to go in and kill cell reproduction .PERIOD
This is very difficult ,COMMA and you have to have a bond with your team that permits you to do this ,COMMA because their life is wrapped up in that too .PERIOD
This is 1996 we did this project .PERIOD And so we sent them off with this team name ,COMMA Deep Blue .PERIOD Now many people know Deep Blue from IBM -- we actually stole it from them because we figured if anybody read our faxes they'd think we're talking about computers .PERIOD
And a group of engineers worked in Germany ,COMMA and the idea was they would work separately on this problem of what's the successor to the SUV .PERIOD
They would come together ,COMMA compare notes .PERIOD Then they would work apart ,COMMA come together ,COMMA and they would produce together a monumental set of diverse opinions that didn't pollute each other's ideas -- but at the same time came together and resolved the problems .PERIOD
The bathroom was so big ,COMMA she built the bed over the bathtub -- it's quite fascinating .PERIOD
Well ,COMMA what I didn't know was ,COMMA and what we found out was -- these guys ,COMMA they can't even like talk to each other under those conditions .PERIOD
There was a whole lot of dialog .PERIOD
We spent four hours being told all about vocabulary that needs to be built between engineers and designers .PERIOD
Dialog kept on going ,COMMA with mental maps of words ,COMMA and pretty soon it was becoming obvious that instead of being dazzled with brilliance ,COMMA I was seriously being baffled with bullshit .PERIOD
Because of course they didn't tell us that they had three station wagons full of drawings ,COMMA model concepts ,COMMA pictures -- everything I wanted ,COMMA they'd locked up in the cars ,COMMA because they had shown solidarity with the engineers -- and they'd decided not to show me anything ,COMMA in order to give the chance for problem solving a chance to start ,COMMA because they hadn't realized ,COMMA of course ,COMMA that they couldn't do problem creating .PERIOD
It's true that the trust and the love ,COMMA that makes it worthwhile .PERIOD
We didn't sequence his genome .PERIOD
And the reason is that cancer ,COMMA like every cell in the body ,COMMA places little molecular bookmarks ,COMMA little Post-it notes ,COMMA that remind the cell I'm cancer ;SEMICOLON I should keep growing .PERIOD
We just started mailing it to our friends .PERIOD
And as we treat it with our compound ,COMMA this addiction to sugar ,COMMA this rapid growth ,COMMA faded .PERIOD
And in fact ,COMMA this molecule prevents this adipocyte ,COMMA this fat stem cell ,COMMA from remembering how to make fat such that mice on a high fat diet ,COMMA like the folks in my hometown of Chicago ,COMMA fail to develop fatty liver ,COMMA which is a major medical problem .PERIOD
This molecule will soon leave our benches and go into a small startup company called Tensha Therapeutics .PERIOD
I've never seen really anywhere this unique support for cancer research .PERIOD
The age of the universe ,COMMA between now and the Big Bang ,COMMA is a hundred billion in dog years .PERIOD
If you looked at one of these galaxies and measured its velocity ,COMMA it would be moving away from you .PERIOD
And if you look at a galaxy even farther away ,COMMA it would be moving away faster .PERIOD
That kind of makes sense to us .PERIOD
The air in this room is very smooth .PERIOD
In particular ,COMMA things were a lot denser .PERIOD
What you have to think about is we have a universe with a hundred billion galaxies ,COMMA a hundred billion stars each .PERIOD
We'd like to understand that .PERIOD
One of the people who did understand that this was a problem was Richard Feynman .PERIOD
The arrow of time cannot be completely understood until the mystery of the beginnings of the history of the universe are reduced still further from speculation to understanding .PERIOD
It's not true that we've figured it out by now .PERIOD
The reason the problem has gotten worse ,COMMA rather than better ,COMMA is because in 1998 we learned something crucial about the universe that we didn't know before .PERIOD
And so even though the universe will last forever ,COMMA and ordinary matter and radiation will dilute away ,COMMA there will always be some radiation ,COMMA some thermal fluctuations ,COMMA even in empty space .PERIOD
It will probably increase ,COMMA and the probability is enormously huge .PERIOD
Remember ,COMMA life itself depends on the arrow of time .PERIOD
Occasionally ,COMMA you will make a planet or a star or a galaxy or a hundred billion galaxies .PERIOD
Now your homework assignment is to really think about this ,COMMA to contemplate what it means .PERIOD
I just showed you this picture .PERIOD
They all happen over a period of time equal to 10 to the 10 to the 120 years .PERIOD
So here's two questions for you .PERIOD
Maybe there is something that naturally ,COMMA through the growth of the laws of physics ,COMMA gives rise to universe like ours in low entropy configurations .PERIOD
My bold speculation is that I will be absolutely vindicated by history .PERIOD
And 50 years from now ,COMMA all of my current wild ideas will be accepted as truths by the scientific and external communities .PERIOD
This is a prediction .PERIOD I might be wrong .PERIOD
I would like to share that story today .PERIOD
Like everyone else ,COMMA we grew maize .PERIOD
I felt very happy to be at the secondary school ,COMMA so I was determined to do anything possible to receive education .PERIOD
So I went to a library .PERIOD
So I would like to say something to all the people out there like me to the Africans ,COMMA and the poor who are struggling with your dreams .PERIOD
God bless .PERIOD
Unlike most of our computing devices ,COMMA these objects are much more fun to use .PERIOD
A gesture of Namaste ,COMMA maybe ,COMMA to respect someone ,COMMA or maybe -- in India I don't need to teach a kid that this means four runs in cricket .PERIOD
So ,COMMA I was interested in these two rollers ,COMMA and I actually wanted more ,COMMA so I borrowed another mouse from a friend -- never returned to him -- and I now had four rollers .PERIOD
What I got is basically a gesture interface device that actually acts as a motion-sensing device made for two dollars .PERIOD
What we are interested in is information .PERIOD
So I thought ,COMMA around last year -- in the beginning of the last year -- I started thinking ,COMMA Why can I not take this approach in the reverse way ?QUESTIONMARK
But later ,COMMA I realized that I actually wanted to interact with those digital pixels ,COMMA also .PERIOD
You stop by a wall ,COMMA and start painting on that wall .PERIOD
So ,COMMA technically ,COMMA it's a little bit complex ,COMMA but it gives you an output which is more intuitive to use ,COMMA in some sense .PERIOD
Rather than getting your camera out of your pocket ,COMMA you can just do the gesture of taking a photo and it takes a photo for you .PERIOD
Once it has that information ,COMMA it finds out more reviews about that ,COMMA or maybe New York Times has a sound overview on that ,COMMA so you can actually hear ,COMMA on a physical book ,COMMA a review as sound .PERIOD
So ,COMMA I was seeing the live [video] of his talk ,COMMA outside ,COMMA on just a newspaper .PERIOD
So ,COMMA what I did here is remove the camera -- All the webcam cameras have a microphone inside the camera .PERIOD
and I am a Wilderness Explorer in Tribe 54 ) And you can of course play games .PERIOD
Yeah .PERIOD And I say ,COMMA OK ,COMMA this looks nice ,COMMA let me print it out ,COMMA that thing .PERIOD
Thank you .PERIOD
This is incredible ,COMMA really .PERIOD
And now ,COMMA if you see ,COMMA it's more about the cost-effectiveness :COLON this system costs you $ 300 compared to the $ 20000 surface tables ,COMMA or anything like that .PERIOD
Or maybe even the $ 2 mouse gesture system at that time was costing around $ 5000 ?QUESTIONMARK
No ,COMMA this theory comes from an expert on barnacles and worms and pigeon breeding ,COMMA and you know who I mean :COLON Charles Darwin .PERIOD
Taste for both natural beauty and for the arts travel across cultures with great ease .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA I personally have no doubt whatsoever that the experience of beauty ,COMMA with its emotional intensity and pleasure ,COMMA belongs to our evolved human psychology .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA keeping these ideas firmly in mind ,COMMA we can say that the experience of beauty is one of the ways that evolution has of arousing and sustaining interest or fascination ,COMMA even obsession ,COMMA in order to encourage us toward making the most adaptive decisions for survival and reproduction .PERIOD
Beauty is nature's way of acting at a distance ,COMMA so to speak .PERIOD
Consider briefly an important source of aesthetic pleasure ,COMMA the magnetic pull of beautiful landscapes .PERIOD
Their symmetry ,COMMA their attractive materials and ,COMMA above all ,COMMA their meticulous workmanship are simply quite beautiful to our eyes ,COMMA even today .PERIOD
Competently made hand axes indicated desirable personal qualities -- intelligence ,COMMA fine motor control ,COMMA planning ability ,COMMA conscientiousness and sometimes access to rare materials .PERIOD
So before I talk about this car for the blind ,COMMA let me briefly tell you about another project that I worked on called the DARPA Urban Challenge .PERIOD
Now this was about building a robotic car that can drive itself .PERIOD
So it's a small tablet ,COMMA has many holes in it ,COMMA and compressed air comes out ,COMMA so it can actually draw images .PERIOD
And he's [unclear] following that van that's out in front of him .PERIOD
So since we started this project ,COMMA we've been getting hundreds of letters ,COMMA emails ,COMMA phone calls from people from all around the world .PERIOD
But potentially more important than this is the tremendous value of the spin-off technology that can come from this project .PERIOD
Why do we call it that ?QUESTIONMARK
I don't know ,COMMA Taiwan Straits 2025 .PERIOD
Let's talk about an enemy embedded within that battle space .PERIOD
They said we couldn't do Iraq .PERIOD
You have to create internal partners .PERIOD You have to access coalition partners .PERIOD

I wanted to just talk for one minute about the future of biotechnology ,COMMA because I think I know very little about that -- I'm not a biologist -- so everything I know about it can be said in one minute .PERIOD

But we can look outside ,COMMA very cheaply and in a simple fashion .PERIOD

There is something called pit lamping .PERIOD
So these creatures will be bright against the cold surroundings .PERIOD
I call these creatures sunflowers .PERIOD
If we don't find them ,COMMA then we can create them ourselves .PERIOD
In the long run ,COMMA of course ,COMMA it would also make it possible for us to move out there .PERIOD
But in the long run ,COMMA if there's no life there ,COMMA we create it ourselves .PERIOD
So again ,COMMA we have a big and wonderful future to look forward .PERIOD
Thank you .PERIOD
And I realized then I had to go to design school .PERIOD
or What's this Num Lock key for ?QUESTIONMARK You know ,COMMA that thing ?QUESTIONMARK

Much of my life has been a quest to get some answers to these questions .PERIOD
I was born and raised here in India ,COMMA and I learned from an early age to be deeply suspicious of the aunties and uncles who would bend down ,COMMA pat us on the head and then say to my parents with no problem at all ,COMMA Poor things .PERIOD You only have three daughters .PERIOD
Late that night ,COMMA I heard my mother begging my father ,COMMA Please do something Ramu .PERIOD Can't you intervene ?QUESTIONMARK

The world Layma Bowie was given was a world at war .PERIOD
At the next Friday sermon ,COMMA the women who were sitting in the side room of the mosque began to share their distress at the state of affairs .PERIOD
In a now famous CNN clip ,COMMA you can see them sitting on the ground ,COMMA their arms linked .PERIOD
The police are called in to physically remove the women .PERIOD
And then you realize that by integrating aspects of tradition and community into their struggles ,COMMA women like Sakena and Leah and Layma -- but also women like Sonia Gandhi here in India and Michelle Bachelet in Chile and Shirin Ebadi in Iran -- are doing something else .PERIOD
And the first thing I wanted to do as a Muslim was go to Mecca and visit the Kaaba ,COMMA the holiest shrine of Islam .PERIOD
And I did that ;SEMICOLON I put on my ritualistic dress ;SEMICOLON I went to the holy mosque ;SEMICOLON I did my prayers ;SEMICOLON I observed all the rituals .PERIOD
In other words ,COMMA men and women were worshiping all together .PERIOD
And I think it's not an accident that you don't find this idea in the very origin of Islam .PERIOD
On the other hand ,COMMA the Westerners who look at Islamic culture and see some troubling aspects should not readily conclude that this is what Islam ordains .PERIOD
And the religious police imposes the supposed Islamic way of life on every citizen ,COMMA by force -- like women are forced to cover their heads -- wear the hijab ,COMMA the Islamic head cover .PERIOD
Let me give you an example :COLON in Turkey where I come from ,COMMA which is a very hyper-secular republic ,COMMA until very recently we used to have what I call secularism police ,COMMA which would guard the universities against veiled students .PERIOD
In other words ,COMMA they would force students to uncover their heads ,COMMA and I think forcing people to uncover their head is as tyrannical as forcing them to cover it .PERIOD
Which means that Muslims can ,COMMA today ,COMMA look at those things and say ,COMMA Well ,COMMA the core of our religion is here to stay with us .PERIOD
And even the very extreme forms of Islamism led to terrorism in the name of Islam -- which is actually a practice that I think is against Islam ,COMMA but some ,COMMA obviously ,COMMA extremists did not think that way .PERIOD
And I think the West ,COMMA at least some powers in the West ,COMMA particularly the United States ,COMMA made the mistake of supporting those secular dictators ,COMMA thinking that they were more helpful for their interests .PERIOD
Secondly ,COMMA in the past two decades ,COMMA thanks to globalization ,COMMA thanks to the market economy ,COMMA thanks to the rise of a middle-class ,COMMA we in Turkey see what I define as a rebirth of Islamic modernism .PERIOD
As a photographer for National Geographic ,COMMA I've portrayed it for many .PERIOD
And where that energy touches water ,COMMA something new emerges :COLON life .PERIOD
Shallow seas nurtured life early on ,COMMA and that's where it morphed into more complex forms .PERIOD
The fundamental forms of ferns followed ,COMMA to bear spores that foreshadowed seeds .PERIOD
Leatherbacks and tuataras are echoes from that era .PERIOD
Jurassic Park still shimmers in part of Madagascar ,COMMA and the center of Brazil ,COMMA where plants called cycads remain rock hard .PERIOD
Flamingos covered continents .PERIOD Migrations got underway .PERIOD
Water lilies were among the first .PERIOD
In Africa ,COMMA Gondwana molded Proteas .PERIOD
Tropical rainforests arose ,COMMA sparking new layers of interdependence .PERIOD
a trick shared by the largest flower on Earth .PERIOD
An asteroid hits ,COMMA and the world went down in flames .PERIOD
Primates emerge from jungles ,COMMA as tarsiers first ,COMMA becoming lemurs not much later .PERIOD
And you all here today can imagine and will shape where we go next .PERIOD
Today I want to talk to you about ethnic conflict and civil war .PERIOD
But let's start at the beginning .PERIOD
Well ,COMMA notwithstanding the gloomy pictures from the Middle East ,COMMA Darfur ,COMMA Iraq ,COMMA elsewhere ,COMMA there is a longer-term trend that does represent some good news .PERIOD
The news about civilian casualties is also less bad than it used to be .PERIOD
Thus ,COMMA even though every civilian killed ,COMMA maimed ,COMMA raped ,COMMA or tortured is one too many ,COMMA the fact that the number of civilian casualties is clearly lower today than it was a decade ago ,COMMA is good news .PERIOD
But let's look at the good news again .PERIOD
But then ,COMMA is Northern Ireland a unique example ,COMMA or does this kind of explanation only hold more generally in democratic and developed countries ?QUESTIONMARK
A final example :COLON Kosovo .PERIOD
Central among them are three .PERIOD
By the same token -- and here we have some good news again -- the very fact that there is a high-level ,COMMA well-resourced international presence in Kosovo and the Balkans region more generally and the fact that local leaders on both sides have showed relative restraint ,COMMA explains why things have not been worse over the past two years since 2008 .PERIOD
A final thought :COLON Ending civil wars is a process that is fraught with dangers ,COMMA frustrations and setbacks .PERIOD
Thank you .PERIOD
I'm going to talk about some of my discoveries around the world through my work .PERIOD
And at that young age ,COMMA 10 years old ,COMMA Benki became the paje of his community .PERIOD
He went 3000 miles on an odyssey to Rio to the Earth Summit to tell the world what was happening in his tiny ,COMMA little corner .PERIOD
Benki came back to his village full of ideas -- new technologies ,COMMA new research ,COMMA new ways of understanding what was going on .PERIOD
He's built schools to teach children to care for the forest .PERIOD
Together ,COMMA he's led the reforestation of over 25 percent of the land that had been destroyed by the loggers .PERIOD
Why are you putting yourself at risk ?QUESTIONMARK
So when I think of that ,COMMA I wonder what our grandchildren and our great-grandchildren ,COMMA when they ask themselves that question ,COMMA I wonder how they will answer .PERIOD
For me ,COMMA the world is veering towards a future we don't much want when we really think about it deep inside .PERIOD
You also know that we can't just keep doing what we've always done ,COMMA because we'll get the results we've always gotten .PERIOD
We have to change .PERIOD
It's imperative to me ,COMMA when I look around the world ,COMMA that we need to change ourselves .PERIOD
Sanghamitra didn't start life as a leader of an NGO ,COMMA she started her career as university professor ,COMMA teaching English literature .PERIOD
They take care of 20000 -odd people today in over 1000 villages around Karnataka .PERIOD
They've pioneered a different approach to villages .PERIOD
Instead of handing out information in pamphlets ,COMMA as is so often the case ,COMMA they bring theater troupes ,COMMA songs ,COMMA music ,COMMA dance .PERIOD
Sanghamitra told me just last week -- she had just come back from two weeks in the villages ,COMMA and she had a real breakthrough .PERIOD
He has nine other buildings -- that are already open to the public -- filled to the rafters with artifacts documenting contemporary Chinese history .PERIOD
They looked outside ,COMMA and then they changed what was on the inside .PERIOD
They've gone away from what they did before ,COMMA and they've gone to something they didn't know .PERIOD
He went around once ,COMMA he went around twice ,COMMA he went around thrice .PERIOD
And so ,COMMA when you study it ,COMMA you realize that different people of the world have a different understanding of the world .PERIOD
Perhaps he was a Jain monk ,COMMA like Bahubali over here ,COMMA the Gomateshwara Bahubali whose image is not far from Mysore .PERIOD
Alexander asked ,COMMA What are you doing ?QUESTIONMARK
And they both laughed .PERIOD
What should you not be ?QUESTIONMARK
You should not be Sisyphus ,COMMA who rolls a rock up a mountain all day only to find the boulder rolled down at night .PERIOD
And he wanted to hoist his flag to say ,COMMA I was here first .PERIOD
This was the mythology of the gymnosophist .PERIOD
But they were not two characters on two different adventures .PERIOD
You see ,COMMA the Indians also had a river that separates the land of the living from the land of the dead .PERIOD
You go again and again and again .PERIOD
Two different mythologies ,COMMA two different ways of looking at the world .PERIOD
And I believe it is this mythological paradigm that inspired Indian mathematicians to discover the number zero .PERIOD
Who knows ?QUESTIONMARK
Standard business model :COLON vision ,COMMA mission ,COMMA values ,COMMA processes .PERIOD
You see ,COMMA this is what India is today .PERIOD The ground reality is based on a cyclical world view .PERIOD
I have personally experienced it .PERIOD I'm trained as a medical doctor .PERIOD
And he knew very intuitively ,COMMA that best practices ,COMMA developed in Japan and China and Europe and America will not work in India .PERIOD
You can't measure it .PERIOD You can't manage it .PERIOD
After a leader completes his training and is about to take over the store ,COMMA we blindfold him ,COMMA we surround him with the stakeholders ,COMMA the customer ,COMMA his family ,COMMA his team ,COMMA his boss .PERIOD
That sensitivity is what we need .PERIOD Once this belief enters ,COMMA behavior will happen ,COMMA business will happen .PERIOD
But that was interesting in itself .PERIOD This is companies like Vonage .PERIOD
The little box has your phone number .PERIOD
It's really cute seeing middle-aged people like me ,COMMA try out Skype for the first time ,COMMA which is usually when their kid goes away for a semester abroad .PERIOD
They don't want to pay the international fees ,COMMA so they're like ,COMMA Timmy !EXCLAMATIONMARK Is that you ?QUESTIONMARK
Imagine if you had an ordinary cell phone ,COMMA and any time you were in a wireless hotspot -- free calls anywhere in the world ,COMMA never pay the cellular company a nickel .PERIOD
And when you're out of the hotspot ,COMMA you're on the regular cellular network .PERIOD
You're thinking ,COMMA Well ,COMMA how often am I in a hotspot ?QUESTIONMARK
Because they give you a regular wireless router that works with the phone ,COMMA for your house .PERIOD
They don't have that kind of money .PERIOD Instead they give each of us a seven-dollar-and- 95 -cent box .PERIOD They're like a stealth tower installation program .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA I'm leaving the house .PERIOD DP :COLON I'm going for a walk -- do you mind ?QUESTIONMARK
I don't know why my wife says I never listen to her .PERIOD I don't get that .PERIOD
I have two cellphones ,COMMA so this going to be very odd ,COMMA if it works .PERIOD
Excuse me one second .PERIOD
All right !EXCLAMATIONMARK We've made the point .PERIOD
The beauty of that is you never miss a call .PERIOD
Google bought it ,COMMA and they've been working on it for a year .PERIOD
I actually got a photograph of the Verizon employee right there .PERIOD
Anyway ,COMMA so lets say you need a drugstore near Chicago .PERIOD
Here it comes .PERIOD
And it's already written down -- so ,COMMA like ,COMMA if you're driving ,COMMA you don't have to do one of these things ,COMMA Uh huh ,COMMA uh huh ,COMMA uh huh .PERIOD
Shortly I'll tell you why I was in Milan .PERIOD
That's cute .PERIOD I do have an email address .PERIOD You can just ask me .PERIOD
It's absolutely phenomenal .PERIOD The only downside is that it requires you to know how to text -- send a text message .PERIOD Nobody over 40 knows how to do that .PERIOD
So I'm going to teach you something even better .PERIOD
They put this teeny-weeny little ad ,COMMA about 10 characters long .PERIOD
Because there is one !EXCLAMATIONMARK
As you can imagine ,COMMA it's college kids and old people .PERIOD
When I call to leave you a message ,COMMA I get 15 seconds of instructions from a third-grade teacher on Ambien !EXCLAMATIONMARK
So now I'm going to tell you how to get out of that .PERIOD
The reason I think that is that on the first day I tried one of these services ,COMMA I got two voicemail messages .PERIOD One was from a guy named Michael Stevenson ,COMMA which shouldn't be that hard to transcribe ,COMMA and it was misspelled .PERIOD
I love my job .PERIOD
I'm not kidding you .PERIOD The message said ,COMMA Was walking along the street and sky was blue and emergency !EXCLAMATIONMARK
And lastly ,COMMA I just have to talk about this one .PERIOD
Phone :COLON Well ,COMMA that's good .PERIOD
What are you doing ?QUESTIONMARK
Actually ,COMMA even so ,COMMA he was turned down by Verizon and others .PERIOD
It's got bad things and good things .PERIOD Lets all acknowledge that right now .PERIOD
It's absurd .PERIOD We have power outlets in every room of every building .PERIOD We have running water .PERIOD
You type in what you want ,COMMA and it gives you the translation .PERIOD
I know .PERIOD It's insane ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK
It will immediately play you that song or that band .PERIOD
If you like that one ,COMMA or don't like it ,COMMA you do thumbs-up and thumbs-down .PERIOD Over time it tailors the songs so that it completely stops playing bad songs .PERIOD
It proposes a restaurant .PERIOD
And now the end is near .PERIOD
I want an iPhone .PERIOD
Who cares if it's AT&ampT ?QUESTIONMARK
Because the breast has become are very political organ .PERIOD
I will do my best this morning to tell you what I think is the truth .PERIOD
But first ,COMMA my disclosures .PERIOD
She came to see me after discovering a breast lump .PERIOD
You may recall a year ago when a firestorm erupted after the United States Preventive Services Task Force reviewed the world's mammography screening literature and issued a guideline recommending against screening mammograms in women in their 40 s .PERIOD
Screening the average young woman with an MRI is kind of like driving to the grocery store in a Hummer .PERIOD
But the problem was that the gamma detectors were these huge ,COMMA bulky tubes ,COMMA and they were filled with these scintillating crystals ,COMMA and you just couldn't get them close enough around the breast to find small tumors .PERIOD
To say that we faced high doses of skepticism in those early years is just a huge understatement ,COMMA but we were so convinced that we might be able to make this work that we chipped away with incremental modifications to this system .PERIOD
The patient receives an injection of a radio tracer that's taken up by rapidly proliferating tumor cells ,COMMA but not by normal cells ,COMMA and this is the key difference from mammography .PERIOD
Our big break came in 2004 .PERIOD
After we had demonstrated that we could find small tumors ,COMMA we used these images to submit a grant to the Susan G .PERIOD Komen Foundation .PERIOD
And we were elated when they took a chance on a team of completely unknown investigators and funded us to study 1000 women with dense breasts ,COMMA comparing a screening mammogram to an MBI .PERIOD
Here's an example from that screening study .PERIOD
It takes a radiologist years of specialty training to become expert in differentiating the normal anatomic detail from the worrisome finding .PERIOD
But I suspect even the non-radiologists in the room can find the tumor on the MBI image .PERIOD
After the fourth rejection ,COMMA we requested reconsideration of the manuscript ,COMMA because we strongly suspected that one of the reviewers who had rejected it had a financial conflict of interest in a competing technology .PERIOD
Some women who develop breast cancer die from it many years later ,COMMA and most women ,COMMA thankfully ,COMMA survive .PERIOD
So I worked with white noise .PERIOD
And do not be disturbed any more by the other aggressive sound .PERIOD
But it is just physiology .PERIOD It's just in your brain .PERIOD
So in order to make this white noise a little bit active and reactive ,COMMA I create a ball ,COMMA a rolling ball able to analyze and find where does aggressive sound come from ,COMMA and roll ,COMMA at home or at work ,COMMA towards aggressive noise ,COMMA and emits white noise in order to neutralize it .PERIOD
A loving dispute with your girl or boyfriend .PERIOD
Anyway ,COMMA in this same kind of approach ,COMMA I designed K .PERIOD
I'm just a designer .PERIOD So I need them .PERIOD
And the irony for me was of course ,COMMA I didn't do that for the sake of science progress .PERIOD
I just do that to make money .PERIOD
So we took too many of them .PERIOD
This one is an antibiotic .PERIOD
But in this case it is not the medication that is dependent on the patient .PERIOD
So the idea is ,COMMA all night long the elastic skin of the third lung will slowly inflate itself ,COMMA including air and molecules ,COMMA for sure .PERIOD
You have to know ,COMMA or you probably already know ,COMMA that indoor air pollution is more toxic than outdoor one .PERIOD
So while I'm talking to you ,COMMA the seats you are sit on are currently emitting some invisible and odorless toxic gas .PERIOD Sorry for that .PERIOD
So your sofa ,COMMA your plastic chair ,COMMA your kid's toys give their own invisible reality .PERIOD And this one is very toxic .PERIOD
This one is kind of the same approach because I include ,COMMA in a product like Andrea ,COMMA some plants .PERIOD
Indeed ,COMMA this object is a domestic farm ,COMMA for fishes and green .PERIOD
So the idea of this object is to be able to get at home very local food .PERIOD
After ,COMMA it goes back into the fish tank .PERIOD
Now we can eat local food .PERIOD
See ,COMMA like this one ?QUESTIONMARK
You can see it there .PERIOD
We're the new technologists .PERIOD
I think about World War II -- some of our great technologists then ,COMMA some of our great physicists ,COMMA studying nuclear fission and fusion -- just nuclear stuff .PERIOD
We want the people building the technology thinking about what we should be doing with the technology .PERIOD
So we can protect ourselves if he was up to no good ?QUESTIONMARK
So to get people warmed up ,COMMA let's start with an easy question -- something I'm sure everybody here has an opinion about :COLON iPhone versus Android .PERIOD
But he was worried that all we seem to be doing is trading opinions about this .PERIOD
In math ,COMMA we know the objective facts .PERIOD
It's an objective truth about the form of two ,COMMA the abstract form .PERIOD
Then you would know what was really just and what wasn't .PERIOD
If you think that way ,COMMA you have a Platonist moral framework .PERIOD
He thought it was impractical .PERIOD
It's just a matter of the consequences .PERIOD
Kant was very good on this point ,COMMA and he said it a little better than I'll say it .PERIOD
What should we be doing ?QUESTIONMARK What's the answer ?QUESTIONMARK
There's not a formula .PERIOD
And don't just find another technologist friend ;SEMICOLON find somebody different than you .PERIOD
We care what happens in that opera .PERIOD
In the early ' 80 s ,COMMA some would say .PERIOD
The gang had no way to make money .PERIOD
So he was a math major in college who had a good heart ,COMMA and decided he wanted to get a sociology PhD ,COMMA came to the University of Chicago .PERIOD
And ,COMMA in his own words ,COMMA he looked like a freak .PERIOD
So he showed up at the University of Chicago .PERIOD
There was a lot of gunfire ;SEMICOLON there were a lot of philosophical discussions he had with the gang members .PERIOD
And you and I ,COMMA probably ,COMMA faced with the situation ,COMMA would think ,COMMA well ,COMMA I guess I'm going to write my dissertation on The Grateful Dead .PERIOD
But the thing that really makes the gang seem like McDonald's is its franchisees .PERIOD
So what do the wages look like ?QUESTIONMARK So you might be surprised .PERIOD
We found in our gang -- and ,COMMA admittedly ,COMMA this was not really sort of a standard situation ;SEMICOLON this was a time of intense violence -- of a lot of gang wars -- as this gang actually became quite successful .PERIOD But there were costs .PERIOD
That makes you pause -- gives you some pause -- those of you who believe that a death penalty's going to have an enormous deterrent effect on crime .PERIOD
That the young people controlled the gang -- that ,COMMA as you got older ,COMMA you dropped out of the gang .PERIOD
So what happened was ,COMMA the people who happened to be in the right place at the right time -- the people who happened to be leading the gang in the mid- to late ' 80 s -- became very ,COMMA very wealthy .PERIOD
You know ,COMMA he would say to his friends ,COMMA Hey ,COMMA look at all the money I got in the gang .PERIOD
Often ,COMMA our theories fail quite miserably when we go to the data .PERIOD
This is one of the basic ideas in labor economics ,COMMA called a compensating differential .PERIOD
It's why we think garbage men might be paid more than people who work in parks ,COMMA OK ?QUESTIONMARK
So in the words of one of the members of the gang I think makes this clear .PERIOD
And the words of a gang member capture it quite nicely .PERIOD
If you start taking losses ,COMMA they see you as weak and shit .PERIOD
And I thought about it ,COMMA and I said ,COMMA CEOs often pay themselves million-dollar bonuses ,COMMA even when companies are losing a lot of money .PERIOD
Also different aerobatic maneuvers are possible with a paraglider .PERIOD
You can see the skydiver with the red suit ,COMMA he's in a stand-up position .PERIOD
This is a jump I did in Rio de Janeiro .PERIOD
2005 I did a BASE jump from the Eiger ,COMMA from the Monk and from the Jungfrau ,COMMA three very famous mountains in Switzerland .PERIOD
June Cohen :COLON I have some questions .PERIOD
Yet .PERIOD But people are trying .PERIOD Are you among those -- you're not going to commit -- are you among those trying to do it ?QUESTIONMARK
It's a dream .PERIOD It's a dream .PERIOD Yeah .PERIOD
And is that how you usually fly ?QUESTIONMARK
Do people come to you with projects and say ,COMMA We want you to do this !EXCLAMATIONMARK
I don't necessarily think the film is so interesting .PERIOD
The show was ,COMMA in a sense ,COMMA about that .PERIOD
I also put a mirror in the ceiling ,COMMA and some fog ,COMMA some haze .PERIOD
And what happens is that people ,COMMA they start to see themselves in this space .PERIOD
What does it matter ?QUESTIONMARK
It makes a difference whether you say ,COMMA I'm a part of this city .PERIOD
It's quite simple and fundamental .PERIOD
It doesn't really tell you what you're looking at .PERIOD
Or is that a three-hour hike ,COMMA or is that a whole day I'm looking at ?QUESTIONMARK
If you have a waterfall in there ,COMMA right out there at the horizon ;SEMICOLON you look at the waterfall and you go ,COMMA Oh ,COMMA the water is falling really slowly .PERIOD
And experience is not just a kind of entertainment in a non-casual way .PERIOD
So art ,COMMA in that sense ,COMMA I think holds an incredible relevance in the world in which we're moving into ,COMMA particularly right now .PERIOD
What I really enjoyed about this project is reviving these people's words .PERIOD
So ,COMMA what we're going to do next is a poem that was written by Nathalia Crane .PERIOD
The next poem is If No One Ever Marries Me .PERIOD
He went there after the death of his wife of smallpox and brought his two young children .PERIOD
Just bring it down a little .PERIOD
Thank you so much .PERIOD
Or this idea of the misunderstood genius ,COMMA frustrated that the world doesn't fit in with his or her ideas .PERIOD
And quite often we sit in a design meeting and we discover that there is this great idea .PERIOD
But for another client in another culture ,COMMA it could really be the right answer to a different question .PERIOD
And they chose this mascot because the theme of the expo is Better City ,COMMA Better Life .PERIOD
But then we looked at recent urban development ,COMMA and we noticed that this is like a Shanghai street ,COMMA 30 years ago .PERIOD All bikes ,COMMA no cars .PERIOD
So if you come to the expo ,COMMA go straight to the Danish pavilion ,COMMA get a Danish bike ,COMMA and then continue on that to visit the other pavilions .PERIOD
And in the middle of this sort of harbor bath ,COMMA we're actually going to put the actual Little Mermaid .PERIOD
So the second story that I'd like to tell is ,COMMA actually starts in my own house .PERIOD
And we discovered that by controlling the size of the holes ,COMMA we could actually turn the entire facade into a gigantic ,COMMA naturally ventilated ,COMMA rasterized image .PERIOD
It has no water .PERIOD It has no energy ,COMMA no resources .PERIOD
They accumulate the solar energy .PERIOD
Yes ,COMMA maybe just to round off .PERIOD
I'm just going to list some of them .PERIOD
Where should we start on solving these problems ?QUESTIONMARK
To climate change that would be like Kyoto .PERIOD
I'd love to go into ,COMMA and get you to think about this process ,COMMA and that's actually what we did .PERIOD
Of course ,COMMA you have to ask yourself ,COMMA why on Earth was such a list never done before ?QUESTIONMARK
Nobody wants to do this .PERIOD
We'd like to know these things .PERIOD
Three of the world's top experts saying ,COMMA what can we do ?QUESTIONMARK
What would be the price ?QUESTIONMARK
And of course ,COMMA I'm very happy you asked that question -- -- because that's a very good question .PERIOD
This offends a lot of people ,COMMA and that's probably one of the things where people will say I shouldn't come back ,COMMA either .PERIOD
And I'd like to talk about that ,COMMA because that's really curious .PERIOD
The reason why they came up with saying that Kyoto -- or doing something more than Kyoto -- is a bad deal is simply because it's very inefficient .PERIOD
It's not to say that if we had all the money in the world ,COMMA we wouldn't want to do it .PERIOD
There are many problems out there in the world .PERIOD
And what I want to make sure of is ,COMMA if we actually focus on problems ,COMMA that we focus on the right ones .PERIOD
The ones where we can do a lot of good rather than a little good .PERIOD
And of course ,COMMA we'll be even richer than that .PERIOD
We have ,COMMA you know ,COMMA The Day After Tomorrow -- it looks great ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK
It's not about making things that have the most media attention ,COMMA but it's about making places where we can actually do the most good .PERIOD
But the point ,COMMA of course ,COMMA is still to say ,COMMA if you get another 100 billion dollars ,COMMA we still want to spend that in the best possible way ,COMMA don't we ?QUESTIONMARK
So we actually invited 80 young people from all over the world to come and solve the same problem .PERIOD
My studio in Bali was only 10 minutes away from a monkey forest ,COMMA and monkeys ,COMMA of course ,COMMA are supposed to be the happiest of all animals .PERIOD
The serif is not really in place .PERIOD
And the rider thinks that he can tell the elephant what to do ,COMMA but the elephant really has his own ideas .PERIOD
And from that point of view we turned it into a lovely project .PERIOD
We stir this in until it's completely dissolved and then pour it into a growth bath .PERIOD
And then we're ready to add the living organism .PERIOD
And actually ,COMMA in hot weather ,COMMA I can just grow it outside .PERIOD
But I do think it could be quite a smart and sustainable addition to our increasingly precious natural resources .PERIOD
Thank you very much .PERIOD
Suzanne Lee .PERIOD
I made contact with a child from Swat who studied in a madrassa like this .PERIOD
How do the Taliban in your area get people to join them ?QUESTIONMARK
Then they take us to a madrassa and teach us things from the Koran .PERIOD
They ask us to use them only against the infidels .PERIOD
SOC :COLON I ,COMMA in my research ,COMMA have seen that the Taliban have perfected the way in which they recruit and train children ,COMMA and I think it's a five-step process .PERIOD
These children are explicitly forbidden from reading newspapers ,COMMA listening to radio ,COMMA reading any books that the teachers do not prescribe them .PERIOD
Effectively ,COMMA the Taliban create a complete blackout of any other source of information for these children .PERIOD
He blew himself up ,COMMA killing six .PERIOD
Two years ago here at TED I reported that we had discovered at Saturn ,COMMA with the Cassini Spacecraft ,COMMA an anomalously warm and geologically active region at the southern tip of the small Saturnine moon Enceladus ,COMMA seen here .PERIOD
While they're not amino acids ,COMMA we're now finding things like propane and benzene ,COMMA hydrogen cyanide ,COMMA and formaldehyde .PERIOD
So we are very encouraged by these results .PERIOD
And this is quite an extraordinary idea ,COMMA but it is reality today .PERIOD
This was created by an architectural firm called Shiro .PERIOD
And you can actually walk into it .PERIOD
Now 3 D printing can break away barriers in design which challenge the constraints of mass production .PERIOD
There's a lower chance of rejection .PERIOD
The piece of software will keep an individual within the bounds of the possible .PERIOD
I don't think that will happen soon .PERIOD
We're now ,COMMA instead of shipping a product across the world ,COMMA we're sending data across the Internet .PERIOD
And applying this to the idea of building up what's in our bodies .PERIOD
So one of the pioneers ,COMMA for example ,COMMA is Dr .PERIOD Anthony Atala ,COMMA and he has been working on layering cells to create body parts -- bladders ,COMMA valves ,COMMA kidneys .PERIOD
We like different things .PERIOD
I've been working on issues of poverty for more than 20 years ,COMMA and so it's ironic that the problem that and question that I most grapple with is how you actually define poverty .PERIOD What does it mean ?QUESTIONMARK
And I would see kids on the street corners ,COMMA and they'd say Obama ,COMMA he's our brother !EXCLAMATIONMARK
And she said ,COMMA You know ,COMMA the poverty wasn't so bad .PERIOD It was the humiliation and the embarrassment of it all .PERIOD
And I say ,COMMA 'Look at me .PERIOD You are not dead .PERIOD
And in the middle of this economic crisis ,COMMA where so many of us are inclined to pull in with fear ,COMMA I think we're well suited to take a cue from Jane and reach out ,COMMA recognizing that being poor doesn't mean being ordinary .PERIOD
It was a really big excitement for me to get into Caltech .PERIOD
And I concluded ,COMMA after researching every other technology that we could deploy for storing energy -- flywheels ,COMMA different formulations of batteries -- it just wasn't practical to store energy .PERIOD
There are a lot of new things that are happening to do that ,COMMA but fundamentally the process requires a tremendous amount of energy .PERIOD
So I tried to figure out what other way could we try and make cost-effective solar electricity .PERIOD
Traditionally ,COMMA concentrators look like this .PERIOD
Your efficiency goes down with more bounces ,COMMA because you lose about 10 percent with each bounce ,COMMA but this allowed us to collect light from a plus or minus 25 degree angle .PERIOD
So ,COMMA once you have mobility ,COMMA now you're making a lot of engines because you've got lots of units ,COMMA as opposed to steam ships or big factories where you're not making as many units ,COMMA so this was the engine that ended up benefiting from mass production where all the other engines didn't benefit .PERIOD
So we tried to look at the Stirling engine in a new way ,COMMA because it was practical -- weight no longer mattered for our application The internal combustion engine took off because weight mattered because you were moving around .PERIOD
So someone came up with a very clever idea ,COMMA to -- instead of heating the whole cylinder and cooling the whole cylinder ,COMMA what about if you put a displacer inside -- a little thing that shuttles the air back and forth .PERIOD
We measured each one ,COMMA we readjusted the model to what we measured ,COMMA and then we led that to the current prototype .PERIOD
It led to a very compact ,COMMA inexpensive engine ,COMMA and this is what the engine looks like .PERIOD
So an example of that is ,COMMA here's the map of the United States .PERIOD
And of course ,COMMA look at Africa .PERIOD
There's 10000 watts of light pouring on the stage ,COMMA one horsepower is 756 watts ,COMMA at full power .PERIOD
But ,COMMA everywhere around us we have insatiable use for energy because it's so cheap .PERIOD
And it's cheap because we've been subsidized by energy that's been concentrated by the sun .PERIOD
Headlines that look like this when they have to do with climate change ,COMMA and headlines that look like this when they have to do with air quality or smog .PERIOD
And this is the tower from below .PERIOD
So ,COMMA as you can imagine ,COMMA the inside of this aircraft doesn't look like any plane you would take on vacation .PERIOD
We do all of this to understand the chemistry of one molecule .PERIOD
What I am always thinking about is what this session is about ,COMMA which is called simplicity .PERIOD
So ,COMMA I was fortunate enough to be born a very dreamy child .PERIOD
And that was a good thing to help ,COMMA you know ,COMMA the cause .PERIOD
But ,COMMA then he came back ,COMMA and things happened ,COMMA and I decided I really hated my writing ,COMMA that it was awful ,COMMA awful ,COMMA purple prose .PERIOD
Well ,COMMA Tibor really started the studio ,COMMA called M&ampCo .PERIOD
That to be able to talk about content ,COMMA to break apart what you normally expect ,COMMA to use humor and surprise ,COMMA elegance and humanity in your work was really important to us .PERIOD
I don't really -- I mean ,COMMA I could tell you that I didn't understand ,COMMA I'm not proud of it ,COMMA but I didn't understand let's say 95 percent of the talks at this conference .PERIOD
So ,COMMA I'm open to the possibilities of not knowing and finding out something new .PERIOD
And so ,COMMA I was able to put that into this story ,COMMA which is an alphabet ,COMMA and hopefully go on to something else .PERIOD
I work for the New Yorker ,COMMA and I do covers ,COMMA and 9 / 11 happened and it was ,COMMA you know ,COMMA a complete and utter end of the world as we knew it .PERIOD
We hoped we'd be funny ,COMMA but we didn't know it would be a cover ,COMMA and we didn't know that that image ,COMMA at the moment that it happened ,COMMA would be something that would be so wonderful for a lot of people .PERIOD
And David Remnick ,COMMA who was really wonderful about it ,COMMA had one problem .PERIOD He didn't like Al Zheimers ,COMMA because he thought it would insult people with Alzheimer's .PERIOD
And ,COMMA He noticed a large stain in the center of the rug .PERIOD
So ,COMMA what I did when I was painting was I started singing ,COMMA because I really adore singing ,COMMA and I think that music is the highest form of all art .PERIOD
I happen to know it for a fact .PERIOD
Maybe amongst themselves they had a few good laughs ,COMMA but Stalin was a paranoid man ,COMMA even more than my father .PERIOD
Which I think I made up ,COMMA which is a good thing .PERIOD
I received a box in the mail and it was wrapped with newspaper and there was the picture of the man on the newspaper and he was dead .PERIOD
And I really spend a lot of time wondering ,COMMA how much truth do we tell ?QUESTIONMARK
How do we know when we are ourselves ?QUESTIONMARK
A quote by Bertrand Russell ,COMMA All the labor of all the ages ,COMMA all the devotion ,COMMA all the inspiration ,COMMA all the noonday brightness of human genius are destined to extinction .PERIOD
And I would like to run it for them .PERIOD
And it says ,COMMA Ich habe genug ,COMMA which is a Bach cantata ,COMMA which I once thought meant I've had it ,COMMA I can't take it anymore ,COMMA give me a break ,COMMA but I was wrong .PERIOD
I thought that things would be pretty fun and there would be more things to play with .PERIOD
So ,COMMA since we've been here this week ,COMMA we've taken millions of breaths ,COMMA collectively ,COMMA and perhaps we haven't witnessed any course changes happening in our lives ,COMMA but we often miss the very subtle changes .PERIOD
So we threw in -- we created a primordial soup with lots of pieces of robots -- with bars ,COMMA with motors ,COMMA with neurons .PERIOD
We're concerned in the national security community ,COMMA and of course in the biology community and the public health community .PERIOD
It's also carried on migration patterns of wild migratory aquatic birds .PERIOD
So what have people been doing with this money ?QUESTIONMARK
Let's everybody run around and play your role .PERIOD
Most local facilities would all be competing to try and get their hands on their piece of the federal stockpile of a drug called Tamiflu ,COMMA which may or may not be helpful -- I'll get into that -- of available vaccines ,COMMA and any other treatments ,COMMA and masks ,COMMA and anything that's been stockpiled .PERIOD
And you'll have massive competition .PERIOD
During the SARS epidemic in Beijing quarantine did seem to help .PERIOD
And their hand got contaminated with the outside of the mask ,COMMA and then they rubbed their nose .PERIOD Bingo !EXCLAMATIONMARK They got SARS .PERIOD
The pandemic circulated three times in 18 months in the absence of commercial air travel .PERIOD
This was based on European and North American data .PERIOD
And that a more likely toll is somewhere in the neighborhood of 80 to 100 million people before we had commercial air travel .PERIOD
So are we ready ?QUESTIONMARK
If you expand that out to think of a whole community ,COMMA or all your employees in your company ,COMMA you begin to realize how limited the Tamiflu option might be .PERIOD
But really ?QUESTIONMARK Do you really have a place to stockpile 18 months worth of food ?QUESTIONMARK Twenty-four months worth of food ?QUESTIONMARK
Do you want to view the pandemic threat the way back in the 1950 s people viewed the civil defense issue ,COMMA and build your own little bomb shelter for pandemic flu ?QUESTIONMARK
And I hope I've convinced you of that ,COMMA which means that the real job is go out and say to your local leaders ,COMMA and your national leaders ,COMMA Why haven't you solved these problems ?QUESTIONMARK
But can you sustain your company that way ?QUESTIONMARK
The moment that you see any evidence of serious human-to-human to transmission .PERIOD
The mechanism isn't clear .PERIOD
Again we don't really know for sure .PERIOD
Audience member :COLON One of the things I've heard is that the real death cause when you get a flu is the associated pneumonia ,COMMA and that a pneumonia vaccine may offer you 50 percent better chance of survival .PERIOD
And so far in the H 5 N 1 cases in people ,COMMA similarly bacterial infection has not been an issue at all .PERIOD
And it won't do any good to bring in the tanks and the artillery because those T-cells don't recognize it either .PERIOD
Now my story has a lot to do with dreaming ,COMMA although I'm known to make my dreams come true .PERIOD
One ,COMMA two ,COMMA three ,COMMA four ,COMMA five ,COMMA six and seven .PERIOD
And I go to see a famous magician and proudly ask him ,COMMA Well what do you think ?QUESTIONMARK
For the move to be professional ,COMMA it has to be less than one second and it has to be perfect .PERIOD
But in America you have to explain .PERIOD What are clubs ?QUESTIONMARK
They have to be precisely lathed .PERIOD
Anyway ,COMMA here I was progressing with my new clubs .PERIOD
The clubs were escaping me at each throw .PERIOD
So I proudly showed him my clubs .PERIOD
He said ,COMMA Philippe ,COMMA you have been had .PERIOD
They are impossible to juggle .PERIOD
I get a pair of pliers and some coat hangers ,COMMA and I gather them together in some kind of ropey path .PERIOD
Well within a few days I'm able to do one crossing .PERIOD
If not ,COMMA I will never do that first step .PERIOD
It's a straight line ,COMMA which sags ,COMMA which sways ,COMMA which vibrates ,COMMA which rolls on itself ,COMMA which is ice ,COMMA which is three tons tight ,COMMA ready to explode ,COMMA ready to swallow me .PERIOD
An inner howl assails me ,COMMA the wild longing to flee .PERIOD
I was not interested in collecting the gigantic ,COMMA in breaking records .PERIOD
And something happened .PERIOD
He didn't know the true story .PERIOD
Trees are wonderful arenas for discovery because of their tall stature ,COMMA their complex structure ,COMMA the biodiversity they foster and their quiet beauty .PERIOD
The most mysterious part of forests is the upper tree canopy .PERIOD
These are not epiphyte roots :COLON these are roots that emerge from the trunk and branch of the host trees themselves .PERIOD
We know it's a lot ,COMMA but we do not yet know the answers to how much ,COMMA and by what processes ,COMMA carbon is being taken out of the atmosphere ,COMMA held in its biomass ,COMMA and moving on through the ecosystem .PERIOD
They ended up making a CD which they took home to their family and friends ,COMMA thereby expressing their own experiences with nature in their own medium .PERIOD
They were incredibly enthusiastic about the work .PERIOD
And they embraced the idea that they could help develop a research design in order to grow these mosses .PERIOD
We gave talks once a month ,COMMA and that actually ended up implementing some amazing sustainability projects at the prisons -- organic gardens ,COMMA worm culture ,COMMA recycling ,COMMA water catchment and beekeeping .PERIOD
As many of you are aware ,COMMA the world of academia is a rather inward-looking one .PERIOD
I'm trying to help researchers move more outward to have their own partnerships with people outside of the academic community .PERIOD
When I look into my heart ,COMMA I see trees -- this is actually an image of a real heart -- there are trees in our hearts ,COMMA there are trees in your hearts .PERIOD
It was taken 18 years ago .PERIOD
There is a problem with scuba though ,COMMA in that it imposes some limitations on how deep you can go ,COMMA and it turns out that depth is about 200 feet .PERIOD
And there's a phenomenon called Henry's Law that says that gases will dissolve into a fluid in proportion to the partial pressures which you're exposing them to .PERIOD
You die also because oxygen toxicity can cause a seizure -- makes you convulse underwater ,COMMA not a good thing to happen underwater .PERIOD
This picture was taken 300 feet deep ,COMMA catching new species of fish .PERIOD
And ,COMMA indeed ,COMMA there is a better way .PERIOD
Alright ,COMMA closed-circuit rebreather -- what is it about it that makes it different from scuba ,COMMA and why is it better ?QUESTIONMARK
Well ,COMMA there are three main advantages to a rebreather .PERIOD
So we need another gas ,COMMA something to dilute the oxygen with .PERIOD
But ,COMMA if we want to go deeper ,COMMA of course ,COMMA we need another gas supply .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA normally you don't have to do that because all of it's done automatically for you with the electronics ,COMMA the third system of a rebreather .PERIOD
And yes ,COMMA it's a little nerve-wracking .PERIOD
So sharks aren't quite as dangerous as most people make them out to be .PERIOD
There's a cover story all about the great explorers of our time .PERIOD
The last article is an article entitled No New Frontiers .PERIOD
Even if you ignore the scientific value of this thing ,COMMA just look at the monetary value of this thing .PERIOD
And then ,COMMA eventually ,COMMA I got around to looking in my bucket .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA this one's pretty cool .PERIOD
So a very large percentage of what is out there isn't really known .PERIOD
We thought we had a handle on all the reef fish diversity -- evidently not .PERIOD
At the beginning I told you that I was going to show you two extraordinary photographs .PERIOD
The reason I show this -- not to put a downer on everything -- but I just want to use it to key off my philosophy of life in general ,COMMA which is that we all have two goals .PERIOD
The first goal we share with every other living thing on this planet ,COMMA which is to survive .PERIOD I call it perpetuation :COLON the survival of the species and survival of ourselves ,COMMA because they're both about perpetuating the genome .PERIOD
You have to balance those two goals .PERIOD
But here's what really perplexed me .PERIOD
But diagnosing a brain disorder without actually looking at the brain is analogous to treating a patient with a heart problem based on their physical symptoms ,COMMA without even doing an ECG or a chest X-ray to look at the heart .PERIOD
Yet ,COMMA despite all the advances in medical technology ,COMMA the diagnosis of brain disorders in one in six children still remained so limited .PERIOD
And then I came across a team at Harvard University that had taken one such advanced medical technology and finally applied it ,COMMA instead of in brain research ,COMMA towards diagnosing brain disorders in children .PERIOD
And another program called Statistical Probability Mapping then performs mathematical calculations to determine whether any of these abnormalities are clinically significant ,COMMA allowing us to provide a much more accurate neurological diagnosis of the child's symptoms .PERIOD
When we used this groundbreaking EEG technology to actually look at Justin's brain ,COMMA the results were startling .PERIOD
But we are now in a new era of neuroscience ,COMMA one in which we can finally look directly at brain function in real time with no risks and no side effects ,COMMA non-invasively ,COMMA and find the true source of so many disabilities in children .PERIOD
It's something like life ,COMMA that once you get in it you can't get out .PERIOD
There are two clips I want to show you ,COMMA the first one is a kind of hodgepodge ,COMMA its just three little moments ,COMMA four little moments with three of the people who are here tonight .PERIOD
It was built entirely by hand off bamboo scaffolding ,COMMA people carrying these baskets of concrete on their heads ,COMMA dumping them in the forms .PERIOD
So ,COMMA those are the two clips I'm going to show .PERIOD

Man :COLON Yes ,COMMA it is the national image of Bangladesh .PERIOD
No ,COMMA he never saw this .PERIOD

Are we alone in this vast universe of energy and matter and chemistry and physics ?QUESTIONMARK
Whether we're born in San Francisco ,COMMA or Sudan ,COMMA or close to the heart of the Milky Way galaxy ,COMMA we are the products of a billion-year lineage of wandering stardust .PERIOD
Well ,COMMA what about 10 ^ 22 ?QUESTIONMARK
That line would have to be 38 million miles above this stage .PERIOD
I think this is what David Deutsch meant in 2005 ,COMMA when he ended his Oxford TEDTalk by saying he had two principles he'd like to share for living ,COMMA and he would like to carve them on stone tablets .PERIOD
We've been searching ever since ,COMMA but it's impossible to overstate the magnitude of the search that remains .PERIOD
And over those long distances ,COMMA its signal is very faint when it reaches us .PERIOD
But this is a simple signal ,COMMA and tomorrow we want to be able to find more complex signals .PERIOD
This is a very good year .PERIOD
2009 is the 400 th anniversary of Galileo's first use of the telescope ,COMMA Darwin's 200 th birthday ,COMMA the 150 th anniversary of the publication of On the Origin of Species ,COMMA the 50 th anniversary of SETI as a science ,COMMA the 25 th anniversary of the incorporation of the SETI Institute as a non-profit ,COMMA and of course ,COMMA the 25 th anniversary of TED .PERIOD
The first step would be to tap into the global brain trust ,COMMA to build an environment where raw data could be stored ,COMMA and where it could be accessed and manipulated ,COMMA where new algorithms could be developed and old algorithms made more efficient .PERIOD
I'm sorry Seth Godin ,COMMA but over the millennia ,COMMA we've seen where tribalism leads .PERIOD
It records the annual rise and fall of greenhouse gases and temperatures going back before the onset of the last ice ages .PERIOD
Ten times a day ,COMMA they extract the 10 -foot long cylinder of compressed ice crystals that contain the unsullied air and trace chemicals laid down by snow ,COMMA season after season for thousands of years .PERIOD
From this ,COMMA we can detect an extraordinary number of things .PERIOD
Imagine juggling a snowball across the tropics .PERIOD
They have to ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA make sure this ice never gets warmer than about 20 degrees below zero ,COMMA otherwise ,COMMA the key gases inside it will dissipate .PERIOD
Early explorers sailed off the edge of the map ,COMMA and they found a place where the normal rules of time and temperature seem suspended .PERIOD
It is a voice of experience .PERIOD

This thesis is set out in a book called Winning the Oil Endgame that four colleagues and I wrote and have posted for free at Oilendgamecom -- about 170000 downloads so far .PERIOD
So when we did ,COMMA we found some very surprising things .PERIOD
And serious competition from Europe ,COMMA from Korea ,COMMA and next is China ,COMMA which will soon be a major net exporter of cars .PERIOD
The point here is ,COMMA these cars are going to be made super efficient .PERIOD
The question is ,COMMA who will make them ?QUESTIONMARK
It's financeable in the private capital market .PERIOD
And in the upper left ,COMMA a pioneering effort 14 years ago by GM -- 84 miles a gallon without even using a hybrid ,COMMA in a four-seater .PERIOD
In the airplane business ,COMMA it's again a similar story where the first 20 percent fuel saving is free ,COMMA as Boeing is now demonstrating in its new Dreamliner .PERIOD
And it turns out that these are quite remarkable for safety .PERIOD
The Golf was totaled .PERIOD
Because these materials could actually absorb six to 12 times as much energy per pound as steel ,COMMA and do so a lot more smoothly .PERIOD
This expands choice rapidly in the market ,COMMA and actually makes more money for automakers as well .PERIOD
I'd like to deal with the lack of affordable personal mobility in this country by making it very cheaply possible for low-income families to get efficient ,COMMA reliable ,COMMA warranted new cars that they could otherwise never get .PERIOD
This creates a new million-car-a-year market for Detroit from customers they weren't going to get otherwise ,COMMA because they weren't creditworthy and could never afford a new car .PERIOD
It turns out that if ,COMMA say ,COMMA African-American and white households had the same car ownership ,COMMA it would cut employment disparity about in half by providing better access to job opportunities .PERIOD
Just turn it over to the private sector ,COMMA and we have an Internet .PERIOD
Ours is on the demand side .PERIOD
I was just coming out of a failed virtual reality business and supporting myself by being on the speaking circuit and writing books -- after twenty years or so in the computer game industry having ideas that people didn't think they could sell .PERIOD
And at the end of those remarkable conversations with kids and their best friends across the United States ,COMMA after two years ,COMMA we pulled together some survey data from another 10000 children ,COMMA drew up a set up of what we thought were the key findings of our research ,COMMA and spent another year transforming them into design heuristics ,COMMA for designing computer-based products -- and ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA any kind of products -- for little girls ,COMMA ages eight to 12 .PERIOD
And these voices will be accompanied by photographs that they took for us of their lives ,COMMA of the things that they value and care about .PERIOD
Girl 3 :COLON This is my pretend [unclear] one .PERIOD
This is the second day in Rockett's life .PERIOD

He went through Europe ,COMMA through World War II ,COMMA stealing ,COMMA extorting and occasionally buying various paintings for his collection .PERIOD
So he finally found an art dealer ,COMMA a Dutch art dealer named Han van Meegeren ,COMMA who sold him a wonderful Vermeer for the cost of what would now be 10 million dollars .PERIOD
He had a lesser charge of forgery ,COMMA got a year sentence and died a hero to the Dutch people .PERIOD
Many sociologists like Veblen and Wolfe would argue that the reason why we take origins so seriously is because we're snobs ,COMMA because we're focused on status .PERIOD
Would you eat this ?QUESTIONMARK
Few of you would eat it if it's a rat or a human .PERIOD
It's simple ,COMMA you tell them they're from McDonald's .PERIOD
It's very simple :COLON pour it from an expensive bottle .PERIOD
It will make a difference if they turn out to be much younger or much older than you think they are .PERIOD
That drops the value of it ,COMMA suggesting that that's one reason why we like it .PERIOD
Rather ,COMMA it's because I want something that has a specific history .PERIOD
Who here likes the work of Jackson Pollock ?QUESTIONMARK
And the Washington Post reporter Gene Weingarten decided to enlist him for an audacious experiment .PERIOD
So he got Joshua Bell to take his million dollar violin down to a Washington DC .PERIOD subway station and stand in the corner and see how much money he would make .PERIOD
He actually made 20 dollars more than that ,COMMA but he didn't count it .PERIOD
So she's stunned that he's standing in a subway station .PERIOD
One lovely experiment was done by Kurt Gray and Dan Wegner .PERIOD
And what I hope to show is that unpicking dodgy claims ,COMMA unpicking the evidence behind dodgy claims ,COMMA isn't a kind of nasty carping activity ;SEMICOLON it's socially useful ,COMMA but it's also an extremely valuable explanatory tool .PERIOD
She ,COMMA it turns out ,COMMA has a non-accredited correspondence course PhD .PERIOD
A glass of red wine a day could help prevent breast cancer .PERIOD
So I'm going to tell you about one trial ,COMMA which is probably the most well-reported trial in the UK .PERIOD news media over the past decade .PERIOD
And this has been demonstrated in a whole raft of fascinating studies comparing one kind of placebo against another .PERIOD
We know from three different studies on three different types of pain that a saltwater injection is a more effective treatment for pain than taking a sugar pill ,COMMA taking a dummy pill that has no medicine in it -- not because the injection or the pills do anything physically to the body ,COMMA but because an injection feels like a much more dramatic intervention .PERIOD
But that's not enough .PERIOD
What I find really fascinating is that the pharmaceutical industry uses exactly the same kinds of tricks and devices ,COMMA but slightly more sophisticated versions of them ,COMMA in order to distort the evidence that they give to doctors and patients ,COMMA and which we use to make vitally important decisions .PERIOD
And it's a foregone conclusion ,COMMA if you give a drug at that high a dose ,COMMA that it will have more side effects and that your new drug will look better .PERIOD
Everybody wanted to show that their drug was better than risperidone ,COMMA so you see a bunch of trials comparing new antipsychotic drugs against risperidone at eight milligrams a day .PERIOD
This is a drug called reboxetine .PERIOD
Around half of all of the trial data on antidepressants has been withheld ,COMMA but it goes way beyond that .PERIOD
But the companies withheld that data from them ,COMMA and so did the European Medicines Agency for three years .PERIOD
The infectious diseases Cochrane Group ,COMMA which are based in Italy ,COMMA has been trying to get the full data in a usable form out of the drug companies so that they can make a full decision about whether this drug is effective or not ,COMMA and they've not been able to get that information .PERIOD
This is undoubtedly the single biggest ethical problem facing medicine today .PERIOD
Thank you very much .PERIOD
I saw people struggling to get by ,COMMA not knowing what was what and what was next .PERIOD
You want a better life for yourself .PERIOD
There's this thing ,COMMA this militarization of the world ,COMMA and it's centered right in the United States .PERIOD
And the United States is responsible for almost one half of the world's military spending -- four percent of the world's population .PERIOD
And you feel it ;SEMICOLON you see it every day .PERIOD
You say ,COMMA How is that possible ?QUESTIONMARK
And their leaders ,COMMA their leaders :COLON before they send their sons and daughters off to war in your country -- and you know the reason -- before they send them off ,COMMA they go to a Christian church ,COMMA and they pray to their Christian God ,COMMA and they ask for protection and guidance from that god .PERIOD
Why ?QUESTIONMARK
They do wonderful things ,COMMA but they also do the bad things ,COMMA and you can't tell the difference .PERIOD
And this guy ,COMMA you get a guy like Lt .PERIOD Gen .PERIOD William Boykin .PERIOD
And you're thinking ,COMMA God ,COMMA if this guy is saying that ,COMMA then all the soldiers must be saying that .PERIOD
And this word here ,COMMA George Bush called this war a crusade .PERIOD
It's a holy war against Muslims .PERIOD
You feel frightened .PERIOD Of course you feel frightened .PERIOD
He wants to burn Korans ,COMMA our holy book .PERIOD
You don't know that .PERIOD
So here .PERIOD
And this is a perspective .PERIOD
So here's what I want you to do .PERIOD
I'm going out to defend your freedom ,COMMA your lives .PERIOD
And if I can get you to step into their shoes and walk an inch ,COMMA one tiny inch ,COMMA then imagine the kind of sociological analysis that you can do in all other aspects of your life .PERIOD

It was only in the second half of the 20 th century that we slowly began to pull ourselves out of this abyss .PERIOD

How many Ramanujans are there in India today toiling in the fields ,COMMA barely able to feed themselves ,COMMA when they could be feeding the world ?QUESTIONMARK
Twenty-first century could easily be 33 ,COMMA even higher percent .PERIOD
Even at that rate ,COMMA by 2100 average GDP per capita in the world will be $ 200000 .PERIOD
That's not that far .PERIOD

What about a great depression ?QUESTIONMARK
Now let's imagine that you were an economist in 1929 ,COMMA trying to forecast future growth for the United States ,COMMA not knowing that the economy was about to go off a cliff ,COMMA not knowing that we were about to enter the greatest economic disaster certainly in the 20 th century .PERIOD
In the last 30 years ,COMMA thanks to explorations in remote parts of the world and advances in technology ,COMMA biologists have ,COMMA for example ,COMMA added a full one-third of the known frog and other amphibian species ,COMMA to bring the current total to 5400 ,COMMA and more continue to pour in .PERIOD
Two new kinds of whales have been discovered ,COMMA along with two new antelopes ,COMMA dozens of monkey species and a new kind of elephant -- and even a distinct kind of gorilla .PERIOD
Consider the nematode roundworm ,COMMA the most abundant of all animals .PERIOD
But that number of bacteria species can be found in one gram of soil ,COMMA just a little handful of soil ,COMMA in the 10 billion bacteria that would be there .PERIOD
My own epiphany as a conservationist came in 1953 ,COMMA while a Harvard graduate student ,COMMA searching for rare ants found in the mountain forests of Cuba ,COMMA ants that shine in the sunlight -- metallic green or metallic blue ,COMMA according to species ,COMMA and one species ,COMMA I discovered ,COMMA metallic gold .PERIOD
And the final letter is O ,COMMA for over-harvesting -- driving species into extinction by excessive hunting and fishing .PERIOD
That's in the United States .PERIOD
But what excites me is that since I first put forward this particular idea in that form ,COMMA science has advanced .PERIOD
I wish you would help them .PERIOD
The encyclopedia will quickly pay for itself in practical applications .PERIOD
The idea that in that room at that moment ,COMMA everyone ,COMMA regardless of their age ,COMMA their gender ,COMMA their race ,COMMA their color ,COMMA their religion ,COMMA comes together .PERIOD
Let's start with technology .PERIOD
All right .PERIOD Let's start with theater .PERIOD
But the teachers came to me afterward and told me they hadn't seen the kids that attentive .PERIOD
Zero does not speak ,COMMA is neither man nor woman .PERIOD
And that usually ,COMMA if you're a bit extraordinary ,COMMA if you're not exactly of human appearance ,COMMA then people will feel inclined to participate and to feel out loud .PERIOD
I've worked as a doctor clown in a hospital for two years .PERIOD
It's a human and technological revolution .PERIOD
And well ,COMMA of course ,COMMA the Dutch can't eat all these pigs .PERIOD
And what I was curious about -- because historically ,COMMA the whole pig would be used up until the last bit so nothing would be wasted -- and I was curious to find out if this was actually still the case .PERIOD
And in cheesecake and all kinds of desserts ,COMMA like chocolate mousse ,COMMA tiramisu ,COMMA vanilla pudding ,COMMA everything that's cooled in the supermarket ,COMMA there's gelatin to make it look good .PERIOD
Fine bone china -- this is a real classic .PERIOD
I was not planning on showing you any meat because ,COMMA of course ,COMMA half the book's meat and you probably all know what meats they are .PERIOD
And the reason for this is that pigs are actually quite close to human beings ,COMMA so the collagen is as well .PERIOD
And they said ,COMMA Well the director of the company decided not to let you borrow this heart valve ,COMMA because want his product to be associated with pigs .PERIOD
Well it is ,COMMA because everything that can't be used for anything else is made into a fuel that can be used as renewable energy source .PERIOD
This is a picture of Maurice Druon ,COMMA the Honorary Perpetual Secretary of L'Academie francaise ,COMMA the French Academy .PERIOD
We see it in the constant appearance of slang and jargon ,COMMA of the historical change in languages ,COMMA in divergence of dialects and the formation of new languages .PERIOD
The problem is ,COMMA which verbs go in which constructions ?QUESTIONMARK
A transitive verb mandates that there has to be an object there :COLON Sam devoured the pizza .PERIOD You can't just say ,COMMA Sam devoured .PERIOD
There are dozens or scores of verbs of this type ,COMMA each of which shapes its sentence .PERIOD
First ,COMMA there's a level of fine-grained conceptual structure ,COMMA which we automatically and unconsciously compute every time we produce or utter a sentence ,COMMA that governs our use of language .PERIOD
Or ,COMMA The meeting went from three to four ,COMMA in which we conceive of time as stretched along a line .PERIOD
Or ,COMMA Rose forced herself to go ,COMMA as if there were two entities inside Rose's head ,COMMA engaged in a tug of a war .PERIOD
And I'll start out with a puzzle ,COMMA the puzzle of indirect speech acts .PERIOD
For example ,COMMA in brotherhoods ,COMMA fraternal organizations ,COMMA sororities ,COMMA locutions like the family of man ,COMMA you try to get people who are not related to use the relationship type that would ordinarily be appropriate to close kin .PERIOD
In that case ,COMMA the consequences are rather severe .PERIOD
On the other hand ,COMMA if you extend the bribe ,COMMA if the officer is dishonest ,COMMA you get a huge payoff of going free .PERIOD
The honest officer can't hold you to it as being a bribe ,COMMA and therefore ,COMMA you get the nuisance of the traffic ticket .PERIOD
Because I get to talk about one of my favorite critters ,COMMA which is the Western Grebe .PERIOD You haven't lived until you've seen these guys do their courtship dance .PERIOD
What they said to us at first was ,COMMA you know ,COMMA we already do biomimicry .PERIOD
And they said ,COMMA you know what happens is ,COMMA mineral -- just like at your house -- mineral builds up .PERIOD
So if we had some way to stop this scaling -- and so I picked up some shells on the beach .PERIOD And I asked them ,COMMA what is scaling ?QUESTIONMARK What's inside your pipes ?QUESTIONMARK
And they didn't know that .PERIOD
You know ,COMMA it's a silo ,COMMA people in silos .PERIOD They didn't know that the same thing was happening .PERIOD So one of them thought about it and said ,COMMA OK ,COMMA well ,COMMA if this is just crystallization that happens automatically out of seawater -- self-assembly -- then why aren't shells infinite in size ?QUESTIONMARK What stops the scaling ?QUESTIONMARK
How do we redesign the world that we make ,COMMA the human-made world ?QUESTIONMARK

That's the twelfth one .PERIOD
And I saw from a young age that having a decent job and earning a good living made the biggest difference for families who were struggling .PERIOD
I mean here was a girl who had never lived in peace time who somehow had come to sound like a candidate from The Apprentice .PERIOD
My first business was a dressmaking business I started under the Taliban .PERIOD
The IMF official is hardly the only person to automatically file women under micro .PERIOD
And in many places ,COMMA they're there .PERIOD
Because -- and I say this as somebody who worked in finance -- 500 billion dollars at least has gone into the emerging markets in the past decade .PERIOD
Just think of the benefits when it comes to jobs ,COMMA productivity ,COMMA employment ,COMMA child nutrition ,COMMA maternal mortality ,COMMA literacy and much ,COMMA much more .PERIOD
And not one country in all the world has eliminated its economic participation gap -- not one .PERIOD
The women in my family are not exceptions .PERIOD
The women in this room and watching in LA .PERIOD
Together we can make certain that the so-called exceptions begin to rule .PERIOD
Once upon a time in 19 th century Germany ,COMMA there was the book .PERIOD
Now during this time ,COMMA the book was the king of storytelling .PERIOD
His name was Lothar ,COMMA Lothar Meggendorfer .PERIOD
This man refused to fold to the conventions of normalcy and just decided to fold .PERIOD
Whether storytellers realized it or not ,COMMA they were channeling Meggendorfer's spirit when they moved opera to vaudville ,COMMA radio news to radio theater ,COMMA film to film in motion to film in sound ,COMMA color ,COMMA 3 D ,COMMA on VHS and on DVD .PERIOD
And I really want to build green ,COMMA but I'm very suspicious of all of these well-meaning articles ,COMMA people long on moral authority and short on data ,COMMA telling me how to do these kinds of things .PERIOD
Wipe it up ,COMMA throw it away .PERIOD
unless I use a front-loading ,COMMA high-efficiency washing machine ,COMMA and then it looks a little bit better .PERIOD
So what this says is that sometimes the things that you least expect -- the position in which you put the handle -- have a bigger effect than any of those other things that you were trying to optimize .PERIOD
We wanted to know how much better we could do .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA PVC is a little bit better ,COMMA but still not as good as the wood that we chose .PERIOD
When it comes time to sheetrock ,COMMA if you use EcoRock it's about a quarter of the embodied energy of standard sheetrock .PERIOD
If you put carpeting in your house ,COMMA it's about a tenth of the embodied energy of the entire house ,COMMA unless you use concrete or wood for a much lower embodied energy .PERIOD
So now we add in the final construction energy ,COMMA we add it all up ,COMMA and we've built a house for less than half of the typical embodied energy for building a house like this .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA I probably would have upgraded the old house to be more energy-efficient ,COMMA and in that case ,COMMA it would take me more about 20 years to break even .PERIOD
So what does this mean ?QUESTIONMARK
You might want to leave now .PERIOD
So I did .PERIOD
And I'm talking specifically about synanthropic species ,COMMA which are species that have adapted specifically for human ecologies ,COMMA species like rats and cockroaches and crows .PERIOD
So ,COMMA for example ,COMMA rats are incredibly responsive breeders .PERIOD
We're seeing a population boom with crows .PERIOD
And I'll give you an example of that .PERIOD
And these crows use sticks in the wild to get insects and whatnot out of pieces of wood .PERIOD
They messed up and left just a stick of wire in there .PERIOD
So what's significant about this isn't that crows are using cars to crack nuts .PERIOD
And as we heard yesterday ,COMMA that's the Pandora's box that's getting human beings in trouble ,COMMA and we're starting to see it with them .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA they're used to the sound of the machine ,COMMA and they keep coming back ,COMMA and digging out these peanuts from amongst the pile of coins that's there .PERIOD
The main thing ,COMMA the main point of all this for me is that we can find mutually beneficial systems for these species .PERIOD
So my grandfather told me when I was a little girl ,COMMA If you say a word often enough ,COMMA it becomes you .PERIOD
Anybody out here old enough to know Studs Terkel ,COMMA that old radio man ?QUESTIONMARK
The gradual slippage -- 'slippage' is the word used by the people in Watergate ,COMMA moral slippage -- it's a gradual kind of thing ,COMMA combination of things .PERIOD
Oh ,COMMA let me kind of tell you a funny little play bit .PERIOD
Just as a train is about to go ,COMMA a young couple rush in and they're just about to close the pneumatic doors .PERIOD
You see ,COMMA here's Huck ;SEMICOLON he's an illiterate kid ;SEMICOLON he's had no schooling ,COMMA but there's something in him .PERIOD
You know ,COMMA most actors want to do characters that are likeable -- well ,COMMA not always ,COMMA but the notion ,COMMA especially at a conference like this ,COMMA I like to inspire people .PERIOD
And I still feel as though I've got to get coffee for my male colleagues ,COMMA even though I've outlived most of them .PERIOD
Everything I do is word for word off a tape .PERIOD
And it didn't work ,COMMA didn't work .PERIOD
All around her head was just swollen ;SEMICOLON her head was about two sizes of its own size .PERIOD
He says ,COMMA 'She won't breathe' I knew immediately that she was dead .PERIOD
I didn't even want to accept the fact that she was dead ,COMMA so I went in and I put a mirror to her mouth -- there was no thing ,COMMA nothing ,COMMA coming out of her mouth .PERIOD
He said ,COMMA he said ,COMMA he said ,COMMA 'We can't ,COMMA we can't let nobody find out about this' He say ,COMMA 'You've got to help me' I agree .PERIOD I agree .PERIOD
And so I went to both -- two race riots ,COMMA one of which was the Los Angeles riot .PERIOD And this next piece is from that .PERIOD
And that trial came back with two cops going to jail and two cops declared innocent .PERIOD I was at that trial .PERIOD
So what she's questioning here ,COMMA she's taking a chance and questioning what justice is in society .PERIOD
We didn't qualify for medical treatment ,COMMA no food stamp ,COMMA no GR ,COMMA no welfare ,COMMA anything .PERIOD Many African-Americans who never work got minimum amount of money to survive .PERIOD
We didn't get any because we have a car and a house .PERIOD
And I wonder if that is really justice for them ,COMMA to get their rights in that way .PERIOD
But after the riot ,COMMA it's too much difference .PERIOD
The other reason that I don't wear shoes is just in case I really feel like I have to cuddle up and get into the feet of somebody ,COMMA walking really in somebody else's shoes .PERIOD
I was in a doctor's office last CAT scan ,COMMA and there was a Reader's Digest ,COMMA October 2002 .PERIOD
I mean ,COMMA like even when I told my wife that you want to come out here and talk to me ,COMMA she's like ,COMMA 'She's just talking ;SEMICOLON she's just being nice to you .PERIOD She's not going to do that' And then you called me up and you said you wanted to come out here and interview me and she went and looked you up on the Internet .PERIOD
She said ,COMMA 'Look who she is .PERIOD
Freedom ?QUESTIONMARK It would have to be the rodeo .PERIOD
I mean ,COMMA I guess it just be like -- I guess it be like the day my brother died .PERIOD
So check it ,COMMA I'm gonna to catch mockingbirds .PERIOD
I'll get some asshole at a watering hole asking what brand the ice is .PERIOD
I'll get the last time you lied .PERIOD
I'll get a lonely ,COMMA little sentence with real error in it ,COMMA Yeah ,COMMA I guess I could come inside ,COMMA but only for a minute .PERIOD
What does a violin have to do with technology ?QUESTIONMARK
The surface of the Earth is absolutely riddled with holes ,COMMA and here we are ,COMMA right in the middle .PERIOD
I'm on this 'til the whole thing spreads ,COMMA with chat rooms and copycats and moms maybe tucking kids into bed singing ,COMMA Hush ,COMMA little baby ,COMMA don't say a word .PERIOD
Wow .PERIOD
Now most media companies -- television ,COMMA radio ,COMMA publishing ,COMMA games ,COMMA you name it -- they use very rigid segmentation methods in order to understand their audiences .PERIOD
And so the bizarre result of this is that most of our popular culture is actually based on these presumptions about our demographics .PERIOD
Now there's something else that we've discovered about social media that's actually quite surprising .PERIOD
Well ,COMMA I actually don't think that's going to be the case .PERIOD
This is far too simplistic .PERIOD
So you may be asking ,COMMA well why is it important that I know what entertains people ?QUESTIONMARK
So imagine a media atmosphere that isn't dominated by lame stereotypes about gender and other demographic characteristics .PERIOD
Thank you so much .PERIOD
And she went to a neurologist who was fascinated .PERIOD
And the amazing thing to me is that now you would think this woman would like have excellent oral hygiene .PERIOD
I interviewed ,COMMA when I was working on the book ,COMMA I interviewed a woman who can think herself to orgasm .PERIOD
It was remarkable .PERIOD It took about one minute .PERIOD
And it is a fact that you can trigger spinal reflexes in dead people -- a certain kind of dead person ,COMMA a beating-heart cadaver .PERIOD
Obviously it wouldn't be as much fun for the person .PERIOD
You know ?QUESTIONMARK You can get cadavers if you work at a university .PERIOD
According to 1930 s marriage manual author ,COMMA Theodoor van de Velde ,COMMA a slight seminal odor can be detected on the breath of a woman within about an hour after sexual intercourse .PERIOD
But he wrote in this book ,COMMA Ideal Marriage -- he said that he could differentiate between the semen of a young man ,COMMA which he said had a fresh ,COMMA exhilarating smell ,COMMA and the semen of mature men ,COMMA whose semen smelled quote ,COMMA Remarkably like that of the flowers of the Spanish chestnut .PERIOD
And lo and behold ,COMMA the hiccups went away .PERIOD
It was called the upsuck theory .PERIOD
This is the 1950 s .PERIOD
I have an answer for you .PERIOD I have two answers .PERIOD
So now you have an evolutionary excuse .PERIOD
Alrighty .PERIOD There is considerable evidence for upsuck in the animal kingdom -- pigs ,COMMA for instance .PERIOD
And I also said to her ,COMMA Now these sows .PERIOD I mean ,COMMA you may have noticed there ,COMMA The sow doesn't look to be in the throes of ecstasy .PERIOD
This is the ejaculation face of the stump-tailed macaque .PERIOD
This is basically a penis camera on a motor .PERIOD
And in fact he found that in three quarters of the men the stuff just kind of slopped out .PERIOD
And that furthers the isolation that people like John found themselves in .PERIOD
But after having lost a beloved teacher in 2006 and a good friend last year to suicide ,COMMA and sitting last year at TEDActive ,COMMA I knew that I needed to step out of my silence and past my taboos to talk about an idea worth spreading -- and that is that people who have made the difficult choice to come back to life need more resources and need our help .PERIOD
This is the way that most of us were taught to tie our shoes .PERIOD
And here's how to tell .PERIOD
It will let you down less ,COMMA and not only that ,COMMA it looks better .PERIOD
Live long and prosper .PERIOD
It's called Tidying Up Art and it's ,COMMA as you can see ,COMMA it's more or less a picture book .PERIOD
I'd like to show them around so we can just ,COMMA you know -- Actually ,COMMA I managed to prepare for you some enlarged pictures -- even better .PERIOD
And we can see here very clearly ,COMMA it's a confusion of color .PERIOD
The various pictures here of the various elements of the picture -- the whole thing is unstructured .PERIOD
Yeah ,COMMA that's great .PERIOD
You can see now ,COMMA that's a good example :COLON even behaving in an orderly ,COMMA systematic way can sometimes lead to complete chaos .PERIOD
That's a picture by Keith Haring .PERIOD
In the end ,COMMA one has a list with which one then can arrange .PERIOD
Tidying up Rene Magritte -- this is really fun .PERIOD
Like books ,COMMA clothes ,COMMA toothbrush ,COMMA etc .PERIOD And it was great .PERIOD
But then one morning ,COMMA I hang the same little sign onto that picture by Vincent van Gogh .PERIOD
Here -- that's just my new proposal here for the Union Jack .PERIOD
yeah ,COMMA I think ,COMMA after you have seen that I have to leave anyway .PERIOD
One is hierarchical pores ,COMMA and the other is a macro-molecular nanoscale porosity in the material .PERIOD
Machines are becoming devastatingly capable of things like killing .PERIOD Right ?QUESTIONMARK
Those machines have no place for empathy .PERIOD
which was the basis of the movie Bladerunner .PERIOD
Even if you just try to get all of those ideas into your head by watching all those thousand TED videos ,COMMA it would actually currently take you over 250 hours to do so .PERIOD
Each of those TEDTalks has an average length of about 2300 words .PERIOD
Or Living in existential vacuum ;SEMICOLON it sucks .PERIOD
I mean .PERIOD
For example ,COMMA Dan Pink's talk on motivation ,COMMA which was pretty good if you haven't seen it :COLON Drop carrot .PERIOD Drop stick .PERIOD Bring meaning .PERIOD
Even then ,COMMA unfortunately ,COMMA it's not possible to summarize each TEDTalk individually .PERIOD
I don't know any TEDTalk that contains this .PERIOD
I had started out with a thousand TEDTalks and I had 600 six-word summaries for those .PERIOD
So I thought ,COMMA I probably have to take this one step further here and create summaries of the summaries -- and this is exactly what I did .PERIOD
So ,COMMA he's discovering the garden .PERIOD
His face ,COMMA by the way ,COMMA is fully AI-driven .PERIOD
Now we need to have a bit more engagement ,COMMA and again ,COMMA what we can do is we can look at the body .PERIOD
You stand up ,COMMA and you skim the stone .PERIOD
And we're going to help him with this now .PERIOD
But this is going to be an introduction ,COMMA and this is all about the deep psychology that we're trying to use .PERIOD
We're trying to introduce you to what I believe is the most wonderful part ,COMMA you being able to talk in your natural voice to Milo .PERIOD
He's just moved house .PERIOD He's got no friends .PERIOD
They're always getting stressed .PERIOD
Milo :COLON I just really miss my old house ,COMMA that's all .PERIOD
But for me ,COMMA this is a wonderful opportunity where technology ,COMMA at last ,COMMA can be connected with ,COMMA where I am no longer restrained by the finger I hold in my hand -- as far as a computer game's concerned -- or by the blandness of not being noticed if you're watching a film or a book .PERIOD
Each of you possesses the most powerful ,COMMA dangerous and subversive trait that natural selection has ever devised .PERIOD
I'm talking about your language ,COMMA of course ,COMMA because it allows you to implant a thought from your mind directly into someone else's mind ,COMMA and they can attempt to do the same to you ,COMMA without either of you having to perform surgery .PERIOD
And just imagine the sense of wonder in a baby when it first discovers that ,COMMA merely by uttering a sound ,COMMA it can get objects to move across a room as if by magic ,COMMA and maybe even into its mouth .PERIOD
And this cumulative cultural adaptation ,COMMA as anthropologists call this accumulation of ideas ,COMMA is responsible for everything around you in your bustling and teeming everyday lives .PERIOD
And this is also true of some remote oceanic islands .PERIOD
This remarkable image is not a map of the world .PERIOD
He thought ,COMMA Oh ,COMMA I can renovate the school .PERIOD
She found a job ,COMMA she scouted for jobs for her classmates and her friends .PERIOD
She not only changed her own dynamic ,COMMA she changed her household ,COMMA she changed her family ,COMMA her village .PERIOD
And that is that the central moral challenge of this century is gender inequity .PERIOD
So some of you may be thinking ,COMMA Gosh ,COMMA that's hyperbole .PERIOD
And ,COMMA you know ,COMMA it happens for several reasons .PERIOD
There are three reasons why this is the case .PERIOD
When you educate a girl ,COMMA she tends to have significantly fewer kids .PERIOD
It's kind of like the dirty ,COMMA little secret of poverty ,COMMA which is that ,COMMA not only do poor people take in very little income ,COMMA but also ,COMMA the income that they take in ,COMMA they don't spend it very wisely ,COMMA and unfortunately ,COMMA most of that spending is done by men .PERIOD
The last reason has to do with women being part of the solution ,COMMA not the problem .PERIOD
He was speaking to an audience much like yourselves .PERIOD
And that does not even include those that are trafficked within country borders ,COMMA which is a substantial portion .PERIOD
She fought off the hyenas with that stick .PERIOD
She's moved out of a vicious cycle and into a virtuous cycle .PERIOD
Let me tell you about Saima .PERIOD
And then ,COMMA when she had to transport all of the embroidery goods from the village to the marketplace ,COMMA she needed someone to help her do the transport ,COMMA so she hired her husband .PERIOD
A few yards away was a failed chicken coop .PERIOD
She never broke down .PERIOD
So ,COMMA here's the cause .PERIOD
Join the movement .PERIOD
You've all seen lots of articles on climate change ,COMMA and here's yet another New York Times article ,COMMA just like every other darn one you've seen .PERIOD
And we've accomplished close to zip .PERIOD
And there are times you might like to do something quick .PERIOD
Can you shade some sunlight and effectively compensate for the added CO 2 ,COMMA and produce a climate sort of back to what it was originally ?QUESTIONMARK
And the answer seems to be yes .PERIOD
It just sunk below the surface .PERIOD We weren't allowed to speak about it .PERIOD
And in fact ,COMMA he had some ideas to make them go away .PERIOD
But let's say you have sunlight hitting some particle and it's unevenly heated .PERIOD
So the side facing the sun is warmer ;SEMICOLON the side away ,COMMA cooler .PERIOD
And so you see a net force away from the sun .PERIOD
Because we have no way to agree about where to set the knobs .PERIOD
We need a broader debate .PERIOD
Let's say that we don't do geo-engineering ,COMMA we do what we ought to do ,COMMA which is get serious about cutting emissions .PERIOD
But I have a lot of reservations .PERIOD
And it's time to begin thinking about it ,COMMA even if the reason we're thinking about it is to construct arguments for why we shouldn't do it .PERIOD
And oddly ,COMMA the most notable letter of rejection I ever received came from Walt Disney World ,COMMA a seemingly innocuous site .PERIOD
And I wanted to see the center with my own eyes ,COMMA but what I came away with is a photograph .PERIOD
And it's just another place from which to observe ,COMMA and the understanding that there are no absolute ,COMMA all-knowing insiders .PERIOD
In this context I'll just show you a few .PERIOD
This is a cryopreservation unit ,COMMA and it holds the bodies of the wife and mother of cryonics pioneer Robert Ettinger ,COMMA who hoped to be awoken one day to extended life in good health ,COMMA with advancements in science and technology ,COMMA all for the cost of 35 thousand dollars ,COMMA for forever .PERIOD
And in this I really wanted it to resemble an early still-life painting ,COMMA so I spent some time with the smells and items .PERIOD
And the film was shot on 72 millimeter ,COMMA government-issue film .PERIOD
I investigate photography's ability to blur truth and fiction ,COMMA and its influence on memory ,COMMA which can lead to severe ,COMMA even lethal consequences .PERIOD
A victim or eyewitness identifies a suspected perpetrator through law enforcement's use of images .PERIOD
But through exposure to composite sketches ,COMMA Polaroids ,COMMA mug shots and line-ups ,COMMA eyewitness testimony can change .PERIOD
And he served 10 years of a life sentence .PERIOD
Ron Williamson .PERIOD Ron was convicted of the rape and murder of a barmaid at a club ,COMMA and served 11 years of a death sentence .PERIOD
Ronald Jones served eight years of a death sentence for rape and murder of a 28 -year-old woman .PERIOD
Some people say this is because we have better diagnosis ,COMMA and more people are being found out .PERIOD
For example ,COMMA these two show great growth in income ,COMMA absolutely flat happiness curves .PERIOD
My field ,COMMA the field of psychology ,COMMA hasn't done a whole lot to help us move forward in understanding human happiness .PERIOD
Emotions are short-lived intense responses to challenge and to opportunity .PERIOD
And each one of them allows us to click into alternate selves that tune in ,COMMA turn on ,COMMA drop out thoughts ,COMMA perceptions ,COMMA feelings and memories .PERIOD
We've come away from the Freudian gloom ,COMMA and people are now actively studying this .PERIOD
Absent from this list ,COMMA and absent from any discussions of happiness ,COMMA are happiness in another's happiness .PERIOD
Babies love the taste of sweet and hate the taste of bitter .PERIOD
Babies really are born with a lot of innate pleasures .PERIOD
It turned out that it wasn't ,COMMA that it really is a system of motivation ,COMMA a system of wanting .PERIOD
There is a profound need to belong .PERIOD
But there are ways in which our evolutionary history can really trip us up .PERIOD
So for example we have three systems that underlie reproduction ,COMMA because it's so important .PERIOD
There's attachment ,COMMA which is oxytocin ,COMMA and the opiates ,COMMA which says ,COMMA This is a long-term bond .PERIOD
So a person can be in a long term attachment ,COMMA become romantically infatuated with someone else ,COMMA and want to have sex with a third person .PERIOD
So if you look at questions like this ,COMMA life satisfaction ,COMMA you see life satisfaction going up with each rung of income .PERIOD
You see mental distress going up with lower income .PERIOD
But the effect is relatively small .PERIOD
And sure enough ,COMMA if you look at the kinds of values that come in ,COMMA you see wealth ,COMMA adventure ,COMMA achievement ,COMMA pleasure ,COMMA fun ,COMMA be respected ,COMMA before the change ,COMMA and much more post-materialist values after .PERIOD
I had all kinds of rats ,COMMA mice ,COMMA hamsters ,COMMA gerbils ,COMMA squirrels .PERIOD
Growing up in a multicultural environment ,COMMA we had African students in the house ,COMMA and I learned about their stories ,COMMA so different backgrounds ,COMMA dependency on imported know-how ,COMMA goods ,COMMA services ,COMMA exuberant cultural diversity .PERIOD
Princess Diana is announcing on TV that landmines form a structural barrier to any development ,COMMA which is really true .PERIOD
And actually ,COMMA our product -- what you see here .PERIOD
Rats have been used since the ' 50 s last century ,COMMA in all kinds of experiments .PERIOD
Rats have more genetic material allocated to olfaction than any other mammal species .PERIOD
So in our common language ,COMMA Dutch ,COMMA the name for TB .PERIOD
It gets a click sound and comes for the food reward .PERIOD
And by doing so ,COMMA very fast ,COMMA we can have like a second-line opinion to see which patients are positive ,COMMA which are negative .PERIOD
Just as an indication ,COMMA whereas a microscopist can process 40 samples in a day ,COMMA a rat can process the same amount of samples in seven minutes only .PERIOD
But let's stick first to tuberculosis .PERIOD
Throughout last year ,COMMA we've been -- depending on which intervals you take -- we've been consistently increasing case detection rates in five hospitals in Dar es Salaam between 30 and 40 percent .PERIOD
And there are simple things like ,COMMA for instance ,COMMA we have a small laser in the sniffer hole where the animal has to stick for five seconds .PERIOD
Also ,COMMA to standardize the pellets ,COMMA the food rewards ,COMMA and to semi-automate this in order to replicate this on a much larger scale and affect the lives of many more people .PERIOD
Here is a first prototype of our camera rat ,COMMA which is a rat with a rat backpack with a camera that can go under rubble to detect for victims after earthquake and so on .PERIOD
Thank you very much .PERIOD
So ,COMMA how do you go about studying the brain ?QUESTIONMARK
Now ,COMMA one recent discovery that has been made by researchers in Italy ,COMMA in Parma ,COMMA by Giacomo Rizzolatti and his colleagues ,COMMA is a group of neurons called mirror neurons ,COMMA which are on the front of the brain in the frontal lobes .PERIOD
So ,COMMA here is a neuron that fires when I reach and grab something ,COMMA but it also fires when I watch Joe reaching and grabbing something .PERIOD
It's almost as though it's performing a virtual reality simulation of the other person's action .PERIOD
For one thing they must be involved in things like imitation and emulation .PERIOD
So ,COMMA how do you do imitation ?QUESTIONMARK Why is imitation important ?QUESTIONMARK
And I claim that what happened was the sudden emergence of a sophisticated mirror neuron system ,COMMA which allowed you to emulate and imitate other people's actions .PERIOD
A human being ,COMMA a child ,COMMA can just watch its parent kill another polar bear ,COMMA and skin it and put the skin on its body ,COMMA fur on the body ,COMMA and learn it in one step .PERIOD What the polar bear took 100000 years to learn ,COMMA it can learn in five minutes ,COMMA maybe 10 minutes .PERIOD
It emerges from our understanding of basic neuroscience .PERIOD
For the longest time people have regarded science and humanities as being distinct .PERIOD
Pollen is a flower's way of making more flowers .PERIOD
Here is a scanning electron micrograph of a grain of pollen .PERIOD
The little hole in the middle ,COMMA we'll come to a bit later ,COMMA but that's for the pollen tube to come out later on .PERIOD A very tiny tube .PERIOD
So ,COMMA that's 20 micrometers across ,COMMA that pollen grain there .PERIOD
It's also very biologically active ,COMMA as anyone with hay fever will understand .PERIOD
And the reason for that is they've got to chuck out masses and masses of pollen to have any chance of the pollen reaching another plant of the same species .PERIOD
Again -- this time ,COMMA sycamore -- wind-dispersed .PERIOD
Cool pollen ,COMMA though .PERIOD
Remember ,COMMA that thing is just about 30 micrometers across .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA it's much more efficient if you can get insects to do your bidding .PERIOD
The pollen has little barbs on it ,COMMA if we look .PERIOD
That tells me that it's actually been fossilized ,COMMA this pollen .PERIOD
Isn't that cool ?QUESTIONMARK
And this is where it gets interesting for forensics .PERIOD
So ,COMMA not only does each type of pollen look different ,COMMA but each habitat has a different combination of plants .PERIOD
This is some pollen embedded in a cotton shirt ,COMMA similar to the one that I'm wearing now .PERIOD
And that is the 40 years that women have advocated .PERIOD
We have effective therapies now .PERIOD
Why are more and more women dying of ischemic heart disease ?QUESTIONMARK
So in the WISE ,COMMA 15 years ago ,COMMA we started out and said ,COMMA Well wow ,COMMA there's a couple of key observations and we should probably follow up on that .PERIOD
had recently published that when women have heart attacks and die ,COMMA compared to men who have heart attacks and die -- and again ,COMMA this is millions of people ,COMMA happening every day -- women ,COMMA in their fatty plaque -- and this is their coronary artery ,COMMA so the main blood supply going into the heart muscle -- women erode ,COMMA men explode .PERIOD
EKG goes pbbrrhh ,COMMA so the doctors can see this hugely abnormal EKG .PERIOD
So what do you think happens to these gals ?QUESTIONMARK
So unlike the CAT scans ,COMMA X-rays ,COMMA thalliums ,COMMA for women whose breast is in the way of looking at the heart ,COMMA every time we order something that has even a small amount of radiation ,COMMA we say ,COMMA Do we really need that test ?QUESTIONMARK
And those little red boxes are deaths .PERIOD
One of the things that we say about all of this female physiology -- because again ,COMMA as much as we're talking about women and heart disease ,COMMA women do ,COMMA on average ,COMMA have better longevity than men -- is that unfolding the secrets of female physiology and understanding that is going to help men and women .PERIOD
So we're 35 years behind .PERIOD
Women participate .PERIOD
Deb Roy :COLON This moment and thousands of other moments special for us were captured in our home because in every room in the house ,COMMA if you looked up ,COMMA you'd see a camera and a microphone ,COMMA and if you looked down ,COMMA you'd get this bird's-eye view of the room .PERIOD
This is my wife and I cooking breakfast in the kitchen ,COMMA and as we move through space and through time ,COMMA a very everyday pattern of life in the kitchen .PERIOD
In order to convert this opaque ,COMMA 90000 hours of video into something that we could start to see ,COMMA we use motion analysis to pull out ,COMMA as we move through space and through time ,COMMA what we call space-time worms .PERIOD
No video here ,COMMA so you can focus on the sound ,COMMA the acoustics ,COMMA of a new kind of trajectory :COLON gaga to water .PERIOD
This is one of the first results that came out of our study a little over a year ago that really surprised us .PERIOD
So it appears that all three primary caregivers -- myself ,COMMA my wife and our nanny -- were systematically and ,COMMA I would think ,COMMA subconsciously restructuring our language to meet him at the birth of a word and bring him gently into more complex language .PERIOD
What about the visual context ?QUESTIONMARK
And there's our nanny by the door .PERIOD
And what we've done is use the word water to tag that moment ,COMMA that bit of activity .PERIOD
Three of the key people in this project ,COMMA Philip DeCamp ,COMMA Rony Kubat and Brandon Roy are pictured here .PERIOD
Each of the links that you're seeing rendered here is an actual connection made between something someone said and a piece of content .PERIOD
We call this a co-viewing clique ,COMMA a virtual living room if you will .PERIOD
And there are fascinating dynamics at play .PERIOD
So this person is a key link in connecting mass media and social media together .PERIOD
Come here .PERIOD
Oh ,COMMA boy .PERIOD
And primary visual cortex sees just simple geometry ,COMMA just the simplest of shapes .PERIOD
And this is the part of the brain that will recognize what something is .PERIOD
You'd be activating the dorsal stream if you did that .PERIOD
And it's the part that feels .PERIOD
Now we've augmented this and spatialized this information .PERIOD
We make meaning by seeing ,COMMA by an act of visual interrogation .PERIOD
This is a time-lapse view of it .PERIOD
And this is an emerging set of technologies that use large-screen displays with intelligent calculation in the background to make the invisible visible .PERIOD
You can see the three-light transom there with the eyebrow windows -- certainly an architectural antique headed to the landfill .PERIOD
Even the lockset is probably worth 200 dollars .PERIOD
Then ,COMMA looking up in the turret ,COMMA you see there are bulges and pokes and sags and so forth .PERIOD
Then ,COMMA on the can it says ,COMMA This is the famous Budweiser beer ,COMMA we know of no other beer ,COMMA blah ,COMMA blah ,COMMA blah .PERIOD
This little house here ,COMMA those branches there are made out of Bois D'arc or Osage Orange ,COMMA and these pictures will keep scrolling as I talk a little bit .PERIOD
That's one of those new chocolate cell phones .PERIOD
It only rattles that expected pattern and unity of structural features .PERIOD
On the one hand ,COMMA we have an Apollonian perspective ,COMMA which is very crisp and premeditated and intellectualized and perfect .PERIOD
The Dionysian personality takes the picture and goes .PERIOD
Oops ,COMMA scratch ,COMMA dumpster .PERIOD
And here's a story :COLON Jim Tulles ,COMMA one of the guys I trained ,COMMA I said ,COMMA Jim ,COMMA it's time now .PERIOD
Jim ,COMMA now it's time .PERIOD You're the down ,COMMA oh .PERIOD
Good call ,COMMA Tulles .PERIOD From now on ,COMMA you guys hit this pile first .PERIOD
But once in a while you get access to the control room ,COMMA and then you can kind of mess with the dials .PERIOD
How disgusting .PERIOD
It's a pretty quick read .PERIOD
But as soon as you walk in ,COMMA I go ,COMMA Ooh .PERIOD Spaghetti sauce there .PERIOD
I feel that expectation ,COMMA and so I accommodate it ,COMMA and I'm living my life according to what you expect me to do .PERIOD
Wildebeests don't hang with lions because lions eat wildebeests .PERIOD
And so you see this in junior high a lot .PERIOD
On the bottom tier we have basic needs -- shelter ,COMMA clothing ,COMMA food ,COMMA water ,COMMA mating and so forth .PERIOD
We can't even afford to eat anything except beans .PERIOD
We're in trouble .PERIOD
And it raises an existential question ,COMMA which is ,COMMA if I'm having this experience of complete connection and full consciousness ,COMMA why am I not visible in the photograph ,COMMA and where is this time and place ?QUESTIONMARK
This is a police photo .PERIOD That's actually my car .PERIOD
I'm put on full life support ,COMMA and I have a massive stroke ,COMMA and my brain drops into a coma .PERIOD
And this is how we began .PERIOD
Now you also continue to watch as consciousness evolved to the point that here in India ,COMMA in Madhya Pradesh ,COMMA there's one of the two oldest known pieces of rock art found .PERIOD
While I was producing in Los Angeles ,COMMA I never thought about it for a second .PERIOD
Here's my brain .PERIOD
And this person is particularly interesting .PERIOD
The craniomandibular system is critical to that .PERIOD
If that sounds like a very ,COMMA very strange thing to say and rather a bold statement -- How can the jaw affect the entire body ?QUESTIONMARK -- let me simply point out to you ,COMMA if I ask you tomorrow to put one grain of sand between your teeth and go for a nice long walk ,COMMA how far would you last before you had to remove that grain of sand ?QUESTIONMARK
That tiny misalignment .PERIOD
Bear in mind ,COMMA there are no nerves in the teeth .PERIOD
That's why the same between the before and after that this shows ,COMMA it's hard to see the difference .PERIOD
This is an MRI MRA MRV ,COMMA a volumetric MRI .PERIOD
I've brought with me ,COMMA from Southern California ,COMMA the FM device .PERIOD
And when I came out of my coma ,COMMA I recognized my family ,COMMA but I didn't remember my own past .PERIOD
And I whispered the good news through my broken jaw ,COMMA which was wired shut ,COMMA to my night nurse .PERIOD
And during my time in coma ,COMMA she had been laid to rest in her hometown of Phoenix .PERIOD
You know ,COMMA when I heard Simon's -- please sit down ;SEMICOLON I just want to talk to him for a second -- when I read his book ,COMMA I went to LA to meet him .PERIOD
The thing that amazed me is the painstaking detail with which he has written every hospital he has been to ,COMMA every treatment he got ,COMMA every near-miss he had ,COMMA and how accidentally he stumbled upon innovations .PERIOD
Tell a little bit about what you're wearing on your leg .PERIOD
Because the chimpanzee would score half right if I gave them two bananas with Sri Lanka and Turkey .PERIOD They would be right half of the cases .PERIOD
I did also an unethical study of the professors of the Karolinska Institute -- that hands out the Nobel Prize in Medicine ,COMMA and they are on par with the chimpanzee there .PERIOD
Well ,COMMA I first discovered that the textbook was Tintin ,COMMA mainly .PERIOD
And what do you mean with Western world ?QUESTIONMARK I said .PERIOD
And 1962 ,COMMA there was really a group of countries here that was industrialized countries ,COMMA and they had small families and long lives .PERIOD
One dollar ,COMMA 10 dollars or 100 dollars per day .PERIOD
There's a little hump here .PERIOD But there are people all the way .PERIOD
We heard it in other forms .PERIOD And who are these ?QUESTIONMARK
Where are the different countries ?QUESTIONMARK I can show you Africa .PERIOD
The problem in the world was the poverty in Asia .PERIOD And if I now let the world move forward ,COMMA you will see that while population increase ,COMMA there are hundreds of millions in Asia getting out of poverty and some others getting into poverty ,COMMA and this is the pattern we have today .PERIOD
I can go here and I can split sub-Saharan Africa into its countries .PERIOD
And when it burst ,COMMA the size of its country bubble is the size of the population .PERIOD
Today ,COMMA we don't have to go to Cuba to find a healthy country in Latin America .PERIOD
The richest 20 percent of Ugandans are there .PERIOD
And we started to write software which could link the data like this .PERIOD
So I first went to Copenhagen because I thought ,COMMA well ,COMMA maybe I could become a biochemist ,COMMA but I discovered biochemistry was very boring .PERIOD
But Wilkins ,COMMA you know ,COMMA thought DNA was the best bet ,COMMA and he showed this x-ray photograph .PERIOD
And there I met Francis Crick .PERIOD
I went there without knowing him .PERIOD He was 35 .PERIOD I was 23 .PERIOD
And within a day ,COMMA we had decided that maybe we could take a shortcut to finding the structure of DNA .PERIOD
And the reason for doing so ,COMMA at the center of this photograph ,COMMA is Linus Pauling .PERIOD About six months before ,COMMA he proposed the alpha helical structure for proteins .PERIOD And in doing so ,COMMA he banished the man out on the right ,COMMA Sir Lawrence Bragg ,COMMA who was the Cavendish professor .PERIOD
This is a photograph several years later ,COMMA when Bragg had cause to smile .PERIOD
And they had the wisdom to say no .PERIOD So he didn't have it .PERIOD
But there was ones in the literature .PERIOD
So this was ,COMMA you know ,COMMA unexpected from the world's -- -- and so ,COMMA it was held together by hydrogen bonds between phosphate groups .PERIOD
And a month after we got the Pauling manuscript -- I should say I took the manuscript to London ,COMMA and showed the people .PERIOD
Well ,COMMA we got the answer on the 28 th February ' 53 .PERIOD
So I changed the locations ,COMMA and then we found the base pairing ,COMMA and Francis immediately said the chains run in absolute directions .PERIOD
So we saw how genetic information is carried .PERIOD
It didn't yield .PERIOD It didn't give good x-ray photographs .PERIOD
It was really ,COMMA you know ,COMMA sort of a shitty time .PERIOD
Well ,COMMA at that time -- I should go back .PERIOD
And then ,COMMA they learned how to read the letters for the code .PERIOD
There's a chip there ,COMMA a conventional one .PERIOD Then there's one made by a photolithography by a company in Madison called NimbleGen ,COMMA which is way ahead of Affymetrix .PERIOD
And we use their technique .PERIOD
Which is ,COMMA all of us have about 10 places in our genome where we've lost a gene or gained another one .PERIOD
Actually ,COMMA it's a really big idea .PERIOD
And they were going to spend the rest of their lives ,COMMA usually ,COMMA in this iron lung to breathe for them .PERIOD
And it happened so fast in the United States ,COMMA however ,COMMA that even just last month Jon Stewart said this :COLON Jon Stewart :COLON Where is polio still active ?QUESTIONMARK
They had come from thousands of miles away .PERIOD
It doesn't survive in the environment hardly at all .PERIOD
And we've got pretty good vaccines ,COMMA as I've just showed you .PERIOD
So those are the kind of stakes that we're after .PERIOD
So it was a massive effort .PERIOD
We've had to create one of the largest social movements in history .PERIOD
Now giving the polio vaccine is simple .PERIOD
Now it took years to build up the infrastructure for polio eradication -- more than 15 years ,COMMA much longer than it should have -- but once it was built ,COMMA the results were striking .PERIOD
Last year ,COMMA it was 1000 .PERIOD
We should abandon this idea of eradication .PERIOD
Let's settle for control -- that's good enough .PERIOD
Umar was paralyzed for life .PERIOD
As you probably can't see the detail here ,COMMA but this is his report card ,COMMA and you'll see ,COMMA he's got perfect scores .PERIOD
But you know I'd love to be able to tell you that Umar is a typical kid with polio these days ,COMMA but it's not true .PERIOD
The new vaccine had twice the impact on these last couple of viruses as the old vaccine had ,COMMA and we immediately started using this .PERIOD
Well ,COMMA in a couple of months we had to get it out of production .PERIOD
And we didn't start with the easy places .PERIOD
So this morning at about seven o'clock ,COMMA I decided that we'd try to drive Chris and the production crew here berserk by downloading all of our data from India again ,COMMA so that you could see something that's just unfolding today ,COMMA which proves that the impossible is possible .PERIOD
Today marks exactly six months -- and for the first time in history ,COMMA not a single child has been paralyzed in Uttar Pradesh or Bihar .PERIOD
We have the chance to write an entirely new polio-free chapter in human history .PERIOD
Beverly Joubert :COLON We are truly passionate about the African wilderness and protecting the African wilderness ,COMMA and so what we've done is we've focused on iconic cats .PERIOD
But one of the things that science really lets us down on is that personality ,COMMA that individual personality that these animals have .PERIOD
Well ,COMMA we needn't have worried .PERIOD
And we could only find this by pushing ourselves ,COMMA by going where no sane person should go -- not without some prompting ,COMMA by the way ,COMMA from Beverly -- and just pushing the envelope ,COMMA going out there ,COMMA pushing our vehicle ,COMMA pushing ourselves .PERIOD
We don't always get that right ,COMMA and on this particular day ,COMMA we seriously underestimated the depth .PERIOD
But that's ,COMMA I think ,COMMA what this is all about ,COMMA is that these individuals have these personalities and characters .PERIOD
Sleep deprivation is extreme .PERIOD
But ,COMMA for 10 years ,COMMA we tried to capture lions and elephants together -- and never ever managed until this particular night .PERIOD
This elephant ,COMMA against overwhelming odds ,COMMA simply gives up hope .PERIOD
But by the same token ,COMMA you can get your hope back again .PERIOD
Beverly sits on the one side where all her camera gear is ,COMMA and I'm on the other side where my space is .PERIOD
These are precious to us ,COMMA these divides .PERIOD
But when this little cub saw that I had vacated my seat and climbed to the back to get some camera gear ,COMMA she came in like a curious cat to come and investigate .PERIOD
And of course ,COMMA we knew now that she was going to survive .PERIOD
It was absolutely amazing when she picked it up to safety ,COMMA protecting it from the hyena .PERIOD
But I have to tell you -- everybody always asks ,COMMA What happened to the baby baboon ?QUESTIONMARK
We had to deal with these individual personalities .PERIOD
There's an immense amount of poaching as well ,COMMA and so possibly the same amount .PERIOD
Richard Feynman compared the accuracy of quantum theories -- experimental predictions -- to specifying the width of North America to within one hair's breadth of accuracy .PERIOD
And the familiar illustration is the nucleus of an atom is a fly in the middle of a sports stadium and the next atom is in the next sports stadium .PERIOD
As an evolutionary biologist ,COMMA I'd say this :COLON our brains have evolved to help us survive within the orders of magnitude of size and speed which our bodies operate at .PERIOD We never evolved to navigate in the world of atoms .PERIOD
Moving to the other end of the scale ,COMMA our ancestors never had to navigate through the cosmos at speeds close to the speed of light .PERIOD If they had ,COMMA our brains would be much better at understanding Einstein .PERIOD I want to give the name Middle World to the medium-scaled environment in which we've evolved the ability to take act -- nothing to do with Middle Earth .PERIOD
He stared at his wall in Arlington ,COMMA Virginia ,COMMA and decided to do it .PERIOD
Then ,COMMA General Stubblebine banged his nose hard on the wall of his office .PERIOD Stubblebine ,COMMA who commanded 16000 soldiers ,COMMA was confounded by his continual failure to walk through the wall .PERIOD
I have every reason to think it's true ;SEMICOLON I was reading Playboy because I ,COMMA myself ,COMMA had an article in it .PERIOD
And that's because in Middle World ,COMMA air friction is always there .PERIOD
We have this tendency to think that only solid ,COMMA material things are really things at all .PERIOD Waves of electromagnetic fluctuation in a vacuum seem unreal .PERIOD
Steve Grand points out that you and I are ,COMMA ourselves ,COMMA more like a wave than a permanent thing .PERIOD
After all ,COMMA you really were there at the time ,COMMA weren't you ?QUESTIONMARK
Not a single atom that is in your body today was there when that event took place .PERIOD Matter flows from place to place and momentarily comes together to be you .PERIOD
So really isn't a word that we should use with simple confidence .PERIOD
The fact that the bat uses echoes in pitch darkness to input the current variables to its model ,COMMA while the swallow uses light ,COMMA is incidental .PERIOD
Haldane guesses that a dog would probably be able to place the acids in the order of their molecular weights by their smells ,COMMA just as a man could place a number of piano wires in the order of their lengths by means of their notes .PERIOD
We're blind to all frequencies outside that ,COMMA unless we use instruments to help us .PERIOD
One way to think about that is by counting planets .PERIOD
In short ,COMMA when we're thinking like academics ,COMMA we regard people as elaborate and complicated machines ,COMMA like computers or cars ,COMMA but when we revert to being human we behave more like Basil Fawlty ,COMMA who ,COMMA we remember ,COMMA thrashed his car to teach it a lesson when it wouldn't start on gourmet night .PERIOD
Personification and the imputing of intentional purpose is such a brilliantly successful way to model humans ,COMMA it's hardly surprising the same modeling software often seizes control when we're trying to think about entities for which it's not appropriate ,COMMA like Basil Fawlty with his car or like millions of deluded people with the universe as a whole .PERIOD
And so this basically led me to a subject called cymatics .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA cymatics is the process of visualizing sound by basically vibrating a medium such as sand or water ,COMMA as you can see there .PERIOD
So ,COMMA what excites me about cymatics ?QUESTIONMARK
It's like a looking glass into a hidden world .PERIOD
We can also use cymatics for healing and education .PERIOD
This image here is created from a snippet of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony playing through a cymatic device .PERIOD
And we can evolve this exploration of the substance of things not seen .PERIOD Thank you .PERIOD
The war in Vietnam was raging ,COMMA the Civil Rights movement was under way and pictures had a powerful influence on me .PERIOD

Narrator :COLON A word about Galvao ,COMMA a very rare kind of bird native to Brazil .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA most of you have figured out that this was a prank ,COMMA and actually a very ,COMMA very good one .PERIOD
Because what happens on a social network is you interact with the people that you have chosen to interact with .PERIOD
And the reason it shouldn't be is that on any day you can go into Trending Topics .PERIOD
Now for me ,COMMA I'm surprised by this ,COMMA because this wasn't how the internet was supposed to be .PERIOD
We're heading to the future of bits ,COMMA where everything is speedy ,COMMA it's weightless .PERIOD
Here's what I think is going on .PERIOD
It includes things like the Internet cables .PERIOD
When we stop looking at the infrastructure that makes connection possible ,COMMA and we look at what actually happens ,COMMA we start realizing that the world doesn't work quite the same way that we think it does .PERIOD
That's down to about 12 to 15 percent .PERIOD
Even within Wikipedias ,COMMA where we're creating their own content online ,COMMA there's a heavy bias towards the place where a lot of the Wikipedia authors are based ,COMMA rather than to the rest of the world .PERIOD
You probably won't .PERIOD
This is a team of bloggers from around the world .PERIOD
But the more that I think about it ,COMMA the more that I think that a few things that we have learned along the way are interesting lessons for how we would rewire if we we wanted to use the web to have a wider world .PERIOD
In this case -- the map of the world at night by NASA -- they're dark literally because of lack of electricity .PERIOD
I'm also guessing that most of you don't even speak Chinese -- which is sort of sad if you think about it ,COMMA as it's now the most represented language on the internet .PERIOD
They put it online for free .PERIOD
My guess is at least one of them has something interesting to say .PERIOD
And search is terrific if you know what you're looking for .PERIOD
She has to know something about what stories are available .PERIOD
I know Amira .PERIOD
He knows one world ,COMMA and he's finding a way to communicate it to another world ,COMMA both of which he has deep connections to .PERIOD
And the house that John Wilkes Booth planned the assassination of Abraham Lincoln is actually also now a Chinese restaurant called Wok 'n Roll ,COMMA on H Street in Washington .PERIOD
The short answer is ,COMMA actually ,COMMA they're from Japan .PERIOD
The original name in my book was actually called The Long March of General Tso ,COMMA and he has marched very far indeed ,COMMA because he is sweet ,COMMA he is fried ,COMMA and he is chicken -- all things that Americans love .PERIOD
He's retired ,COMMA deaf and plays a lot of Mahjong .PERIOD
But in China ,COMMA this guy's actually known for war and not chicken .PERIOD
I like to say chop suey's the biggest culinary joke that one culture has ever played on another ,COMMA because chop suey ,COMMA if you translate into Chinese ,COMMA means tsap sui ,COMMA which ,COMMA if you translate back ,COMMA means odds and ends .PERIOD
Now back then ,COMMA the Americans were not clamoring to eat Chinese food .PERIOD
There is West Indian Chinese food ,COMMA there's Jamaican Chinese food ,COMMA there is Middle Eastern Chinese food ,COMMA there's Mauritian Chinese food .PERIOD
This is a dish called Magic Bowl that I discovered .PERIOD
They actually did so through a centralized headquarters out of Illinois ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK
It wasn't that ,COMMA so they're like ,COMMA OK ,COMMA let's look at television ,COMMA so they looked at an episode of Lost .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA I don't have a TV ,COMMA which makes me a freak ,COMMA but very productive ,COMMA and -- -- and this episode of Lost ,COMMA I understand ,COMMA where the overweight guy has a lucky number which was not a lucky number ,COMMA which was how long they'd been on the island ,COMMA but they looked ,COMMA and the numbers did not match .PERIOD
This actually is a slip that one of the winners had ,COMMA because the Tennessee lottery security officials were like ,COMMA oh ,COMMA no -- like ,COMMA this can't be true .PERIOD
Yeah .PERIOD So ,COMMA I went and started looking .PERIOD
It was lunch ,COMMA it was take-out ,COMMA it was sit-down ,COMMA it was buffet ,COMMA it was three weeks ago ,COMMA it was three months ago .PERIOD
This time ,COMMA I'm going to talk about mental illness .PERIOD
Not only would it lift ,COMMA but it might never return .PERIOD
That always makes hair stand up and people shake a lot .PERIOD
So ,COMMA they went to the police and they said ,COMMA We know that at the Rome railroad station ,COMMA there are all these lost souls wandering around ,COMMA muttering gibberish .PERIOD Can you bring one of them to us ?QUESTIONMARK
That's not going to do anything terrible to him .PERIOD
Well ,COMMA you know ,COMMA in the middle ' 60 s ,COMMA the first antidepressants came out .PERIOD Tofranil was the first .PERIOD
Finally ,COMMA I would schedule -- all my major surgical cases ,COMMA I was scheduling them for 12 ,COMMA one o'clock in the afternoon ,COMMA because I couldn't get out of bed before about 11 o'clock .PERIOD
And my colleagues ,COMMA who had known me since medical school in that place ,COMMA said ,COMMA Don't worry ,COMMA chap .PERIOD Six weeks ,COMMA you're back in the operating room .PERIOD Everything's going to be great .PERIOD
You've seen this painting by Edvard Munch ,COMMA The Scream .PERIOD Every moment was a scream .PERIOD
Well ,COMMA as in all hospitals ,COMMA there was a resident assigned to my case .PERIOD He was 27 years old ,COMMA and he would meet with me two or three times a week .PERIOD
Any of the results along the spectrum ,COMMA from pretty bad to terrible ,COMMA terrible ,COMMA terrible is going to happen .PERIOD If he does the best he can ,COMMA he will have no further obsessions ,COMMA probably no depression ,COMMA but his affect will be dulled ,COMMA he will never go back to surgery ,COMMA he will never be the loving father that he was to his two children ,COMMA his life will be changed .PERIOD If he has the usual result ,COMMA he will end up like 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' And you know about that ,COMMA just essentially in a stupor the rest of his life .PERIOD
Plugged me into the wires ,COMMA put me to sleep ,COMMA gave me the muscle relaxant .PERIOD
But ,COMMA lo and behold ,COMMA by 16 ,COMMA by 17 ,COMMA there were demonstrable differences in the way I felt .PERIOD
It was as though those tightly coiled wires in my head had been disconnected and I could think clearly .PERIOD
My children came back to live with us .PERIOD
We had two more children after that .PERIOD
It's been ,COMMA as I said ,COMMA close to 30 years .PERIOD
Every once in a while ,COMMA I get somewhat depressed and a little obsessional .PERIOD
And I've always felt guilty about that .PERIOD
I hope it happens to none of you ,COMMA but it will probably happen to a small percentage of you .PERIOD
Would you describe that as global citizenship ?QUESTIONMARK
I believe the concept of global citizenship will simply grow out of people talking to each other across continents .PERIOD
But people get excited about this idea of global citizenship ,COMMA but then they get confused a bit again when they start thinking about patriotism ,COMMA and how to combine these two .PERIOD
When you actually look at the motor of the world economy ,COMMA it cannot move forward unless there is trade between the different countries .PERIOD
Well I think we can persuade people that what is necessary for Britain's long-term interests ,COMMA what is necessary for America's long-term interests ,COMMA is proper engagement with the rest of the world ,COMMA and taking the action that is necessary .PERIOD
And we have got to realize that if we don't link up with those people who are sensible voices and democratic voices in Africa ,COMMA to work together for common causes ,COMMA then the danger of Al Qaeda and related groups making progress in Africa is very big .PERIOD
And I wouldn't like anything that is said today to suggest that I am diminishing the importance of the responsibility that each individual leader has for their own country .PERIOD
Where was the early warning systems ?QUESTIONMARK
All these things have happened .PERIOD
Even if ,COMMA as a human being ,COMMA you believe that ,COMMA you can't say that .PERIOD You're elected for Britain's interests .PERIOD
Since then ,COMMA the world has moved forward ,COMMA partly as a result of what happened with the Holocaust ,COMMA and people's concern about the rights of individuals within territories where they need protection ,COMMA partly because of what we saw in Rwanda ,COMMA partly because of what we saw in Bosnia .PERIOD
The idea of the responsibility to protect all individuals who are in situations where they are at humanitarian risk is now being established as a principle which governs the world .PERIOD
So ,COMMA while I can't automatically say that Britain will rush to the aid of any citizen of any country ,COMMA in danger ,COMMA I can say that Britain is in a position where we're working with other countries so that this idea that you have a responsibility to protect people who are victims of either genocide or humanitarian attack ,COMMA is something that is accepted by the whole world .PERIOD
Yes .PERIOD And then of course the theory is still that those talks get rent apart by different countries fighting over their own individual interests .PERIOD
America has made its first disposition on this with the bill that President Obama should be congratulated for getting through Congress .PERIOD
And God shook his head and said ,COMMA Not this year ,COMMA not this decade ,COMMA perhaps not even in your lifetime .PERIOD
And Bill Clinton walked away in tears because he had failed to get what he wanted .PERIOD
So that's kind of a bold statement .PERIOD
And it's technological ,COMMA so it can do things like microelectronics ,COMMA and maybe photonics do .PERIOD
And the material looks something like this .PERIOD
The process of discovery ,COMMA generally ,COMMA is inspired by nature .PERIOD
They find their way to self-assemble .PERIOD
And we can store information that's film with water and protein .PERIOD
You can imagine that then maybe you can use a pure protein to guide light ,COMMA and so we've made optical fibers .PERIOD
You can do electronic pieces that fold and wrap .PERIOD
You can implant it in the body without needing to retrieve what is implanted .PERIOD
And you see there ,COMMA it gets reintegrated in tissue .PERIOD
So you have a clock ,COMMA you have protein ,COMMA and now a silk cup like this can be thrown away without guilt -- unlike the polystyrene cups that unfortunately fill our landfills everyday .PERIOD
So it allows for the recovery of what we've stored before .PERIOD
Some people in the last decade or two have started creating artwork with technology .PERIOD
You can learn something from the robot about the community that you're in .PERIOD
You guys are looking good out there .PERIOD
Data :COLON Here's the first one .PERIOD
One of them falls to the ground .PERIOD

You've been a great audience .PERIOD
There's a lot more to come .PERIOD
Then he said ,COMMA But really ,COMMA Sarah ,COMMA you could have worked harder !EXCLAMATIONMARK Can't you see it's really too small ?QUESTIONMARK
Indeed ,COMMA it's rather small .PERIOD
One day ,COMMA while my father was working on a file for us to obtain French nationality ,COMMA I happened to see some documents that caught my attention .PERIOD
These are real !EXCLAMATIONMARK
So ,COMMA his story .PERIOD My father was born in Argentina .PERIOD
This coincided with the time when he threw himself body and soul into chemistry because it was the only consolation for his sadness .PERIOD
It was my grandfather who decided they needed false documents .PERIOD
But it was he who went to meet a man from the Resistance .PERIOD
In those times documents had hard covers ,COMMA they were filled in by hand ,COMMA and they stated your job .PERIOD
He started inventing all kind of things -- with some materials he invented a centrifuge using a bicycle wheel .PERIOD
Time passed ,COMMA and they thought he had surely forgotten them ,COMMA at first .PERIOD
And then I understood that asking my father so many questions was stirring up a whole past he probably didn't feel like talking about because it was painful .PERIOD
In Africa there were countries fighting for their independence :COLON Guinea ,COMMA Guinea-Bissau ,COMMA Angola .PERIOD
There was also Latin America .PERIOD
He said no .PERIOD
We live on a human-dominated planet ,COMMA putting unprecedented pressure on the systems on Earth .PERIOD
This is a scientific journey on the challenges facing humanity in the global phase of sustainability .PERIOD
So I thought I'd bring her with me today on stage ,COMMA to have her as a witness of a remarkable journey ,COMMA which humbly reminds us of the period of grace we've had over the past 10000 years .PERIOD
Here ,COMMA used as a proxy ,COMMA temperature variability .PERIOD
It was a jumpy ride .PERIOD 80000 years back in a crisis ,COMMA we leave Africa ,COMMA we colonize Australia in another crisis ,COMMA 60000 years back ,COMMA we leave Asia for Europe in another crisis ,COMMA 40000 years back ,COMMA and then we enter the remarkably stable Holocene phase ,COMMA the only period in the whole history of the planet ,COMMA that we know of ,COMMA that can support human development .PERIOD
The majority of the planet ,COMMA aspiring for development ,COMMA having the right for development ,COMMA are in large aspiring for an unsustainable lifestyle ,COMMA a momentous pressure .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA you would have wished the climate pressure to hit a strong planet ,COMMA a resilient planet ,COMMA but unfortunately ,COMMA the third pressure is the ecosystem decline .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA if we have evidence ,COMMA which we now have ,COMMA that wetlands ,COMMA forests ,COMMA [unclear] monsoon system ,COMMA the rainforests ,COMMA behave in this nonlinear way .PERIOD
And could we even ,COMMA thanks to major advancements in Earth systems science ,COMMA identify the thresholds ,COMMA the points where we may expect nonlinear change ?QUESTIONMARK
Now this is the Big Bang equivalent then of human development within the safe operating space of the planetary boundaries .PERIOD
In the ' 60 s already ,COMMA through the green revolution and the Haber-Bosch process of fixing nitrogen from the atmosphere -- you know ,COMMA human's today take out more nitrogen from the atmosphere than the whole biosphere does naturally as a whole .PERIOD
There's good news here ,COMMA for example ,COMMA from Latin America ,COMMA where plow-based farming systems of the ' 50 s and ' 60 s led farming basically to a dead-end ,COMMA with lower and lower yields ,COMMA degrading the organic matter and fundamental problems at the livelihood levels in Paraguay ,COMMA Uruguay and a number of countries ,COMMA Brazil ,COMMA leading to innovation and entrepreneurship among farmers in partnership with scientists into an agricultural revolution of zero tillage systems combined with mulch farming with locally adapted technologies ,COMMA which today ,COMMA for example ,COMMA in some countries ,COMMA have led to a tremendous increase in area under mulch ,COMMA zero till farming which ,COMMA not only produces more food ,COMMA but also sequesters carbon .PERIOD
It has to basically do this on current land .PERIOD
Elinor Ostrom ,COMMA the latest Nobel laureate of economics ,COMMA clearly shows empirically across the world that we can govern the commons if we invest in trust ,COMMA local ,COMMA action-based partnerships and cross-scale institutional innovations ,COMMA where local actors ,COMMA together ,COMMA can deal with the global commons at a large scale .PERIOD
where you give the guaranteed price for investment in renewable energy ,COMMA but you can subsidize electricity to poor people .PERIOD
So ,COMMA there is scientific evidence .PERIOD
I was asked to come here and speak about creation .PERIOD
You know ,COMMA creation is what put that dog in that picture ,COMMA and creativity is what makes us see a chicken on his hindquarters .PERIOD
And another point -- why I'm here -- is that the day I went to pick up the Plexiglas trophy ,COMMA I rented a tuxedo for the first time in my life ,COMMA picked the thing -- didn't have any friends .PERIOD
Somebody was hitting somebody else with brass knuckles .PERIOD
And that's how -- with this money I paid for a ticket to come to the United States in 1983 ,COMMA and that's very -- the basic reason I'm talking to you here today :COLON because I got shot .PERIOD
Unfortunately ,COMMA it has become obsolete because it was designed for Atari platform .PERIOD
But I was still ,COMMA you know -- this is a kitty cloud .PERIOD
The Snail .PERIOD
And your eye doesn't know which level to read .PERIOD
And they would look at it -- Ah ,COMMA it's a pencil drawing .PERIOD
It had a physicality ,COMMA and you start going deeper and deeper into sort of narrative that goes this way ,COMMA towards the image .PERIOD So this is Monkey with Leica .PERIOD
And I wanted to deal with other subjects .PERIOD
I got some photographs from them .PERIOD
And Jackson Pollock also .PERIOD
I used the dust at the Whitney Museum to render some pieces of their collection .PERIOD
And I picked minimalist pieces because they're about specificity .PERIOD
They do a DNA scan of this ,COMMA they will come up with a great mailing list .PERIOD
Also ,COMMA the reference to Gerhard Richter's use of color charts -- and the idea also entering another realm of representation that's very common to us today ,COMMA which is the bit map .PERIOD
I opt for very simple line drawings -- kind of stupid looking .PERIOD
On the other hand ,COMMA you know ,COMMA I paid like three dollars ,COMMA I think -- and I went to a warehouse in Queens to see a version of Othello by an amateur group .PERIOD
That's why we pay to go to magic shows and things like that .PERIOD
And the information is there twice -- one on each strand -- which is important ,COMMA because when new cells are formed ,COMMA these strands come apart ,COMMA new strands are synthesized with the old ones as templates in an almost perfect process .PERIOD
So an interesting question is ,COMMA what happened when we met ?QUESTIONMARK
So this involves a lot of technical issues in how you extract the DNA ,COMMA how you convert it to a form you can sequence .PERIOD
The same is true if we look at a Chinese individual versus an African ,COMMA the Neanderthal will match the Chinese individual more often .PERIOD
And further back ,COMMA 800000 years ago is there a common origin with present day humans .PERIOD
But we do find it in Papua New Guinea and in other islands in Melanesia and the Pacific .PERIOD
We don't know quite where the borders between these people were ,COMMA but we know that in Southern Siberia ,COMMA there were both Neanderthals and Denisovans at least at some time in the past .PERIOD
And since we mixed elsewhere ,COMMA I'm pretty sure that one day ,COMMA when we will perhaps have a genome of also these earlier forms in Africa ,COMMA we will find that they have also mixed with early modern humans in Africa .PERIOD
And if I were to write a volume ,COMMA it would be called ,COMMA Artists Who Have Led My Exhibitions because my work ,COMMA in understanding art and in understanding culture ,COMMA has come by following artists ,COMMA by looking at what artists mean and what they do and who they are .PERIOD
My overall project is about art -- specifically ,COMMA about black artists -- very generally about the way in which art can change the way we think about culture and ourselves .PERIOD
What that might mean for cultural movements all over this moment ,COMMA the me ,COMMA we seems incredibly prescient totally important .PERIOD
To this end ,COMMA the specific project that has made this possible for me is a series of exhibitions ,COMMA all titled with an F -- Freestyle ,COMMA Frequency and Flow -- which have set out to discover and define the young ,COMMA black artists working in this moment who I feel strongly will continue to work over the next many years .PERIOD
It is really in this sense of discovery that I have a new set of questions that I'm asking .PERIOD
But ,COMMA really ,COMMA it has been what I've discovered about myself and what I can offer in the space of an exhibition ,COMMA to talk about beauty ,COMMA to talk about power ,COMMA to talk about ourselves ,COMMA and to talk and speak to each other .PERIOD
And you put on the T- 10 parachute .PERIOD
They give 20 minutes -- that's a time warning .PERIOD
And that's to boost everybody's confidence ,COMMA to show that you're not scared .PERIOD
Then they give you ,COMMA Get ready .PERIOD
So nice air comes flowing in .PERIOD
So then you look around ,COMMA you're under a canopy and you say ,COMMA This is good .PERIOD
In 30 -some years of jumping ,COMMA I never did one .PERIOD
And I realized that ,COMMA if they had to go into combat ,COMMA they would do what we had taught them and they would follow leaders .PERIOD
So now I do that Tuesday morning jump ,COMMA but it's not any jump -- that was September 11 th ,COMMA 2001 .PERIOD
Sort of leadership by humiliation .PERIOD
I've got to use video teleconferences ,COMMA I've got to use chat ,COMMA I've got to use email ,COMMA I've got to use phone calls -- I've got to use everything I can ,COMMA not just for communication ,COMMA but for leadership .PERIOD
And that's a new kind of leadership for me .PERIOD
So we had to get complex intelligence together ,COMMA we had to line up the ability to act .PERIOD
In reality ,COMMA much of the force I led looked exactly like you .PERIOD
And so instead of giving orders ,COMMA you're now building consensus and you're building a sense of shared purpose .PERIOD
It also produced something which I call an inversion of expertise ,COMMA because we had so many changes at the lower levels in technology and tactics and whatnot ,COMMA that suddenly the things that we grew up doing wasn't what the force was doing anymore .PERIOD
And it's a brand new leadership challenge .PERIOD
And every morning in the Ranger regiment ,COMMA every Ranger -- and there are more than 2000 of them -- says a six-stanza Ranger creed .PERIOD
And so the organizational relationship that bonds them is just amazing .PERIOD
That was my journey .PERIOD
I came to believe that a leader isn't good because they're right ;SEMICOLON they're good because they're willing to learn and to trust .PERIOD
Alex Steffen and I founded Worldchanging in late 2003 ,COMMA and since then we and our growing global team of contributors have documented the ever-expanding variety of solutions that are out there ,COMMA right now and on the near horizon .PERIOD
As Norwegian social scientist Evelin Lindner has observed ,COMMA Pessimism is a luxury of good times .PERIOD
In difficult times ,COMMA pessimism is a self-fulfilling ,COMMA self-inflicted death sentence .PERIOD
Community tools ,COMMA like text messaging ,COMMA that can tell you when pollen counts are up or smog levels are rising or a natural disaster is unfolding ,COMMA can give you the information you need to act in a timely fashion .PERIOD
The political aspects of mobile phones can't be ignored either ,COMMA from text message swarms in Korea helping to bring down a government ,COMMA to the Blairwatch Project in the UK ,COMMA keeping tabs on politicians who try to avoid the press .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA imagine a similar model for networking environmentalists .PERIOD
Imagine a Web portal collecting recordings and evidence of what's happening to the planet :COLON putting news and data at the fingertips of people of all kinds ,COMMA from activists and researchers to businesspeople and political figures .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA just to be clear ,COMMA in this talk I'm using the name Earth Witness as part of the scenario ,COMMA simply as a shorthand ,COMMA for what this imaginary project could aspire to ,COMMA not to piggyback on the wonderful work of the Witness organization .PERIOD
Earth Witness would show us two worlds :COLON the world we're leaving behind ,COMMA and the world we're building for generations to come .PERIOD
After this ,COMMA we noticed a couple of interesting things ,COMMA which you'll see .PERIOD
Make yourself understood to the computer .PERIOD
And he couldn't travel ,COMMA so I went over there .PERIOD
And all over India ,COMMA at the end of about two years ,COMMA children were beginning to Google their homework .PERIOD
They said ,COMMA Yes ,COMMA we did .PERIOD
So I said ,COMMA For two months ,COMMA you were looking at stuff you didn't understand ?QUESTIONMARK
It took me three years to publish that .PERIOD
I said ,COMMA No ,COMMA use the method of the grandmother .PERIOD
What is that ?QUESTIONMARK Can you do that again ?QUESTIONMARK Can you show me some more' She did that for two months .PERIOD
The scores went up to 50 ,COMMA which is what the posh schools of New Delhi ,COMMA with a trained biotechnology teacher were getting .PERIOD
The first group -- the best one -- solved everything in 20 minutes .PERIOD
The average score when I'd done it with the computers and the groups was 76 percent .PERIOD
Back at Gateshead ,COMMA a 10 -year-old girl gets into the heart of Hinduism in 15 minutes .PERIOD
You know ,COMMA stuff which I don't know anything about .PERIOD
This is a SOLE in Newcastle .PERIOD
I started writing English questions on the blackboard .PERIOD
So you know what's happened ?QUESTIONMARK
Thanks .PERIOD
I was too young ,COMMA unmarried ,COMMA I had no children ,COMMA didn't really know Africa ,COMMA and besides ,COMMA my French was pitiful .PERIOD
So then I went the whole American way ,COMMA with competitions ,COMMA team and individual .PERIOD Completely failed ,COMMA but over time ,COMMA the women learnt to sell on their own way .PERIOD
So ,COMMA blue ,COMMA blue ,COMMA everything became blue .PERIOD
I think Andrew pretty well covered that ,COMMA so I will move to the third point ,COMMA which is that markets alone also are not going to solve the problems of poverty .PERIOD
Both of them live at the confluence of public health and enterprise ,COMMA and both of them ,COMMA because they're manufacturers ,COMMA create jobs directly ,COMMA and create incomes indirectly ,COMMA because they're in the malaria sector ,COMMA and Africa loses about 13 billion dollars a year because of malaria .PERIOD
And it's really time we start thinking more creatively about how they can be fused .PERIOD
He was actually living in the Kibera slums when his father called him and told him about Artemisia and the value-add potential .PERIOD
Samuel's kids are in private school ,COMMA and he's starting to help other farmers in the area also go into Artemisia production -- dignity being more important than wealth .PERIOD
The next one ,COMMA many of you know .PERIOD
And so ,COMMA from an enterprise perspective for Africa ,COMMA and from a public health perspective ,COMMA these are real successes .PERIOD
We can start building local distribution ,COMMA and actually ,COMMA it can cost the public sector much less .PERIOD
One ,COMMA that people will pay different prices ,COMMA but the overwhelming number of people will come forth at one dollar per net and make a decision to buy it .PERIOD
But what it takes is a commitment from all of us to essentially refuse trite assumptions ,COMMA get out of our ideological boxes .PERIOD
And we came up with some parameters ,COMMA because ,COMMA you know ,COMMA building a Rube Goldberg machine has limitations ,COMMA but it also is pretty wide open .PERIOD
Okay ,COMMA so now the start to finish timing has to be perfect .PERIOD
Of those 85 takes ,COMMA only three actually successfully completed their run .PERIOD
And the wonderful elation that we had when we finally completed it .PERIOD
It think we can do better than this .PERIOD Hello TEDxUSC .PERIOD
Let me start again .PERIOD
Where it goes in the future is questioned .PERIOD So that's the human part .PERIOD
And in that 15 percent ,COMMA the main focus is on human mind ,COMMA thinking skills ,COMMA somehow trying to unleash kids from the straightjacket of school ,COMMA which is putting information and dogma into them ,COMMA get them so they really think ,COMMA ask tough questions ,COMMA argue about serious subjects ,COMMA don't believe everything that's in the book ,COMMA think broadly or creative .PERIOD They can be .PERIOD
Here's a giant flying replica of a pterosaur that has no tail .PERIOD
This was the full size of the original creature .PERIOD
It sends high-resolution video pictures back to the operator .PERIOD
Buckminster Fuller said it clearly :COLON there are no passengers on spaceship Earth ,COMMA only crew .PERIOD We ,COMMA the crew ,COMMA can and must do more with less -- much less .PERIOD
It's amazing :COLON just on the puny power of the sun -- by having a super lightweight plane ,COMMA you're able to get it up there .PERIOD
We couldn't bring one here to fly it and show you .PERIOD
But there's a lot of technology going .PERIOD
Sorry .PERIOD
It never makes a mistake .PERIOD Because if you make a mistake ,COMMA you don't leave any progeny .PERIOD
In concluding ,COMMA I want to get back to the big picture and I have just two final slides to try and put it in perspective .PERIOD
And so I just put robotic and natural cockroaches out there ,COMMA but you can fill in whatever you want .PERIOD This is not a forecast .PERIOD
Last night we gave it a few too many turns and it tried to bash the roof out also .PERIOD It's about a gram .PERIOD
Thank you .PERIOD
And despite their ferocious appearance ,COMMA Tasmanian devils are actually quite adorable little animals .PERIOD
But inevitably ,COMMA these tumors progress towards being enormous ,COMMA ulcerating tumors like this one here .PERIOD
They were too young to survive without their mother .PERIOD
Scientists around the world were intrigued by this cancer ,COMMA this infectious cancer ,COMMA that was spreading through the Tasmanian devil population .PERIOD
I myself had a tumor removed from my large intestine when I was only 14 .PERIOD
Paradoxically ,COMMA once established ,COMMA natural selection actually favors the continued growth of cancer .PERIOD
So cancer could be thought of as a strange ,COMMA short-lived ,COMMA self-destructive life form -- an evolutionary dead end .PERIOD
In fact ,COMMA more genetic profiling told us that this tumor in Jonas actually probably first arose from the cells of a female Tasmanian devil -- and Jonas was clearly a male .PERIOD
So how come a tumor that arose from the cells of another individual is growing on Jonas' face ?QUESTIONMARK
Well the next breakthrough came from studying hundreds of Tasmanian devil cancers from all around Tasmania .PERIOD
They tend to bite each other ,COMMA often quite ferociously and usually on the face .PERIOD
But if this can happen in Tasmanian devils ,COMMA why hasn't it happened in other animals or even humans ?QUESTIONMARK
Well the answer is ,COMMA it has .PERIOD
She took him to the vet and the vet discovered something quite disgusting .PERIOD
So we've seen that this can happen in animals .PERIOD
Ad he decided to put this to the test by actually deliberately inoculating people with cancer from somebody else .PERIOD
Most of the people that Dr .PERIOD Southam injected did not go on to develop cancer from the injected cells .PERIOD
And I think that this is something that oncologists and epidemiologists should be aware of in the future .PERIOD
Why has the record been so poor ?QUESTIONMARK
Because after years of stagnation and decline ,COMMA the mentality of politics is that it's a zero-sum game .PERIOD
The Security Council typically has the responsibility for providing the peacekeepers who build the security .PERIOD
It does increase security .PERIOD
One is jobs .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA that is difficult .PERIOD
So we need to encourage the growth of local firms .PERIOD
And it's schizophrenic because in their hearts donors know that's not a realistic agenda ,COMMA and so what they also do is the total bypass :COLON just fund NGOs .PERIOD
It's to split the functions of a monopoly line ministry up into three .PERIOD
So they wouldn't be provided thanks to the United States government and some NGO .PERIOD
And basically ,COMMA what I'd like to tell you is that power is changing ,COMMA and there are two types of changes I want to discuss .PERIOD
What we're going to see in the 21 st century is Asia gradually returning to being more than half of the world's population and more than half of the world's product .PERIOD
It's not just prevailing at war ,COMMA though war still persists .PERIOD
If we try to focus on the reality ,COMMA then what we need to focus on is what's really happening in terms of China and the United States .PERIOD
And that the Chinese won't catch up or pass the Americans until somewhere in the latter part ,COMMA after 2050 ,COMMA of this century .PERIOD
Why does it matter ?QUESTIONMARK Who cares ?QUESTIONMARK
The answer is it matters quite a lot .PERIOD
So empowering China to deal with its own problems of carbon is good for everybody ,COMMA and it's not a zero sum ,COMMA I win ,COMMA you lose .PERIOD
How do we define our national interests so that it's not just zero sum ,COMMA but positive sum .PERIOD
The world has a new mania .PERIOD
A mania for learning English .PERIOD
T :COLON I don't want to let myself down .PERIOD
T :COLON Perfect !EXCLAMATIONMARK S :COLON Perfect !EXCLAMATIONMARK
S :COLON I want to change my life !EXCLAMATIONMARK
So is English mania good or bad ?QUESTIONMARK
And now English is becoming the language of problem-solving .PERIOD
It's a true feeling .PERIOD
Why is this old table in your office ?QUESTIONMARK
And as I grew up ,COMMA I heard so much knowledge and so many insights and so much wisdom come out around this table ,COMMA I began to call it the wisdom table .PERIOD
And I was so shocked ,COMMA so stunned ,COMMA I got up and said ,COMMA Well ,COMMA thank you ,COMMA but what do I do ?QUESTIONMARK
And that question cleared the space .PERIOD
This film is called World Peace and Other 4 th Grade Achievements .PERIOD
And it's a beautiful thing .PERIOD
And I saw Miss Ethel J .PERIOD Banks who wore pearls and high-heels to elementary school every day .PERIOD
And I'm not even talking about you behind me ,COMMA because I've got eyes in the back of my head .PERIOD
And really ,COMMA I feel as though ,COMMA when I see the film -- I have a gesture she does ,COMMA like this -- I feel like I am a continuation of her gesture .PERIOD
And so this World Peace Game I'd like to tell you about .PERIOD
I didn't want to lecture or have just book reading .PERIOD
I offer them the job ,COMMA they can turn it down ,COMMA and then they choose their own cabinet .PERIOD
That's not all .PERIOD
I throw them into this complex matrix ,COMMA and they trust me because we have a deep ,COMMA rich relationship together .PERIOD
There's oil spills ,COMMA environmental disasters ,COMMA water rights disputes ,COMMA breakaway republics ,COMMA famine ,COMMA endangered species and global warming .PERIOD
I have no chance to make any policy whatsoever once they start playing .PERIOD
And because I don't know ,COMMA they've got to dig up the answer .PERIOD
My question to you is ,COMMA who's in charge of that classroom ?QUESTIONMARK
And we were very upset .PERIOD
I could not have designed that in teaching it .PERIOD
It'll be more realer if she reads it .PERIOD
We have a lot of data ,COMMA but I think sometimes we go beyond data with the real truth of what's going on .PERIOD
And there are three seconds left on the clock .PERIOD
I joined Telco ,COMMA made TATA trucks ,COMMA pretty close to Pune .PERIOD
So I took one year off ,COMMA and I went to this village science program .PERIOD
This square might look very square and prim .PERIOD
But give a child a triangle ,COMMA he can't do a thing to it .PERIOD
They always make a triangular roof .PERIOD
Now this is people science .PERIOD
The insects are eaten by the frogs ;SEMICOLON the frogs are eaten by the snakes ;SEMICOLON the snakes are eaten by the eagles .PERIOD
And you put a little fan here .PERIOD
And this is a hundred-year-old toy .PERIOD
I just put this inside this .PERIOD
The most expensive thing is the battery inside this .PERIOD
This is an old bicycle tube ,COMMA which gives you a broad rubber band ,COMMA two safety pins .PERIOD
It's the interaction of both these magnets which makes this motor spin .PERIOD
There are six layers -- three layers of plastic ,COMMA aluminum -- which are are sealed together .PERIOD
I'm going to keep this outside ,COMMA to blow out .PERIOD I'm going to suck in air .PERIOD
Well before I go any further ,COMMA this is something worth sharing .PERIOD
If I crank the handle ,COMMA all the wool goes inside .PERIOD
There are 12 million blind children in our country -- who live in a world of darkness .PERIOD
When first you see Nehru and Gandhi ,COMMA this is the Nehru cap -- just half a newspaper .PERIOD
And the second night ,COMMA he would take the same cap and give it another fold .PERIOD
And there's a third one over here .PERIOD
Firstly ,COMMA radical increases in resource efficiency .PERIOD
And for all three of these ,COMMA I believe ,COMMA biomimicry has a lot of the solutions that we're going to need .PERIOD
And I'm just going to talk through this animation .PERIOD
And just as natural systems tend to increase in diversity and resilience over time ,COMMA there's a real sense with this project that the number of possibilities just continue increasing .PERIOD
And the kind of elements I'm talking about are ,COMMA firstly ,COMMA we have a restaurant inside a productive greenhouse ,COMMA a bit like this one in Amsterdam called De Kas .PERIOD
So for instance ,COMMA when Julius Caesar arrived in North Africa ,COMMA huge areas of North Africa were covered in cedar and cypress forests .PERIOD
The converse is also true .PERIOD
The more vegetation we lose ,COMMA the more that's likely to exacerbate climate change and lead to further desertification .PERIOD
The way it does this is it comes out at night ,COMMA crawls to the top of a sand dune ,COMMA and because it's got a matte black shell ,COMMA is able to radiate heat out to the night sky and become slightly cooler than its surroundings .PERIOD
And the ingenuity ,COMMA if you could call it that ,COMMA goes even further .PERIOD
Between them there's a waxy finish which repels water .PERIOD
We're working with the guy who invented the Seawater Greenhouse .PERIOD
This is a greenhouse designed for arid coastal regions ,COMMA and the way it works is that you have this whole wall of evaporator grills ,COMMA and you trickle seawater over that so that wind blows through ,COMMA it picks up a lot of moisture and is cooled in the process .PERIOD
And what they found with the first Seawater Greenhouse that was built was it was producing slightly more freshwater than it needed for the plants inside .PERIOD
And when you think about nature ,COMMA often you think about it as being all about competition .PERIOD
You think ,COMMA What can I add to the system to create more value ?QUESTIONMARK
And it turns out that different things crystallize out at different stages .PERIOD
Now we would be able to make use of all that waste brine .PERIOD
We could evaporate it to enhance the restorative benefits and capture the salts ,COMMA transforming an urgent waste problem into a big opportunity .PERIOD
Far too much of the talk about the environment uses very negative language .PERIOD
And this is an important point .PERIOD
There are very few doctors and ,COMMA quite frankly ,COMMA these countries do not have the resources that are needed to cope with such epidemics .PERIOD
Very simple .PERIOD
And knowing that starts to explain a lot of long-standing mysteries in science .PERIOD
It also brings up new issues ,COMMA though ,COMMA like computational irreducibility .PERIOD
You know ,COMMA in working on this science for many years ,COMMA I kept wondering ,COMMA What will be its first killer app ?QUESTIONMARK
Let's start off with something really easy .PERIOD
And it should be able to tell us that .PERIOD
let's say the revenue of Microsoft .PERIOD
Well ,COMMA even starting from Mathematica ,COMMA this is still a huge amount of work .PERIOD
Well ,COMMA a crucial idea of Wolfram Alpha is that you can just ask it questions using ordinary human language ,COMMA which means that we've got to be able to take all those strange utterances that people type into the input field and understand them .PERIOD
And I must say that I thought that step might just be plain impossible .PERIOD
Right now ,COMMA if we look at web queries ,COMMA more than 80 percent of them get handled successfully the first time .PERIOD
And when one does that ,COMMA one really changes the economics of delivering computational things ,COMMA whether it's on the web or elsewhere .PERIOD
I'll show you one example here .PERIOD
Something like Rule 30 ,COMMA for example ,COMMA turns out to be a really good randomness generator .PERIOD
So could that be what's going on with our whole universe ?QUESTIONMARK
But in at least a large class of cases ,COMMA one can think of the universe as being like some kind of network ,COMMA which ,COMMA when it gets big enough ,COMMA behaves like continuous space in much the same way as having lots of molecules can behave like a continuous fluid .PERIOD
Actually ,COMMA I haven't shown these before ,COMMA but here are a few of the candidate universes that I've looked at .PERIOD
Benoit Mandelbrot is in the audience .PERIOD
We've questioned the future of capitalism .PERIOD
And the idea is a simple ,COMMA simple idea ,COMMA which is the fact that the consumer has moved from a state of anxiety to action .PERIOD
The consumer is empowered .PERIOD
Do you know what this was right here ?QUESTIONMARK
And what you end up seeing is the whole phenomenon of the fact that we are actually stepping forth and basically leveraging future education ,COMMA future children in our households .PERIOD
However ,COMMA consumers have moved .PERIOD
Dentists report molars ,COMMA you know ,COMMA people grinding their teeth ,COMMA coming in and reporting the fact that they've had stress .PERIOD
But seriously ,COMMA what we see happening ,COMMA and the reason I want to stress that the consumer is not in retreat ,COMMA is that this is a tremendous opportunity for the consumer who drove us into this recession to lead us right back out .PERIOD
We see high-end haggling in fashion today .PERIOD
So ,COMMA from a value and values standpoint ,COMMA what companies can do is connect in lots of different ways .PERIOD
Gore-Tex is all about personal accountability of their management and their employees ,COMMA to the point where they really kind of shun the idea of bosses .PERIOD
The third of the four laws of post-crisis consumerism is about durable living .PERIOD
I was fascinated to learn that 30 percent of all homes in America are actually built by owners .PERIOD
Let's look at a couple of quick examples .PERIOD
You need to harness it .PERIOD You need to give it meaning .PERIOD
This Kogi doesn't exist .PERIOD It's a moving truck .PERIOD Right ?QUESTIONMARK
Or you look at Johnson &amp ;SEMICOLON Johnson's Momversations .PERIOD
You see this rising force in sort of total transparency and openness that companies are starting to adopt ,COMMA all because the consumer is demanding it .PERIOD
But ,COMMA at the same time ,COMMA this is also a tremendous opportunity .PERIOD
So ,COMMA I decided to investigate .PERIOD
So ,COMMA I'm going to challenge all of you .PERIOD
We talk about world peace .PERIOD
And I want to thank all of you in the audience for being great husbands ,COMMA great mothers ,COMMA friends ,COMMA daughters ,COMMA sons .PERIOD
That's what I do in life -- telling stories ,COMMA writing novels -- and today I would like to tell you a few stories about the art of storytelling and also some supernatural creatures called the djinni .PERIOD
I was born in Strasbourg ,COMMA France to Turkish parents .PERIOD
In response she said ,COMMA Yes ,COMMA praying is effective ,COMMA but also beware of the power of circles .PERIOD
We all do .PERIOD
Our friends ,COMMA neighbors ,COMMA colleagues ,COMMA family -- if all the people in our inner circle resemble us ,COMMA it means we are surrounded with our mirror image .PERIOD
Instead ,COMMA it generated an atmosphere in which each child was seen -- not as an individual on his own ,COMMA but as the representative of something larger .PERIOD
I came to learn that these were the three main stereotypes about my country :COLON politics ,COMMA cigarettes and the veil .PERIOD
I lived in a very vibrant ,COMMA diverse neighborhood where I wrote several of my novels .PERIOD
What I experienced as a child in that school in Madrid is happening in the literary world today .PERIOD
Meanwhile ,COMMA the other leg draws a wide circle ,COMMA constantly moving .PERIOD
We see them as the domain of supernatural creatures like the djinn ,COMMA who are made of smokeless fire and are the symbol of elusiveness .PERIOD
Perhaps that's not the right way to start at all .PERIOD
You see there ,COMMA it's about 620 billion a year .PERIOD
R&ampD in total in the economy ,COMMA publicly funded ,COMMA is about 06 percent of GDP .PERIOD
The first thing I want to say ,COMMA and this is straight from Wonders of the Solar System ,COMMA is that our exploration of the solar system and the universe has shown us that it is indescribably beautiful .PERIOD
So ,COMMA tiny moon .PERIOD
That's fascinating and beautiful in itself ,COMMA but we think that the mechanism for powering those fountains requires there to be lakes of liquid water beneath the surface of this moon .PERIOD
And what's important about that is that ,COMMA on our planet ,COMMA on Earth ,COMMA wherever we find liquid water ,COMMA we find life .PERIOD
Tremendous and beautiful discovery .PERIOD
And they saw strange pictures like this .PERIOD
It's called helios -- helios from the Sun .PERIOD
That's a Type Ia supernova explosion .PERIOD
It sits there about ,COMMA say ,COMMA 13 times the mass of the Sun .PERIOD
I think that's a remarkable demonstration of the power and beauty and universality of the laws of physics ,COMMA because we understand that process ,COMMA because we understand the structure of atoms here on Earth .PERIOD
And if I blow it up there ,COMMA you see it .PERIOD
But it visited Jupiter ,COMMA Saturn ,COMMA Uranus and Neptune .PERIOD
You could have made it in the 1890 s ;SEMICOLON you wouldn't have the transistor .PERIOD
Let me leave the last words to someone who's rapidly becoming a hero of mine ,COMMA Humphrey Davy ,COMMA who did his science at the turn of the 19 th century .PERIOD
Thank you .PERIOD
Streets have names ;SEMICOLON blocks are just the unnamed spaces in between streets .PERIOD
They say ,COMMA Oh ,COMMA well that's Block 17 and this is Block 16 .PERIOD
Just look at Google Maps here .PERIOD There's Block 14 ,COMMA 15 ,COMMA 16 ,COMMA 17 ,COMMA 18 ,COMMA 19 .PERIOD
You say ,COMMA OK ,COMMA but walking around the neighborhood ,COMMA I noticed that the house numbers don't go in order .PERIOD
It's a phenomenon on the Internet today called behavioral tracking ,COMMA and it is very big business .PERIOD
Our daughter then joined us at the breakfast table ,COMMA and I asked her ,COMMA Is there an emphasis on music literacy in your school ?QUESTIONMARK
I go to work ,COMMA I check email ,COMMA I log onto a few more social sites ,COMMA I blog ,COMMA I check more news reports ,COMMA I share some of those news reports ,COMMA I go look at some videos ,COMMA pretty typical day -- in this case ,COMMA actually fairly pedantic -- and at the end of the day ,COMMA as my day winds down ,COMMA look at my profile .PERIOD
And I’d say ,COMMA Well ,COMMA I’m walking for the environment .PERIOD
I called my parents up .PERIOD
And so I did .PERIOD
It’s only 500 miles .PERIOD
I had written the University of Montana two years earlier and said I'd like to go to school there .PERIOD
But I use that story because they really wanted to help me .PERIOD
I had 13 students when I first walked into the class .PERIOD
I could see they were looking for the schedule ,COMMA to see when they could get out .PERIOD
They had to take that class with me .PERIOD
And on Earth Day ,COMMA 1990 -- the 20 th anniversary of Earth Day -- that’s when I began to speak .PERIOD
I got on a sailboat and I sailed down to the Caribbean ,COMMA and walked through all of the islands ,COMMA and to Venezuela .PERIOD
And I got to -- I start saying ,COMMA Free at last -- thank God Almighty ,COMMA I’m free at last .PERIOD
I had no idea I was going to become a UN .PERIOD Ambassador .PERIOD
I was going to have to change .PERIOD
I know I needed to change ,COMMA because it would be the only way that I could be here today .PERIOD
When does learning begin ?QUESTIONMARK
Well today I want to present to you an idea that may be surprising and may even seem implausible ,COMMA but which is supported by the latest evidence from psychology and biology .PERIOD
Now I'm a science reporter .PERIOD
I write books and magazine articles .PERIOD
The flavors of the food a pregnant woman eats find their way into the amniotic fluid ,COMMA which is continuously swallowed by the fetus .PERIOD
What this means is that fetuses are effectively being taught by their mothers about what is safe and good to eat .PERIOD
The pregnant woman's diet and stress level in particular provide important clues to prevailing conditions like a finger lifted to the wind .PERIOD
The Hunger Winter ,COMMA as it came to be known ,COMMA killed some 10000 people and weakened thousands more .PERIOD
Learning is one of life's most essential activities ,COMMA and it begins much earlier than we ever imagined .PERIOD
You'd still have five billion left in change ,COMMA and people would ask for the trains to be slowed down .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA years after you remember the strategic question of whether you're flying in a 777 or an Airbus ,COMMA you remember those words and that experience .PERIOD
I mean ,COMMA it could almost be rather like that scene from the film Airplane .PERIOD
I spoke about this before ,COMMA and a brilliant person got in touch with me and said ,COMMA Okay ,COMMA what can you do ?QUESTIONMARK
One of them also being ,COMMA although logically it's quite a good idea to have a lift with no up and down button in it ,COMMA if it only serves two floors ,COMMA it's actually bloody terrifying ,COMMA okay ?QUESTIONMARK
They said ,COMMA Can we do an advertising campaign ?QUESTIONMARK
I said ,COMMA It's really ,COMMA really easy .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA interesting that no single person does that ,COMMA or at least can admit to being so anal as to do it .PERIOD
Moving over ,COMMA we come ,COMMA of course ,COMMA to consultancy .PERIOD
I mean ,COMMA Tiger surely was actually obeying the Accenture model .PERIOD
That's why I call for the Chief Detail Officer .PERIOD
But as I was moving away from the traditional classical repertoire and trying to find new ways of musical expression ,COMMA I realized that with today's technological resources ,COMMA there's no reason to limit what can be produced at one time from a single string instrument .PERIOD
But what actually interests me a lot more is the fact that in the tip of each controller is a relatively high-performing infrared camera .PERIOD
And I also was taught ,COMMA coupled with that ,COMMA that it was my job -- this classroom full of five and six year-old children -- it was our job ,COMMA apparently ,COMMA to help .PERIOD
This is what Jesus asked of us .PERIOD
That was news to me ,COMMA and it felt like it was a very important thing to get to participate in .PERIOD
And I felt overwhelmed .PERIOD
And I didn't know what would happen when I ran out of things to give ,COMMA especially if the problem was never going away .PERIOD
I heard about things that were going wrong in the lives of the poor .PERIOD
I started to feel guilty for my own relative wealth ,COMMA because I wasn't doing more ,COMMA apparently ,COMMA to make things better .PERIOD
It became a transaction for me ,COMMA became sort of a trade .PERIOD
So I spent three months in Kenya ,COMMA Uganda and Tanzania interviewing entrepreneurs that had received 100 dollars to start or grow a business .PERIOD
I was starting to be friends and get to know their personal stories .PERIOD
But there were these beautiful details ,COMMA even if I talked to 20 goat herders in a row ,COMMA and some days that's what happened -- these beautiful details of life change that were meaningful to them .PERIOD
I never once was asked for a donation ,COMMA which had kind of been my mode ,COMMA right .PERIOD
We sent it over to Uganda .PERIOD
When you lend them money ,COMMA and they slowly pay you back over time ,COMMA you have this excuse to have an ongoing dialogue .PERIOD
So the mapping of participating in the story ,COMMA it actually flows with the up and down .PERIOD
We make it really ,COMMA really simple for me as well as anyone else who wants to use the site .PERIOD
But the good news is I don't think I need to stand here and convince you to care -- I'm not even going to try .PERIOD
And I'm grateful that whenever I do that ,COMMA guaranteed ,COMMA I am inspired -- I am inspired by the person I am listening to .PERIOD
What is the future of the human race ?QUESTIONMARK
If not ,COMMA what created the universe ?QUESTIONMARK
First ,COMMA there were the laws like Maxwell's equations and general relativity that determined the evolution of the universe ,COMMA given its state over all of space at one time .PERIOD
However ,COMMA this division into laws of evolution and initial conditions depends on time and space being separate and distinct .PERIOD
Indeed ,COMMA it has probably given me more time than most people to pursue the quest for knowledge .PERIOD
Professor Hawking ,COMMA thank you for that answer .PERIOD
I'm a geologist by training .PERIOD But I love that .PERIOD
Here we're going to see one backing into a crevice ,COMMA and watch his tentacles -- he just pulls them in ,COMMA makes them look just like algae .PERIOD
That's an amazing thing .PERIOD
and an octopus .PERIOD Ain't that amazing ?QUESTIONMARK Now ,COMMA Roger spooked him so he took off in a cloud of ink ,COMMA and when he lands the octopus says ,COMMA Oh ,COMMA I've been seen .PERIOD
And now he's gone ,COMMA and so am I .PERIOD Thank you very much .PERIOD
That's the Lucy species ,COMMA and was found by my research team in December of 2000 in an area called Dikika .PERIOD
It's in the northeastern part of Ethiopia .PERIOD
You don't just jump into an invitation .PERIOD
First entertainment comes evidence from flutes that are 35000 years old .PERIOD
When you get there ,COMMA this is what you see ,COMMA and it's the vastness of the place which makes you feel helpless and vulnerable .PERIOD
You find elephants ,COMMA rhinos ,COMMA monkeys ,COMMA pigs ,COMMA etc .PERIOD
Again ,COMMA another one ,COMMA That's a monkey .PERIOD That's a pig ,COMMA etc .PERIOD
Here is a close-up of the fossil ,COMMA after five years of cleaning ,COMMA preparation and description ,COMMA which was very long ,COMMA and I had to expose the bones from the sandstone block I just showed you in the previous slide .PERIOD
So then ,COMMA once you've done that ,COMMA the next stage is to know what it is .PERIOD
You don't see that in chimpanzees ,COMMA and you don't see this very projecting canine .PERIOD
And how old was she when she died ?QUESTIONMARK
That's why we need care from our parents .PERIOD
So ,COMMA by being at the cusp of our evolutionary history ,COMMA Selam unites us all and gives us a unique account on what makes us human .PERIOD
Up to now ,COMMA the knowledge that we had about our ancestors came essentially from adult individuals because the fossils ,COMMA the baby fossils ,COMMA were missing .PERIOD
Imagine somebody coming from Mars and his job is to report on the type of people occupying our planet Earth ,COMMA and you hide all the babies ,COMMA the children ,COMMA and he goes back and reports .PERIOD
And they were probably not aware of this future legacy ,COMMA but they did great .PERIOD
With an average depth of the oceans of 4000 meters ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA the high seas covers and provides nearly 90 percent of the habitat for life on this Earth .PERIOD
It is ,COMMA in theory ,COMMA the global commons ,COMMA belonging to us all .PERIOD
So here is a picture of the high seas as seen from above -- that area in the darker blue .PERIOD
And of course ,COMMA if you want people to play by the rules ,COMMA you still need an effective system of monitoring and enforcement ,COMMA for as we've discovered ,COMMA you can trust ,COMMA but you also need to verify .PERIOD
It's also known as the spawning ground for eels from Northern European and Northern American rivers that are now so dwindling in numbers that they've actually stopped showing up in Stockholm ,COMMA and five showed up in the UK .PERIOD just recently .PERIOD
It's actually a bay .PERIOD
Coming closer to here ,COMMA the Costa Rica Dome is a recently discovered area -- potentially year-round habitat for blue whales .PERIOD
That is ,COMMA it provides a wonderful example of where you can go with a real regional initiative .PERIOD
So what we've been suggesting is that we either need to amend the World Heritage Convention ,COMMA so that it can adopt and urge universal protection of these World Heritage sites ,COMMA or we need to change the name and call it Half-the-World Heritage Convention .PERIOD
What I find so exciting is that the Census of Marine Life has looked at more than the tagging of pacific predators ;SEMICOLON it's also looked in the really unexplored mid-water column ,COMMA where creatures like this flying sea cucumber have been found .PERIOD
And the exciting thing is that we do have sufficient information to move ahead to protect some of these significant hope spots ,COMMA hotspots .PERIOD
But not all the vessels have those to date .PERIOD
We need to get the new paradigm of precaution and respect .PERIOD
So here we are ,COMMA seven years ,COMMA 500 interviews later ,COMMA and I'm gonna tell you what really leads to success and makes TED-sters tick .PERIOD
And the first thing I say to them is :COLON OK ,COMMA well you can't serve yourself ;SEMICOLON you gotta serve others something of value .PERIOD
While that might be a somewhat morbid thought ,COMMA I think it has some really profound implications that are worth exploring .PERIOD
But today we're all creating this incredibly rich digital archive that's going to live in the cloud indefinitely ,COMMA years after we're gone .PERIOD
And what this lets you do is create an online tribute to your loved ones ,COMMA complete with photos and videos and stories that they can post after you die .PERIOD
But what I think comes next is far more interesting .PERIOD
Now we're already starting to see some experiments here .PERIOD
Taking it a step further ,COMMA MIT's media lab is working on robots that can interact more like humans .PERIOD
It's not that it's not possible to feed ,COMMA clothe and house us all and have us live decent lives .PERIOD
And that's what will happen to us .PERIOD
I accept where we are .PERIOD
The future is inherently uncertain .PERIOD
Imagine our highly-tuned ,COMMA just-in-time food industry and our highly-stressed agricultural system failing and supermarket shelves emptying .PERIOD
If we feel it now and think it through ,COMMA we will realize we have nothing to fear but fear itself .PERIOD
We can do this .PERIOD
I know the free market fundamentalists will tell you that more growth ,COMMA more stuff and nine billion people going shopping is the best we can do .PERIOD
We have achieved remarkable things since working out how to grow food some 10000 years ago .PERIOD
We've built a powerful foundation of science ,COMMA knowledge and technology -- more than enough to build a society where nine billion people can lead decent ,COMMA meaningful and satisfying lives .PERIOD
We can choose this moment of crisis to ask and answer the big questions of society's evolution -- like ,COMMA what do we want to be when we grow up ,COMMA when we move past this bumbling adolescence where we think there are no limits and suffer delusions of immortality ?QUESTIONMARK
We can choose life over fear .PERIOD
And one more thing :COLON Archie was suffering from this illness himself .PERIOD
So the situation seemed pretty desperate .PERIOD
He gives half of them vitamin B 12 .PERIOD
So Cochrane then goes to the Germans who are running the prison camp .PERIOD
And he can't understand how this barbarism can be tolerated ,COMMA and he vents his frustrations .PERIOD
So the symptoms of the complex are ,COMMA no matter how complicated the problem ,COMMA you have an absolutely overwhelming belief that you are infallibly right in your solution .PERIOD
You could count them in five minutes .PERIOD
What is evolution ?QUESTIONMARK
How do you do it ?QUESTIONMARK
It falls to the floor .PERIOD
You make lots of money .PERIOD
Ten percent of Americans don't disappear every year .PERIOD
I sometimes wonder .PERIOD
Now I've been sort of banging on about this for the last couple of months ,COMMA and people sometimes say to me ,COMMA Well Tim ,COMMA it's kind of obvious .PERIOD
And there's an authority figure in the corner behind the teacher's desk who knows all the answers .PERIOD
When schools stop doing that all the time ,COMMA I will admit that ,COMMA yes ,COMMA it's obvious that trial and error is a good thing .PERIOD
Until then ,COMMA until then I'm going to keep banging on about trial and error and why we should abandon the God complex .PERIOD
They had the God complex in spades .PERIOD
And after the trial had been running for a little while ,COMMA he gathered together all his colleagues around his table ,COMMA and he said ,COMMA Well ,COMMA gentlemen ,COMMA we have some preliminary results .PERIOD
Shut it down at once .PERIOD
Tumbleweed rolls through the meeting room .PERIOD
It isn't easy .PERIOD
So shortly after the war ,COMMA this young man ,COMMA Yutaka Taniyama ,COMMA developed this amazing conjecture called the Taniyama-Shimura Conjecture .PERIOD
In fact ,COMMA it turns out it's equivalent to proving Fermat's Last Theorem .PERIOD
You prove one ,COMMA you prove the other .PERIOD
And the problem with leverage is it makes the US .PERIOD financial system look like this .PERIOD
That means every bad loan goes bad 47 times over .PERIOD
And as you think about that ,COMMA you've got to wonder :COLON so what do banks have in store for you now ?QUESTIONMARK
Except we've been so busy giving away a trillion here ,COMMA a trillion there ,COMMA that we've brought that date of reckoning forward to about 2017 .PERIOD
We're going to start to pay them .PERIOD
This guy runs the China Investment Corporation .PERIOD
This is an actual bill .PERIOD
If you look at the federal budget ,COMMA this is what it looks like .PERIOD
Everything else is mandated .PERIOD
That's the short term .PERIOD That's the flame part .PERIOD
Among other things ,COMMA because startup companies are .PERIOD 02 percent of US .PERIOD GDP investmentm and they're about 178 percent of output .PERIOD
Twenty-one countries came together .PERIOD Dozens of teams .PERIOD
Two years ago ,COMMA you saw this creature .PERIOD
But then if you lose one of those second set of teeth ,COMMA they don't regrow ,COMMA unless ,COMMA if you're a lawyer .PERIOD
So there are now nine women walking around Boston with re-grown bladders ,COMMA which is much more pleasant than walking around with a whole bunch of plastic bags for the rest of your life .PERIOD
If you don't have a flat world ,COMMA that's not good ,COMMA which is why the robot's we're designing today are a little different .PERIOD
And this stuff is moving very quickly ,COMMA and by the way ,COMMA that thing can carry about 350 pounds of weight .PERIOD
And about two or three years after they can hear as well as you and I can ,COMMA they'll be able to hear maybe how bats sing ,COMMA or how whales talk ,COMMA or how dogs talk ,COMMA and other types of tonal scales .PERIOD
This is a group in Germany that's beginning to engineer eyes so that people who are blind can begin to see light and dark .PERIOD
Very primitive .PERIOD
They'll do stuff you and I can't do .PERIOD
And it's the 150 th anniversary of the publication of The Origin of Species .PERIOD
Maybe not .PERIOD
Once upon a time ,COMMA there was a dread disease that afflicted children .PERIOD
And so ,COMMA as a consequence ,COMMA a few years later ,COMMA another scientist -- perhaps maybe this scientist not quite as brilliant as the one who had preceded him ,COMMA but building on the invention of the first one -- came up with a second cure .PERIOD
And the beauty of the second cure for this disease was that it could be used on infants and one-year-olds .PERIOD
And the government ,COMMA they heard her story and the other people ,COMMA and they said ,COMMA Yeah ,COMMA you're right ,COMMA we should make a law .PERIOD
We would lose all of our market .PERIOD
So ,COMMA many times when you try to do research on data ,COMMA it records complicated stories -- it's hard to find in the data .PERIOD
And then finally ,COMMA the last set of bars ,COMMA which are really controlling for everything you could possibly imagine about the crash ,COMMA 50 ,COMMA 75 ,COMMA 100 different characteristics of the crash .PERIOD
And the other thing you might argue is ,COMMA Well ,COMMA car seats have got a lot better over time .PERIOD
So they just have these bench seats ,COMMA and they strap the car seat and the seatbelt onto it .PERIOD
Anyway ,COMMA it turns out that those two crashes ,COMMA that actually the three-year-old did slightly worse .PERIOD So ,COMMA he gets about a 500 out of -- you know ,COMMA on this range -- relative to a 400 and something .PERIOD
And this seatbelt would have passed with flying colors into being approved as a car seat .PERIOD
It's in 5000 days ,COMMA all this stuff has come .PERIOD
There's two million emails per second .PERIOD
It's just a huge machine ,COMMA and it uses five percent of the global electricity on the planet .PERIOD
And in some ways ,COMMA it's sort of back to the kind of old idea of centralized computing .PERIOD
And I am suggesting that every bit will be owned by the Web .PERIOD
They're going to talk to the machine .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA with RFIDs and other things -- whatever technology it is ,COMMA it doesn't really matter .PERIOD The point is that everything will have embedded in it some sensor connecting it to the machine ,COMMA and so we have ,COMMA basically ,COMMA an Internet of things .PERIOD
But in fact ,COMMA what the new economy really is is the marriage of those two ,COMMA where we embed the information ,COMMA and the digital nature of things into the material world .PERIOD
Attention is the currency .PERIOD
And I'm saying ,COMMA Humans are now going to be the extended senses of the machine ,COMMA in a certain sense .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA the second thing that I want to talk about was this idea of restructuring ,COMMA that what the Web is doing is restructuring .PERIOD
And what you had to do was -- if you wanted to participate in this ,COMMA you had to share packets of information .PERIOD
It wasn't like a telephone system where you had control of a line :COLON you had to share packets .PERIOD
The second stage that we're in now is the idea of linking pages .PERIOD
You couldn't deny -- if someone wanted to link to you ,COMMA you couldn't stop them .PERIOD You had to participate in this idea of opening up your pages to be linked by anybody .PERIOD
So ,COMMA the last thing I want to talk about is this idea that we're going to be codependent .PERIOD
And what is happening with this is some kind of AI ,COMMA but it's not the AI in conscious AI ,COMMA as being an expert ,COMMA Larry Page told me that that's what they're trying to do ,COMMA and that's what they're trying to do .PERIOD
But it'll anticipate what we're doing ,COMMA in a good sense .PERIOD
And all these devices will be portals into that .PERIOD
It was on Jonestown .PERIOD
The top picture is a group of Moonies that have been blessed by their messiah .PERIOD
And so what is this ?QUESTIONMARK How does this work ?QUESTIONMARK
These easy ideas to complex questions are very appealing when you are emotionally vulnerable .PERIOD
We're beginning to look inside the brain .PERIOD
And so if you looked at my brain ,COMMA or any brain that's infected with a viral memetic infection like this ,COMMA and compared it to anyone in this room ,COMMA or anyone who uses critical thinking on a regular basis ,COMMA I am convinced it would look very ,COMMA very different .PERIOD
Because I have to say ,COMMA for my whole career ,COMMA if there's anything that's been consistent ,COMMA it's been that you can't do it .PERIOD
It's Calvino's idea of the quickest way between two points is the circuitous line ,COMMA not the straight line .PERIOD
We make physical things ,COMMA buildings that become a part in an accretional process ;SEMICOLON they make cities .PERIOD
And I've had for 30 years an interest in a series of complexities where a series of forces are brought to bear ,COMMA and to understand the nature of the final result of that ,COMMA representing the building itself .PERIOD
This is a project that we just finished in Penang for a very ,COMMA very large city project that came directly out of this process ,COMMA which is the result of the multiplicity of forces that produce it .PERIOD
And an image which may be closest talks about the use of light as a medium ,COMMA that light becomes literally a building material .PERIOD
This will be the first building in the United States that took -- well ,COMMA I can't say it took the air conditioning out .PERIOD It's a hybrid .PERIOD
And I understood that building really could be the augmentation of the Earth's surface ,COMMA and it completely shifted the notion of building ground in the most basic sense .PERIOD
What I'm interested in are how these ideas participate in the educational process of young people .PERIOD
One enters the building as it lifts off the ground ,COMMA and it becomes part of the idea .PERIOD
And then the skin -- the edges of this -- all promote the dynamic ,COMMA the movement of the building as a series of seismic shifts ,COMMA geologic shifts .PERIOD Right ?QUESTIONMARK
And finally ,COMMA one of the most interesting projects -- it's a courthouse .PERIOD
Here's a piano nobile ,COMMA which is a device used in the Renaissance .PERIOD
It changed the way our history developed .PERIOD
It is made for a diet which is soft ,COMMA mushy ,COMMA which is reduced in fibers ,COMMA which is very easily chewable and digestible .PERIOD
Sounds like fast food ,COMMA doesn't it .PERIOD
It's technology .PERIOD
So this ingenuity of our ancestors ,COMMA to invent this most marvelous technology .PERIOD
We populated all the ecologies .PERIOD
It keeps also your brain working .PERIOD
Okay ,COMMA it's not obvious to be honest .PERIOD
Now having a large brain ,COMMA as you know ,COMMA is a big advantage ,COMMA because you can actually influence your environment .PERIOD
You know we have up to five tastes ,COMMA three of them sustain us .PERIOD
So we can make mixtures of all this kind of thing because we know that ,COMMA in cooking ,COMMA we can transform it to the form .PERIOD
So satisfaction was a very important part .PERIOD
If you get a stomach ache ,COMMA if you get a little bit bloated ,COMMA was not the right food ,COMMA was not the right cooking manipulation or maybe other things went wrong .PERIOD
But what it means to have a brain there is that ,COMMA not only the big brain has to talk with the food ,COMMA the food has to talk with the brain ,COMMA because we have to learn actually how to talk to the brains .PERIOD
This is the layer which actually touches the food you are swallowing and you digest ,COMMA which is actually the lumen .PERIOD
What it means is that we have a layered control system .PERIOD
So if you override the hunger signal ,COMMA you can have a disorder ,COMMA which is called anorexia .PERIOD
This is fat digestion .PERIOD
Actually ,COMMA what happens is that a very intricate structure appears .PERIOD
You know ,COMMA culture was born of the imagination ,COMMA and the imagination -- the imagination as we know it -- came into being when our species descended from our progenitor ,COMMA Homo erectus ,COMMA and ,COMMA infused with consciousness ,COMMA began a journey that would carry it to every corner of the habitable world .PERIOD
And the way Clayton put it was this way .PERIOD
I recently sailed on the Hokulea ,COMMA named after the sacred star of Hawaii ,COMMA throughout the South Pacific to make a film about the navigators .PERIOD
I spent 30 years living amongst the people of Chinchero and I always heard about an event that I always wanted to participate in .PERIOD
And then you do the ritual dances that empower the crosses .PERIOD
These ,COMMA of course ,COMMA are the descendants of the ancient Tairona civilization .PERIOD
There are four societies :COLON the Kogi ,COMMA the Wiwa ,COMMA the Kankwano and the Arhuacos .PERIOD
I traveled with the Arhuacos ,COMMA and the wonderful thing about this story was that this man ,COMMA Danilo Villafane -- if we just jump back here for a second .PERIOD
We traveled high into the paramo ,COMMA and as we crested the hills ,COMMA we realized that the men were interpreting every single bump on the landscape in terms of their own intense religiosity .PERIOD
And we ran into a FARC patrol at dawn ,COMMA so it was quite harrowing .PERIOD
They dismiss the rest of us who have ruined the world as the Younger Brothers .PERIOD They cannot understand why it is that we do what we do to the Earth .PERIOD
And when asked that question ,COMMA they respond with 6000 different voices .PERIOD
They are unique answers to that fundamental question :COLON what does it mean to be human and alive ?QUESTIONMARK
So ,COMMA you're living through a time when virtually half of humanity's intellectual ,COMMA social and spiritual legacy is being allowed to slip away .PERIOD
This does not have to happen .PERIOD
So ,COMMA I'd like to spend a few minutes with you folks today imagining what our planet might look like in a thousand years .PERIOD
This is crazy .PERIOD
If you're in Northern Europe or North America ,COMMA you can use things like buckwheat husks or oat hulls .PERIOD
Because the manufacturing process is our organism .PERIOD
They're not going to clog up Earth's ecosystems .PERIOD They work great .PERIOD
My brief ,COMMA as you've just heard ,COMMA is to tell you about statistics -- and ,COMMA to be more precise ,COMMA to tell you some exciting things about statistics .PERIOD
Don't tell her I said that .PERIOD
She paused and said ,COMMA He models things .PERIOD
The next time ,COMMA after the 15 th toss .PERIOD
That's what I want this side to think about .PERIOD
Either they're the same ,COMMA or this one's bigger than this one ,COMMA or this one's bigger than that one .PERIOD
Who thinks that C is true -- that ,COMMA on average ,COMMA it'll take less time to see head-tail-head than head-tail-tail ?QUESTIONMARK
The champagne's on ice just next to you ;SEMICOLON you've got the glasses chilled to celebrate .PERIOD
And if it comes down a head ,COMMA that's great .PERIOD
It's the same for the first two parts of the sequence .PERIOD
If it's a head you're disappointed ,COMMA but you're still a third of the way to your pattern again .PERIOD
This is my little diversion into my real passion ,COMMA which is genetics .PERIOD
When you toss a coin ,COMMA you get a sequence of heads and tails .PERIOD
And they're an enormously useful tool in modern molecular biology .PERIOD
But it turns out that unlocking the secrets in the information generated by modern experimental technologies ,COMMA a key part of that has to do with fairly sophisticated -- you'll be relieved to know that I do something useful in my day job ,COMMA rather more sophisticated than the head-tail-head story -- but quite sophisticated computer modelings and mathematical modelings and modern statistical techniques .PERIOD
It's not the answer ,COMMA and it's not because it's only part of the story .PERIOD
Here's a little caricature of a million individuals .PERIOD
Those of you in Britain will know about what's become rather a celebrated case of a woman called Sally Clark ,COMMA who had two babies who died suddenly .PERIOD
And to argue ,COMMA then ,COMMA that the chance of a second death is as if you didn't know that information is really silly .PERIOD
One of them is that Sally Clark was innocent -- which is ,COMMA a priori ,COMMA overwhelmingly likely -- most mothers don't kill their children .PERIOD
So just to conclude -- what are the take-home messages from this ?QUESTIONMARK
We are not good at reasoning with uncertainty .PERIOD
All of quality control ,COMMA which has had a major impact on industrial processing ,COMMA is underpinned by statistics .PERIOD
This is a world-changing invention .PERIOD
Well it turns out that the main causes are faulty and misused appliances and electrical wiring .PERIOD
Hmmm .PERIOD
So far we've applied for 414 patent claims .PERIOD
So ,COMMA to conclude ,COMMA intelligent power can ,COMMA globally ,COMMA save thousands of lives ,COMMA prevent tens of thousands of injuries ,COMMA and eliminate tens of billions of dollars in property damage every single year ,COMMA while significantly reducing global energy consumption .PERIOD
In the spirit of this year's TED Conference ,COMMA we think this is a powerful ,COMMA world-changing invention .PERIOD
And that's what I'd like to talk to you a little bit about today .PERIOD
It's acoustic vibrations in the air ,COMMA little waves of energy in the air that tickle our eardrum .PERIOD
And it's at the hair cell level that they do this .PERIOD
In fact ,COMMA nothing even actually comes close to our ability to restore hearing .PERIOD
And as a physician and a surgeon ,COMMA I can confidently tell my patients that if you had to pick a sense to lose ,COMMA we are the furthest along medically and surgically with hearing .PERIOD
Okay ,COMMA play that video please .PERIOD
I'm saying that they're going to face obstacles that most people who have normal hearing will not have to face .PERIOD
Now hearing loss and the treatment for hearing loss has really evolved in the past 200 years .PERIOD
I mean literally ,COMMA they used to do things like stick ear-shaped objects onto your ears and stick funnels in .PERIOD
Language is very different .PERIOD Language is very precise .PERIOD
In fact ,COMMA the whole reason we use it is because it has semantic-specificity .PERIOD
But it certainly wasn't the way the music was intended .PERIOD
What that suggests is that ,COMMA even in the case of hearing loss ,COMMA the capacity for music remains .PERIOD
And here's a video of Joseph .PERIOD
Joseph :COLON I was born in 1986 .PERIOD
When I was 12 years old ,COMMA I was one of the first few people in Singapore who underwent cochlear implantation .PERIOD
And this is really unheard of stuff ,COMMA and this is all because of this technology .PERIOD
You don't actually have to hear it .PERIOD
I know he doesn't hear well ,COMMA because I've heard him do Karaoke .PERIOD
And so this idea has a lot of traction with us .PERIOD
And so ,COMMA I'm here to tell you ,COMMA you don't need a computer to actually have a spell .PERIOD In fact ,COMMA what you can do at the molecular level is that if you encode information -- you encode a spell or program as molecules -- then physics can actually directly interpret that information and run a program .PERIOD That's what happens in proteins .PERIOD
When this amino acid sequence gets pronounced as atoms ,COMMA these little letters are sticky for each other .PERIOD
So here's a shape .PERIOD I actually spent about a year in my home ,COMMA in my underwear ,COMMA coding ,COMMA like Linus [Torvalds] ,COMMA in that picture before .PERIOD
I mix them together ,COMMA add a little bit of salt water ,COMMA and then add this long strand I was telling you about ,COMMA that I've stolen from a virus .PERIOD And then what happens is ,COMMA you heat this whole thing up to about boiling .PERIOD You cool it down to room temperature ,COMMA and as you do ,COMMA what happens is those short strands ,COMMA they do the following thing :COLON each one of them binds that long strand in one place ,COMMA and then has a second half that binds that long strand in a distant place ,COMMA and brings those two parts of the long strand close together so that they stick together .PERIOD
You can make a molecule that looks like this ,COMMA and ,COMMA you know ,COMMA he likes to hang out with his buddies ,COMMA right .PERIOD
So that's DNA origami .PERIOD That's one way .PERIOD There are many ways of casting molecular spells using DNA .PERIOD
I did not choose to take up the pen ,COMMA the brush ,COMMA the camera .PERIOD
Why did I choose the gun as my instrument ?QUESTIONMARK

Why has violence decreased ?QUESTIONMARK
Or is there something else ?QUESTIONMARK
The armed forces implement the state monopoly on violence .PERIOD
My soldiers use the gun as an instrument of peace .PERIOD
And that is why -- and in The Netherlands ,COMMA we are very unique in that -- that is why the Dutch constitution states that one of the main tasks of the armed forces is to uphold and promote the international rule of law .PERIOD
And I hope that one day armies can be disbanded and humans will find a way of living together without violence and oppression .PERIOD
I hope you will support our soldiers when they are out there ,COMMA when they come home and when they are injured and need our care .PERIOD
You're climbing on little dimples and nubbins in the rock .PERIOD
Women are much more in balance because they don't have that idea that they're going to be able to do 100 pull-ups .PERIOD
They think about how to get the weight over their feet because it's sort of natural -- they carry you all day long .PERIOD
It took us 15 years to sequence HIV -- we sequenced SARS in 31 days .PERIOD
If you put different communication technologies on this logarithmic graph ,COMMA television ,COMMA radio ,COMMA telephone were adopted in decades .PERIOD
Now by the way ,COMMA if you look at this on a linear graph ,COMMA it looks like everything has just happened ,COMMA but some observer says ,COMMA Well ,COMMA Kurzweil just put points on this graph that fall on that straight line .PERIOD
And again ,COMMA it forms the same straight line .PERIOD You have a little bit of thickening in the line because people do have disagreements ,COMMA what the key points are ,COMMA there's differences of opinion when agriculture started ,COMMA or how long the Cambrian Explosion took .PERIOD
It took us three years to double our price performance of computing in 1900 ,COMMA two years in the middle ;SEMICOLON we're now doubling it every one year .PERIOD
Supercomputers -- same thing .PERIOD
You would think it would be a very erratic process ,COMMA and you have a very smooth outcome of this chaotic process .PERIOD
As we make them smaller and less expensive ,COMMA the electrons have less distance to travel .PERIOD
And economists have actually started worrying about that .PERIOD
This is due to greater productivity ,COMMA but the economist says ,COMMA But there's no way you're going to be able to keep up with that .PERIOD
These were evolved in very different times -- we'd like to actually change those programs .PERIOD
We'd like to actually turn that program off .PERIOD
Four or five pharmaceutical companies have noticed this ,COMMA felt that would be interesting drug for the human market ,COMMA and that's just one of the 30000 genes that affect our biochemistry .PERIOD
For example ,COMMA we can inhibit genes now with RNA interference .PERIOD
It's now under a 10 th of a cent .PERIOD
Once we understand its principles of operation ,COMMA and the pace with which we are reverse-engineering biology is accelerating ,COMMA we can actually design these things to be thousands of times more capable .PERIOD
Where will we get the software ?QUESTIONMARK
Wall Street noticed that this was a revolutionary technology ,COMMA which it was ,COMMA but then six months later ,COMMA when it hadn't revolutionized all business models ,COMMA they figured ,COMMA well ,COMMA that was wrong ,COMMA and then we had this bust .PERIOD
Images will be written directly to our retina ,COMMA providing full-immersion virtual reality ,COMMA augmented real reality .PERIOD We'll be interacting with virtual personalities .PERIOD
You can go there with other people ,COMMA have any kind of experience with anyone involving all of the senses .PERIOD
But most importantly ,COMMA it'll be a tremendous expansion of human intelligence through this direct merger with our technology ,COMMA which in some sense we're doing already .PERIOD
It's just like this one ,COMMA completely worthless ,COMMA in which it allegedly worked by electrostatic magnetic ion attraction ,COMMA which translates to pseudoscientific baloney -- would be the nice word -- in which you string together a bunch of words that sound good ,COMMA but it does absolutely nothing .PERIOD
In this case ,COMMA at trespass points ,COMMA allowing people to go through because your little tracker device said they were okay ,COMMA actually cost lives .PERIOD
And in fact ,COMMA I think my thesis here is that belief is the natural state of things .PERIOD
And that's called superstition ,COMMA and that ,COMMA I'm afraid ,COMMA we will always have with us .PERIOD
You are a hominid three million years ago walking on the plains of Africa .PERIOD

I still have -- or did I use the word still ?QUESTIONMARK I didn't mean that .PERIOD
These were just some of the things I've made .PERIOD
These are tiles .PERIOD The word ,COMMA playful is a necessary aspect of our work because ,COMMA actually ,COMMA one of our problems is that we have to make ,COMMA produce ,COMMA lovely things throughout all of life ,COMMA and this for me is now 75 years .PERIOD

I started as an apprentice to a Hungarian craftsman ,COMMA and this taught me what the guild system was in Middle Ages .PERIOD
We mashed the clay with our feet when it came from the hillside .PERIOD

I also got at the time a workbook which explained my rights and my working conditions ,COMMA and I still have that workbook .PERIOD
My mother thought that this was not very proper ,COMMA so she sat with us to add propriety to this activity .PERIOD
However ,COMMA the director ,COMMA the chemist ,COMMA model maker -- everybody -- concerned himself much more with the art department -- that means ,COMMA with my work -- than making toilets ,COMMA so finally they got a letter from the center ,COMMA from the bank who owned the factory ,COMMA saying ,COMMA make toilet-setting behind the art department ,COMMA and that was my end .PERIOD

But since I survived and I'm here ,COMMA and since this is the end of the five minutes ,COMMA I will -- Moderator :COLON Tell me when your last trip to Russia was .PERIOD
Oh ,COMMA this summer ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA the Lomonosov factory was bought by an American company ,COMMA invited me .PERIOD
That's my camera lens .PERIOD The first one -- the one I shot my Bob Dylan film with 35 years ago .PERIOD
I called my sister .PERIOD I called my neighbors .PERIOD I said ,COMMA Come dig .PERIOD
That's my sister .PERIOD She took care of pictures ,COMMA because I was a big collector of snapshot photography that I believed said a lot .PERIOD
She's still there .PERIOD She's there this morning ,COMMA actually .PERIOD
And we went into parenting expecting our lives to look like this .PERIOD
The nurse was coming at me with this beautiful ,COMMA beautiful child ,COMMA and I remember ,COMMA as she was approaching me ,COMMA the voices of friends saying ,COMMA The moment they put the baby in your hands ,COMMA you will feel a sense of love that will come over you that is [on] an order of magnitude more powerful than anything you've ever experienced in your entire life .PERIOD
And it was also ,COMMA of course ,COMMA surreal .PERIOD
You're either in love ,COMMA or you're not in love .PERIOD
I enjoyed being pregnant .PERIOD I loved it .PERIOD
Of those ,COMMA 67 percent are most lonely when their kids are zero to five -- probably really zero to two .PERIOD
In the process of preparing this ,COMMA we looked at how some other cultures around the world deal with this period of time ,COMMA because here in the Western world ,COMMA less than 50 percent of us live near our family members ,COMMA which I think is part of why this is such a tough period .PERIOD
The party line is that every single aspect of my life has just gotten dramatically better ever since I participated in the miracle that is childbirth and family .PERIOD
As you get older ,COMMA you become more stable .PERIOD
You start to realize that Hey ,COMMA I could go to this live music event and have an utterly transforming experience that will cover my entire body with goosebumps ,COMMA but it's more likely that I'll feel claustrophobic and I won't be able to get a beer .PERIOD
So your average happiness goes up ,COMMA but you lose those transcendent moments .PERIOD
But you realize you resubmit yourself to losing control in a really wonderful way ,COMMA which we think provides a lot of meaning to our lives and is quite gratifying .PERIOD
We trade the sort of security and safety of a certain level of contentment for these transcendent moments .PERIOD
So where does that leave the two of us as a family with our three little boys in the thick of all this ?QUESTIONMARK
There's another factor in our case .PERIOD
And we had reservations about this on the front end .PERIOD
Get out of the airplane ,COMMA it turns out you're trekking in Nepal .PERIOD
RG + AV :COLON Thank you .PERIOD
We crave to be in the room with the musician the day it was recorded ,COMMA the day it was played .PERIOD
And we go to live concerts ,COMMA and we get that as much as we can .PERIOD
And Yamaha makes an incredible thing called the Disklavier Pro that looks like a nice grand piano there .PERIOD
He just got tired of being in front of an audience ,COMMA and felt like -- a performing monkey was ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA his term .PERIOD
His maybe most famous recording was something called The Goldberg Variations .PERIOD
He wrote some early pieces ,COMMA but late in his life ,COMMA in his mature period ,COMMA he said ,COMMA Here's a theme -- 30 variations .PERIOD
And Gould recorded it in two major recordings that you may know about ,COMMA one in mono ,COMMA and one in stereo .PERIOD
What I'd like you to hear live is the 1955 version ,COMMA and we'll play the first couple pieces of it .PERIOD
So ,COMMA in the video world ,COMMA we've been able to invent ,COMMA in our lifetimes ,COMMA natural behavior .PERIOD
And when you put on headphones ,COMMA and you listen to this ,COMMA you're inside of Glenn Gould's body .PERIOD
Your eyes are pretty happy with some color and movement ,COMMA you know .PERIOD
You want to hear it in different rooms and whatever .PERIOD
We made a new recording of him playing in the Shrine Auditorium in September .PERIOD
And fortunately ,COMMA it's right in here .PERIOD
I want to start just by saying a bit about where I'm coming from .PERIOD
I trained briefly as a Buddhist monk under this guy .PERIOD
And although that was great for the music business at the time ,COMMA it wasn't much good for anything else .PERIOD
Unprecedented wealth and prosperity ,COMMA but that growth hasn't always delivered what we needed .PERIOD
Rates of depression carried on up ,COMMA right across the Western world .PERIOD
They bring ideas from the margins into the mainstream .PERIOD
Ronald Reagan ,COMMA again ,COMMA said the two funniest sentences in the English language are ,COMMA I'm from the government .PERIOD And I'm here to help .PERIOD
And I think more and more people are also asking :COLON Why boost consumption ,COMMA rather than change what we consume ?QUESTIONMARK
It's not that our scientists are necessarily much smarter than they were a hundred years ago ,COMMA maybe they are ,COMMA but they have a hell of a lot more backing than they ever did .PERIOD
And he believed we live with others ,COMMA we share the world with others and therefore our innovation must be done with others too ,COMMA not doing things at people ,COMMA for them ,COMMA and so on .PERIOD
Others are much more pragmatic :COLON health coaches ,COMMA learning mentors ,COMMA job clubs .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA the idea that all of this represents ,COMMA I think ,COMMA is rapidly becoming a common sense and part of how we respond to the crisis ,COMMA recognizing the need to invest in innovation for social progress as well as technological progress .PERIOD
There were big health innovation funds launched earlier this year in this country ,COMMA as well as a public service innovation lab .PERIOD
And if ,COMMA a generation or two ago ,COMMA the big challenges were ones like getting a man on the moon ,COMMA perhaps the challenges we need to set ourselves now are ones like eliminating child malnutrition ,COMMA stopping trafficking ,COMMA or one ,COMMA I think closer to home for America or Europe ,COMMA why don't we set ourselves the goal of achieving a billion extra years of life for today's citizens .PERIOD
Now those are all goals which could be achieved within a decade ,COMMA but only with radical and systematic experiment ,COMMA not just with technologies ,COMMA but also with lifestyles and culture and policies and institutions too .PERIOD
History was over and society would inevitably have to take second place to economy .PERIOD
Just as today ,COMMA the enthusiasts of unrestrained capitalism say it's rooted in human nature ,COMMA only now it's individualism ,COMMA inquisitiveness ,COMMA and so on .PERIOD
You think I've lost my way ,COMMA and somebody's going to come on the stage in a minute and guide me gently back to my seat .PERIOD
I want to tell you about my friend who was teaching English to adults in Abu Dhabi .PERIOD
And one fine day ,COMMA she decided to take them into the garden to teach them some nature vocabulary .PERIOD
A language dies every 14 days .PERIOD
That is a little bit too early .PERIOD
We were brought to teach English because the government wanted to modernize the country and to empower the citizens through education .PERIOD
But if you're not a native speaker ,COMMA you have to pass a test .PERIOD
Do we really want to end up with 600 languages and the main one being English ,COMMA or Chinese ?QUESTIONMARK
And I want to remind you that the giants upon whose shoulders today's intelligentsia stand did not have to have English ,COMMA they didn't have to pass an English test .PERIOD
Let me tell you a story about two scientists ,COMMA two English scientists .PERIOD
So he invented a cost-free solar lamp .PERIOD
When he received his award ,COMMA he said these lovely words :COLON The children can lead Africa from what it is today ,COMMA a dark continent ,COMMA to a light continent .PERIOD
I am known best for human-powered flight ,COMMA but that was just one thing that got me going in the sort of things that I'm working in now .PERIOD
And we thought a solar-powered plane wouldn't really make sense ,COMMA but you could do it and it would get a lot of publicity for solar power and maybe help that field .PERIOD
You don't need to dig down for these chemicals ,COMMA and we can do things much more efficiently .PERIOD
So this just summarizes it .PERIOD Over billions of years ,COMMA on a unique sphere ,COMMA chance has painted a thin covering of life -- complex and probable ,COMMA wonderful and fragile .PERIOD
Suddenly ,COMMA we humans ,COMMA a recently arrived species ,COMMA no longer subject to the checks and balances inherent in nature ,COMMA have grown in population ,COMMA technology and intelligence to a position of terrible power .PERIOD We ,COMMA now ,COMMA wield the paintbrush .PERIOD
Okay ,COMMA and let's have the next .PERIOD
And then also ,COMMA like it said in the video ,COMMA you can turn it left or right just by putting the lift under one wing or another .PERIOD
And that's it ,COMMA yeah ,COMMA just a few inventions .PERIOD
Most of the talks that you've heard in the last several fabulous days have been from people who have the characteristic that they have thought about something ,COMMA they are experts ,COMMA they know what's going on .PERIOD
All of you know about the topic that I'm supposed to talk about .PERIOD
Well ,COMMA it enables you to drink coffee .PERIOD
And the other ,COMMA of course ,COMMA is a birth control pill ,COMMA which ,COMMA in a very simple way ,COMMA fundamentally changed the structure of society by changing the role of women in it by providing to them the opportunity to make reproductive choices .PERIOD
It's like ,COMMA what is simplicity ?QUESTIONMARK
What is the state of science ?QUESTIONMARK
And ,COMMA interestingly ,COMMA complexity is very highly evolved .PERIOD
One of the things I want to do is to help you with a very important task -- which you may not know that you have very often -- which is to understand how to sit next to a physicist at a dinner party and have a conversation .PERIOD
And the words that I would like you to focus on are complexity and emergence ,COMMA because these will enable you to start the conversation and then daydream about other things .PERIOD
And that's complexity .PERIOD
All right ,COMMA so let me give you an example of simplicity of a particular kind .PERIOD
The question is :COLON Why is binary simpler than Arabic ?QUESTIONMARK
And this is a map of bitflows across the continent .PERIOD
That is ,COMMA you can stack them .PERIOD
And you put a drop ,COMMA in this case ,COMMA of urine at the bottom .PERIOD
It turns colors .PERIOD In this particular case ,COMMA you're reading kidney function .PERIOD
If you take too much out of something that's simple ,COMMA you lose function .PERIOD
So you can't make it too simple .PERIOD
And the second is a design issue ,COMMA and it's not directly relevant ,COMMA but it's a nice statement .PERIOD
So ,COMMA what I think one can begin to do with this kind of cut at the word simplicity ,COMMA which doesn't cover Brancusi ,COMMA it doesn't answer the question of why Mondrian is better or worse or simpler or less simpler than Van Gogh ,COMMA and certainly doesn't address the question of whether Mozart is simpler than Bach .PERIOD
You've got a company set up to .PERIOD
I want to open by quoting Einstein's wonderful statement ,COMMA just so people will feel at ease that the great scientist of the 20 th century also agrees with us ,COMMA and also calls us to this action .PERIOD
I know the next Buddha will come a few thousand years from now ,COMMA but exists currently in a certain heaven -- that's Maitreya -- so ,COMMA I'm going to go on a retreat and I'm going to meditate and pray until the Buddha Maitreya reveals himself to me ,COMMA and gives me a teaching or something to revive the practice of compassion in the world today .PERIOD
And the man said ,COMMA Really ?QUESTIONMARK And he showed him a dish full of needles .PERIOD
So he said ,COMMA Okay ,COMMA I get the point .PERIOD
He went back to his cave .PERIOD He meditated again .PERIOD
Another three years ,COMMA no vision .PERIOD He leaves again .PERIOD
So he thought ,COMMA I will take the maggots and put them on this piece of flesh ,COMMA then clean the dog's wounds ,COMMA and then I'll figure out what to do with the maggots .PERIOD
So he starts to do that .PERIOD He can't grab the maggots .PERIOD
He jumps back and there ,COMMA of course ,COMMA is the future Buddha Maitreya in a beautiful vision -- rainbow lights ,COMMA golden ,COMMA jeweled ,COMMA a plasma body ,COMMA an exquisite mystic vision -- that he sees .PERIOD
So as he comes up from his first bow he says ,COMMA My Lord ,COMMA I'm so happy to see you ,COMMA but where have you been for 12 years ?QUESTIONMARK
And Maitreya says ,COMMA I was with you .PERIOD Who do you think was making needles and making nests and dripping on rocks for you ,COMMA mister dense ?QUESTIONMARK
Looking for the Buddha in person ,COMMA he said .PERIOD
So ,COMMA naturally ,COMMA they chased him out of town .PERIOD
You gave me that expression ;SEMICOLON the eternal mama ,COMMA you said .PERIOD That's wonderful .PERIOD
So ,COMMA they first create this foundation of equality .PERIOD
And we don't hate anyone ,COMMA therefore .PERIOD So we equalize .PERIOD That's very important .PERIOD
And this is the way you do it .PERIOD You take any being who looks weird to you ,COMMA and you see how they could be familiar to you .PERIOD
You reduce the feeling of otherness about beings .PERIOD
And then you connect that with your feeling that everyone has that motherly possibility .PERIOD
And they ,COMMA then ,COMMA never get any positive feedback .PERIOD
Compassion makes you happy .PERIOD
The first person who is happy when you get great compassion is yourself ,COMMA even if you haven't done anything yet for anybody else .PERIOD
Because traditional economic theory would say ,COMMA well ,COMMA the mountain bike was probably invented by some big bike corporation that had a big R&ampD lab where they were thinking up new projects ,COMMA and it came out of there .PERIOD It didn't come from there .PERIOD
The ideas are coming back from the consumers ,COMMA and they're often ahead of the producers .PERIOD
The very first landline telephones ,COMMA the inventors thought that they would be used for people to listen in to live performances from West End theaters .PERIOD
More and more ,COMMA the inventors of things will not be able to say that in advance .PERIOD
The second reason why users are more and more important is that they are the source of big ,COMMA disruptive innovations .PERIOD
Take astronomy as an example ,COMMA which Yochai has already mentioned .PERIOD
What does this mean ,COMMA then ,COMMA for our organizational landscape ?QUESTIONMARK
Let me just give you two examples .PERIOD
Which venture capitalist in their right mind is going to give you any money to set up a venture competing with Microsoft ,COMMA with Microsoft Outlook ?QUESTIONMARK No one .PERIOD
Because the professionals ,COMMA over here in these closed organizations -- they might be academics ;SEMICOLON they might be programmers ;SEMICOLON they might be doctors ;SEMICOLON they might be journalists -- my former profession -- say ,COMMA No ,COMMA no -- you can't trust these people over here .PERIOD
They want to ,COMMA as Jimmy said ,COMMA they want to have a dialogue ,COMMA a conversation .PERIOD
What should be the role of public policy ?QUESTIONMARK
And I was having dinner with this guy called Timothy Chan .PERIOD
Didn't go into the Internet ,COMMA kept his money ,COMMA decided to go into computer games .PERIOD
At any one time ,COMMA there are four million people playing one of his games .PERIOD
How many people does he employ to service that population ?QUESTIONMARK
Well ,COMMA how can he service 250 million people from 500 employees ?QUESTIONMARK
Imagine you could take all the children in education in Britain ,COMMA and one percent of them were co-developers of education .PERIOD
Or if you got one percent of the patients in the NHS to ,COMMA in some sense ,COMMA be co-producers of health .PERIOD
For example ,COMMA I get people to dress up their vacuum cleaners .PERIOD
And I figured I'd put it on the Internet for all employees under stress to help you better deal with what you're going through on your job .PERIOD
And so I said ,COMMA Let's put this together in an album .PERIOD
We can build all sorts of environments to make it a little bit easier ,COMMA but ultimately ,COMMA what we're trying to do is really connect with one other person .PERIOD
Recording :COLON Okay ,COMMA here's something .PERIOD
But sometimes I feel really lonely .PERIOD
Like even people in convenience stores saying ,COMMA Have a nice day ,COMMA when they're accidentally looking me in the eye .PERIOD
And I got a lot ,COMMA like 30 in a half an hour .PERIOD
I was like ,COMMA I don't know .PERIOD
But anyway ,COMMA this same person ,COMMA Laura ,COMMA ended up emailing me a little bit after that project .PERIOD
So I asked her ,COMMA What does it feel like when you feel this way ?QUESTIONMARK
I said ,COMMA Okay ,COMMA I'll think about it .PERIOD
And when you put them together ,COMMA something magical happens ,COMMA something absolutely incredible happens ,COMMA and all of a sudden I get a chorus from around the world .PERIOD
And over the past 35 years ,COMMA I've studied behavior on the basis of everything from genes through neurotransmitters ,COMMA dopamine ,COMMA things like that ,COMMA all the way through circuit analysis .PERIOD
It's really a very precisely timed thing .PERIOD
So there is the pattern that every one of them had ,COMMA but they all were a little different too .PERIOD
A key thing is that the major violence genes ,COMMA it's called the MAO-A gene .PERIOD
It's on the X chromosome .PERIOD And so in this way you can only get it from your mother .PERIOD
And what I think might happen in these areas of the world ,COMMA where we have constant violence ,COMMA you end up having generations of kids that are seeing all this violence .PERIOD
Now I said ,COMMA Okay ,COMMA so what ?QUESTIONMARK We have Lizzie .PERIOD
But it doesn't stop there .PERIOD
But there's gonna be bad news somewhere .PERIOD
It's the biggest scientific experiment ever attempted .PERIOD
So ,COMMA you might be asking ,COMMA Why ?QUESTIONMARK
Absolutely everything .PERIOD
Actually ,COMMA if you just look at your thumbnail -- about a square centimeter -- there are something like 60 billion neutrinos per second from the sun ,COMMA passing through every square centimeter of your body .PERIOD
And these particles have been discovered over the last century ,COMMA pretty much .PERIOD
One of the wonderful things ,COMMA actually ,COMMA I find ,COMMA is that we've discovered any of them ,COMMA when you realize how tiny they are .PERIOD
So ,COMMA one of my most illustrious forebears at Manchester University ,COMMA Ernest Rutherford ,COMMA discoverer of the atomic nucleus ,COMMA once said ,COMMA All science is either physics or stamp collecting .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA I don't think he meant to insult the rest of science ,COMMA although he was from New Zealand ,COMMA so it's possible .PERIOD
But imagine someone who's not very popular moves through the room .PERIOD
The picture is that the electrons and the quarks in your body and in the universe that we see around us are heavy ,COMMA in a sense ,COMMA and massive ,COMMA because they're surrounded by Higgs particles .PERIOD
This is a creation story ,COMMA I think ,COMMA equally as wonderful .PERIOD
So that's the LHC .PERIOD
When I grew up and realized that science fiction was not a good source for superpowers ,COMMA I decided instead to embark on a journey of real science ,COMMA to find a more useful truth .PERIOD
By measuring their student smiles ,COMMA researchers were able to predict how fulfilling and long-lasting a subject's marriage will be ,COMMA how well she would score on standardized tests of well-being and how inspiring she would be to others .PERIOD
Outside of this room ,COMMA more than a third of us smile more than 20 times per day ,COMMA whereas less than 14 percent of us smile less than five .PERIOD
The finding supported Darwin's theory by showing that facial feedback modifies the neural processing of emotional content in the brain in a way that helps us feel better when we smile .PERIOD
It is a user-appropriate technology that has been used for humanitarian good to great effect .PERIOD
The grassroots has been strengthened through the social power of sharing and they are challenging the old models ,COMMA the old analog models of control and command .PERIOD
If you were to arrive in Nairobi today and pick up a tourist map ,COMMA Kibera is represented as a lush ,COMMA green national park devoid of human settlement .PERIOD
They're normally backroom or basement hardware service providers ,COMMA but they need to be elevated to software strategists .PERIOD
But if you're like me ,COMMA my humanity is more like a window .PERIOD
Then suddenly I see it ,COMMA and usually ,COMMA it's never good .PERIOD
My mother was English .PERIOD
She was five foot two ,COMMA very feisty and very English .PERIOD
This is how English my mother is -- or was ,COMMA she just passed .PERIOD
And then we went to a fish restaurant ,COMMA and we had Chad ,COMMA the surfer dude ,COMMA serving us ,COMMA and he came up and my mother said ,COMMA Do you have any specials ,COMMA young man ?QUESTIONMARK
And my mother turned to me and said ,COMMA What language is he speaking ?QUESTIONMARK
But her Igbo wasn't too good .PERIOD
So ,COMMA here are these women ,COMMA who never discuss their period with their husbands ,COMMA and here I am telling them ,COMMA Well ,COMMA how often do you get your period ?QUESTIONMARK
It was my mother with five little children .PERIOD
Can you imagine this five-foot-two woman ,COMMA standing up to men with guns who want to kill us ?QUESTIONMARK
And she said ,COMMA You know ,COMMA you can steel your heart against any kind of trouble ,COMMA any kind of horror .PERIOD
And then the next planting season ,COMMA when they sang the dirge ,COMMA they would remove as many names of the dead that equaled as many people that were born .PERIOD
Which would seem to suggest that apartheid was entirely the business of men .PERIOD
Their humanity never seems to matter very much to us .PERIOD
And a lot of rituals involved killing ,COMMA killing little animals ,COMMA progressing along ,COMMA so when I turned 13 -- and ,COMMA I mean ,COMMA it made sense ,COMMA it was an agrarian community ,COMMA somebody had to kill the animals ,COMMA there was no Whole Foods you could go and get kangaroo steak at -- so when I turned 13 ,COMMA it was my turn now to kill a goat .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA when I was growing up ,COMMA he used to tell me stories about how he used to bayonet people ,COMMA and their intestines would fall out ,COMMA but they would keep running .PERIOD
But he was desperate to show that he'd just come back ,COMMA so he summoned me up ,COMMA and he said ,COMMA Go into the bedroom ,COMMA my bedroom .PERIOD
That's basically how this thing operates .PERIOD
So one of the advantages of this design is ,COMMA when you scale things down ,COMMA the robot naturally becomes agile .PERIOD
It's inversely proportional to R .PERIOD
No matter how you throw it ,COMMA the robot recovers and comes back to him .PERIOD
So here are robots carrying beams ,COMMA columns and assembling cube-like structures .PERIOD
So you might want to have multiple robots carry payloads .PERIOD
So we use a little trick .PERIOD
They sense their neighbors .PERIOD
So again the robots monitor this error and calculate the control commands 100 times a second ,COMMA which then translates to the motor commands 600 times a second .PERIOD
As you can see here ,COMMA they collapse from a three-dimensional formation into planar formation .PERIOD
Another application I want to show you -- again ,COMMA this is in our lab .PERIOD
So his algorithm essentially tells these robots how to autonomously build cubic structures from truss-like elements .PERIOD
So all these experiments you've seen thus far ,COMMA all these demonstrations ,COMMA have been done with the help of motion capture systems .PERIOD
It figures out where it is with respect to the features and then estimates its position 100 times a second allowing us to use the control algorithms that I described to you earlier .PERIOD
You will see nine robots play six different instruments .PERIOD
Let's watch .PERIOD
Unless you're on one of these Californian low-carb diets ,COMMA bread is standard .PERIOD
And I think it is because we feel that this kind of bread really is about authenticity .PERIOD
And this is about good taste ,COMMA good traditions .PERIOD
But we have ,COMMA somehow ,COMMA in the course of the last few centuries ,COMMA or even decades ,COMMA started to cultivate an image of a mythical ,COMMA rural agricultural past .PERIOD
So what is happening ?QUESTIONMARK
Bread has migrated to tropical countries ,COMMA where the middle classes now eat French rolls and hamburgers and where the commuters find bread much more handy to use than rice or cassava .PERIOD
This is where it all comes from ,COMMA and where these farmers who actually ,COMMA ten thousand years ago ,COMMA put us on the road of bread .PERIOD
Let's go back to traditional farming .PERIOD
And I'm making a real plea here .PERIOD
We've moved towards large-scale and very high control .PERIOD
What I want us to do is to keep up the science and even get more science in there but go to a kind of regional scale -- not just in terms of the scale of the fields ,COMMA but in terms of the entire food network .PERIOD
So what kind of science can we have ?QUESTIONMARK
We cannot solve the world food problem by using biological agriculture .PERIOD
Everything is linked together .PERIOD
Understand that you are part of this enormous chain of events .PERIOD
And as you eat it ,COMMA and as you try it -- please come and stand up .PERIOD
Every meal you eat contains ingredients from all across the world .PERIOD
And that ,COMMA I think ,COMMA evolutionarily-speaking is unique .PERIOD
And today is a time for me to talk to you about water .PERIOD
This crocodile ,COMMA which grows to almost 20 feet long in the northern rivers ,COMMA and this charismatic snake ,COMMA the king cobra .PERIOD
And it really works to start with them .PERIOD
The people of this part of India worship the king cobra .PERIOD
It's just a wresting match ,COMMA but a remarkable activity .PERIOD
And now the king cobra is a new one .PERIOD
It survived even during the time that the dinosaurs died off .PERIOD
In fact ,COMMA if you see the map ,COMMA the range of their original habitat was all the way from the Indus in Pakistan to the Irrawaddy in Burma .PERIOD
And pretty soon we were seeing sights like this .PERIOD
This was actually just taken last year .PERIOD
My pals in the Crocodile Specialist Group of the IUCN ,COMMA the [Madras Crocodile Bank] ,COMMA an NGO ,COMMA the World Wildlife Fund ,COMMA the Wildlife Institute of India ,COMMA State Forest Departments ,COMMA and the Ministry of Environment ,COMMA we all work together on stuff .PERIOD
So ,COMMA it seemed that the toxin that was killing the gharial was something in the food chain ,COMMA something in the fish they were eating .PERIOD
But Poolan Devi was one [of them] .PERIOD Which actually Shekhar Kapur made an incredible movie ,COMMA The Bandit Queen ,COMMA which I urge you to see .PERIOD
So ,COMMA who is next ?QUESTIONMARK Us ?QUESTIONMARK
We've got a lot of a good team of people working up there .PERIOD
So ,COMMA we can do it .PERIOD
And there is a gharial looking at us from the river .PERIOD
Namaste .PERIOD
I look at it as a creature who is totally frightened of something so dangerous as a human being .PERIOD
You were saying that that hasn't been filmed before .PERIOD
And the guy who is working there with them ,COMMA he's from Maharashtra ,COMMA he said ,COMMA I think he's after the nusha .PERIOD
Whenever he eats the pit viper he gets this little venom rush .PERIOD
To me ,COMMA that’s the real natural wonder .PERIOD
And the insurance companies found that they began to save almost 30000 dollars per patient ,COMMA and Medicare is now in the middle of doing a demonstration project where they’re paying for 1800 people to go through the program on the sites that we train .PERIOD
And I’ll talk more about this ,COMMA but the real epidemic isn’t just heart disease or obesity or smoking -- it’s loneliness and depression .PERIOD
And the pain is not the problem :COLON it’s the symptom .PERIOD
What was the biggest selling drug of all time when it was introduced a few years ago ?QUESTIONMARK
So the very behaviors that we think of as being so sexy in our culture are the very ones that leave so many people feeling tired ,COMMA lethargic ,COMMA depressed and impotent ,COMMA and that’s not much fun .PERIOD
Your sexual function improves .PERIOD
When you eat a big fatty meal ,COMMA how do you feel ?QUESTIONMARK
You feel kind of sleepy afterwards .PERIOD
These are not election returns ;SEMICOLON these are the percentage of people who are overweight .PERIOD
He says ,COMMA I’ve got some good news .PERIOD
What we found was that ,COMMA after a year ,COMMA none of the experimental group patients who made these lifestyle changes needed treatment ,COMMA whereas six of the control-group patients needed surgery or radiation .PERIOD
And then I wondered :COLON was there any relationship between how much people changed their diet and lifestyle -- whichever group they were in -- and the changes in PSA ?QUESTIONMARK
The last thing I want to talk about ,COMMA apropos of the issue of the pursuit of happiness ,COMMA is that study after study have shown that people who are lonely and depressed -- and depression is the other real epidemic in our culture -- are many times more likely to get sick and die prematurely ,COMMA in part because ,COMMA as we talked about ,COMMA they’re more likely to smoke and overeat and drink too much and work too hard and so on .PERIOD
It can be sexual intimacy – I happen to think that healing energy and erotic energy are just different forms of the same thing .PERIOD
And at the end of it ,COMMA somebody said ,COMMA Hey ,COMMA Swami ,COMMA what’s the difference between wellness and illness ?QUESTIONMARK
And so he went up on the board and he wrote the word illness ,COMMA and circled the first letter ,COMMA and then wrote the word wellness ,COMMA and circled the first two letters .PERIOD
And along the way they created a breakthrough in computer visualization .PERIOD
Hopefully it won't stutter .PERIOD
And if we did our jobs well ,COMMA you won't know that we were even involved .PERIOD
some you could see ,COMMA some you couldn't .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA there's no use of prosthetic makeup or photography of Brad superimposed over another actor's body .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA Fincher is an interesting guy .PERIOD
And so David had an interesting take on the film ,COMMA and he threw a challenge at us .PERIOD
We went through a process of elimination and a process of discovery with David ,COMMA and we ruled out ,COMMA of course ,COMMA swapping actors .PERIOD
But we used lots of cheats and shortcuts .PERIOD
We really felt like we were in a -- kind of a 12 -step program .PERIOD
And of course ,COMMA the first step is :COLON admit you've got a problem .PERIOD
So we needed a system that would allow Benjamin to do everything a human being can do .PERIOD
And we realized that there was a giant chasm between the state of the art of technology in 2004 and where we needed it to be .PERIOD
The state of the art at the time was something called marker-based motion capture .PERIOD
But we also looked at numbers of other films at the time that were using facial marker tracking ,COMMA and that's the idea of putting markers on the human face and doing the same process .PERIOD
We needed the subtleties of the skin .PERIOD
We needed creases and dimples and wrinkles and all of those things .PERIOD
So ,COMMA clearly ,COMMA we were in a substantially better place for this .PERIOD
We measure complexity and fidelity of data in terms of polygonal count .PERIOD
This was the breakthrough .PERIOD
This is Brad doing one of the Ekman FACS poses .PERIOD
We shot him with four HD cameras so we'd get multiple views of him and then David would choose the take of Brad being Benjamin that he thought best matched the footage with the rest of the cast .PERIOD
And here you can see the body actor .PERIOD
We also had to create an eye system .PERIOD
He was very popular .PERIOD
There were no animators necessary to come in and interpret behavior or enhance his performance .PERIOD
So ,COMMA as things went through this process ,COMMA Fincher would always say ,COMMA It sandblasts the edges off of the performance .PERIOD
So it sees a smile as a smile .PERIOD
But we ended up calling the entire process and all the technology emotion capture ,COMMA as opposed to just motion capture .PERIOD
Their teeth are basically bashed out with a metal rod .PERIOD
And we said ,COMMA Okay ,COMMA here is some seed fund .PERIOD
The women were just not allowed to come out of the community and work with mainstream society .PERIOD So ,COMMA we were able to address that .PERIOD
We rescued over 550 dancing bears .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA the end product of that action is up on the board here .PERIOD
When I started talking to Richard about what I was going to speak about ,COMMA I had recently come back from Jordan ,COMMA where I had an amazing experience with a camel .PERIOD
The guys got out ,COMMA they put the hood up ,COMMA they started working under the hood ,COMMA got it going again .PERIOD About a hundred yards ,COMMA it broke down .PERIOD
And they said ,COMMA Ah ,COMMA no problem !EXCLAMATIONMARK We just get out and walk .PERIOD
And they said ,COMMA Yeah ,COMMA yeah ,COMMA we'll walk .PERIOD We'll find some camels .PERIOD
So we'll need to be very careful around him .PERIOD Don't let him get you .PERIOD
When they're in rut -- they're similar to seals in the way ,COMMA like ,COMMA a seal has to open its nose to breathe .PERIOD
They use them to pinpoint sound .PERIOD
The desert's extremely windy as well as being very cold .PERIOD
But they use their tails a lot ,COMMA especially in rut .PERIOD
But on this particular occasion ,COMMA it was very ,COMMA very clear that as horny as Suki was ,COMMA Jasmine was having none of it .PERIOD
So I'm going to show you another film .PERIOD
But before I do ,COMMA I just want to mention that this animal truly is a sort of the SUV of the sand ,COMMA the ship of the desert .PERIOD It's so vital to the inhabitants of the areas in which the camel is found -- largely Mongolia and Sahara -- that there are 160 words in Arabic to describe the camel .PERIOD
And if this is a creature that was designed by committee ,COMMA it's certainly been like no committee I've ever been on .PERIOD
So here's what Suki would do in search of a mate .PERIOD
I'm TED Camel .PERIOD
I'm smartly designed .PERIOD
A distinguished nose ,COMMA with nostrils lined to filter out sand and dust ,COMMA and a groove that catches moisture .PERIOD
Leathery chest pads that beat the heat .PERIOD
I'm able to lose 40 percent of my weight without dying .PERIOD
Humans -- the animal -- are pretty lucky creatures because ,COMMA by and large ,COMMA we really don't have to adapt to our environment ;SEMICOLON we adapt our environment to us .PERIOD
But this creature that you've just seen ultimately adapts ,COMMA and keeps adapting and adapting .PERIOD
And the idea was to have me record some of my poems and then they would find animators to animate them .PERIOD
Writing is not actually as easy as that for me .PERIOD
Poetry just says a few things in different ways .PERIOD
Some days I put the people in their places at the table ,COMMA bend their legs at the knees ,COMMA if they come with that feature ,COMMA and fix them into the tiny wooden chairs .PERIOD
The name of the author is the first to go ,COMMA followed obediently by the title ,COMMA the plot ,COMMA the heartbreaking conclusion ,COMMA the entire novel ,COMMA which suddenly becomes one you have never read ,COMMA never even heard of .PERIOD
It's called The Country .PERIOD
And that to me was a bad start to the afterlife ,COMMA having to witness your own funeral and feel gratified .PERIOD
If it has a subject ,COMMA the subject is adolescence .PERIOD
Frankly ,COMMA who cares if Annie Oakley was a crack shot at 15 or if Maria Callas debuted as Tosca at 17 ?QUESTIONMARK
And here comes a second follower .PERIOD
Now it's not a lone nut ,COMMA it's not two nuts -- three is a crowd ,COMMA and a crowd is news .PERIOD
I was listening to all the experts and talking to sort of a board of medical advisers .PERIOD
I wrote the book on a treadmill ,COMMA and it took me about a thousand miles to write the book .PERIOD
I also tried to be the safest person I could be ,COMMA because that's a part of health .PERIOD
Now it's a little extreme ,COMMA I admit .PERIOD
But if you think about this ,COMMA this is actually -- the Freakonomics authors wrote about this -- that more people die on a per mile basis from drunk walking than from drunk driving .PERIOD
Without the sex part .PERIOD
And I finally have stabilized .PERIOD
And I ,COMMA of course ,COMMA don't have time to go into all of them .PERIOD
It really impairs cognition .PERIOD
So without noise reduction technology ,COMMA our country would not exist .PERIOD
And you can almost trick yourself into thinking you're eating Doritos .PERIOD
That's my greatest hope .PERIOD
What might they find ?QUESTIONMARK
Here's a replica of one such seal .PERIOD
We need to decipher the script to answer that question .PERIOD
In fact ,COMMA the script has become a battleground of sorts between three different groups of people .PERIOD
If you look at a map of India today ,COMMA you'll see that most of the languages spoken in North India belong to the Indo-European language family .PERIOD
First ,COMMA there's no Rosetta Stone .PERIOD
And furthermore ,COMMA we don't even know what language they spoke .PERIOD
And to make matters even worse ,COMMA most of the text that we have are extremely short .PERIOD
And why was I fascinated ?QUESTIONMARK
And I'd like to describe some of the results that we have found .PERIOD
I'll give you a couple of seconds .PERIOD
Languages contain patterns .PERIOD
Language ,COMMA on the other hand ,COMMA has an intermediate level of entropy ;SEMICOLON it's neither too rigid ,COMMA nor is it too random .PERIOD
Here's a graph that plots the entropies of a whole bunch of sequences .PERIOD
We found that the Indus script actually falls within the range of the linguistic scripts .PERIOD
Who'd have thought that deciphering could be a dangerous profession ?QUESTIONMARK
So ,COMMA as the old saying goes ,COMMA if it looks like a linguistic script and it acts like a linguistic script ,COMMA then perhaps we may have a linguistic script on our hands .PERIOD
So as an example ,COMMA here's a word .PERIOD
Okay .PERIOD Great .PERIOD
So this is just like a crossword puzzle ,COMMA except that this is the mother of all crossword puzzles because the stakes are so high if you solve it .PERIOD
It contains seven vertical strokes followed by this fish-like sign .PERIOD
And it turns out that in India there's a long tradition of names being based on horoscopes and star constellations present at the time of birth .PERIOD
Similarly ,COMMA there's another sequence of six stars ,COMMA and that translates to aru meen ,COMMA which is the old Dravidian name for the star constellation Pleiades .PERIOD
So that was pretty exciting .PERIOD
But whilst we have an overwhelmingly vivid visual understanding of space ,COMMA we have no sense of what space sounds like .PERIOD
Now this story doesn't start with vast telescopes or futuristic spacecraft ,COMMA but a rather more humble technology -- and in fact ,COMMA the very medium which gave us the telecommunications revolution that we're all part of today :COLON the telephone .PERIOD
Thomas Watson spent hours listening to the strange crackles and hisses and chirps and whistles that his accidental antenna detected .PERIOD
They turned out to be lightning or sources of electrical power .PERIOD
There was a glitch in their soundtrack .PERIOD
We do enjoy our misery in a certain way .PERIOD
Because our egocentric perception -- from the Buddha's point of view ,COMMA misperception -- is that all we are is what is inside our skin .PERIOD
And everyone here is unfortunately carrying that habitual perception ,COMMA a little bit ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK
Like ,COMMA even when you're having a good time ,COMMA when is the good time over ?QUESTIONMARK
I think the Dalai Lama should have heard that .PERIOD I wish he'd been there to hear that .PERIOD
Everybody has the wrong idea .PERIOD They think Buddha was so boring ,COMMA and they're so surprised when they meet Dalai Lama and he's fairly jolly .PERIOD
The human being is almost out of time .PERIOD
This is Birhan ,COMMA who was the Ethiopian girl who launched Live Aid in the 1980 s ,COMMA 15 minutes away from death when she was rescued ,COMMA and that picture of her being rescued is one that went round the world .PERIOD
And what do all these pictures and events have in common ?QUESTIONMARK
What they have in common is what we see unlocks what we cannot see .PERIOD
What we see unlocks the invisible ties and bonds of sympathy that bring us together to become a human community .PERIOD
Go back 200 years when the slave trade was under pressure from William Wilberforce and all the protesters .PERIOD
They won public opinion over a long period of time .PERIOD
What could they have done with the pictures that they could have shown if they were able to use the modern means of communication to win people’s hearts and minds ?QUESTIONMARK
I was with Nelson Mandela a year ago ,COMMA when he was in London .PERIOD
I have just been talking to the President of Sierra Leone .PERIOD
I met her in a field ,COMMA she was ragged ,COMMA she had no shoes .PERIOD
We must then build a proper relationship between the richest and the poorest countries based on our desire that they are able to fend for themselves with the investment that is necessary in their agriculture ,COMMA so that Africa is not a net importer of food ,COMMA but an exporter of food .PERIOD
Making people laugh .PERIOD
So please send me your ideas about how to design a foot .PERIOD
We have to first know what a foot is .PERIOD
And I want you to help me do that in this next clip .PERIOD
See any common themes ?QUESTIONMARK Principles ?QUESTIONMARK
Now it turns out that animals can go anywhere .PERIOD
If you want to study how a foot works ,COMMA we're going to have to simulate those surfaces ,COMMA or simulate that debris .PERIOD
Without a foot ,COMMA here's what it does .PERIOD It doesn't even slow down .PERIOD
That's a bipedal octopus that's disguised as a rolling coconut .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA you might have noticed something else about the animals when they were running over the rough terrain .PERIOD
Boy :COLON Spiny .PERIOD
Do we really understand that principle of tuning ?QUESTIONMARK The answer is ,COMMA yes !EXCLAMATIONMARK
But look at this animal do it !EXCLAMATIONMARK
And you probably feel them if you grabbed it .PERIOD
These are all from different insects .PERIOD
Let's look at that ant .PERIOD
You see what happens ?QUESTIONMARK
So to our blueprint ,COMMA we stick on some sticky pads .PERIOD
These are its feet .PERIOD
It has a hundred to a thousand split ends ,COMMA and that's the secret ,COMMA because it allows intimate contact .PERIOD
Here you are ,COMMA pulling off the Band-Aid .PERIOD
Here's the new project :COLON we're trying to create the first climbing search-and-rescue robot -- no suction or magnets -- that can only move on limited kinds of surfaces .PERIOD
And here it is coming up at you ,COMMA in its first steps up a wall .PERIOD
And that's exactly what he's done .PERIOD
Thank you .PERIOD
The first thing that got me interested in the sounds of these underwater animals ,COMMA whose world was so foreign to me ,COMMA was evidence from captive dolphins that captive dolphins could imitate human sounds .PERIOD
This is a picture of a trainer's whistle ,COMMA a whistle a trainer will blow to tell a dolphin it's done the right thing and can come get a fish .PERIOD
Many mammals have to produce contact calls when ,COMMA say ,COMMA a mother and calf are apart .PERIOD
What this figure shows is the percentage of the separations in which dolphins whistle ,COMMA against the maximum distance .PERIOD
So when dolphins are separating by less than 20 meters ,COMMA less than half the time they need to use whistles .PERIOD
Most of the time they can just find each other just by swimming around .PERIOD
And two boats :COLON When the second boat was added ,COMMA what happened was that some of the dolphins left the area completely .PERIOD
We may need to regulate the intensity of recreational boating and actual whale watching in order to prevent these kinds of problems .PERIOD
This is a kind of map we've all been looking at .PERIOD
So you're listening to the complicated song produced by humpbacks here .PERIOD
And this orange line here marks the typical songs of east coast humpbacks .PERIOD
It's loud ,COMMA clear -- you can hear it very clearly .PERIOD
But you can still hear that faint call .PERIOD
This is a figure from a textbook on underwater sound .PERIOD
Now think about it .PERIOD This is an amazing thing :COLON That in this frequency range where whales communicate ,COMMA the main source globally ,COMMA on our planet ,COMMA for the noise comes from human ships ,COMMA thousands of human ships ,COMMA distant ,COMMA far away ,COMMA just all aggregating .PERIOD
Same thing in the North Atlantic ,COMMA in the ' 50 s versus 2000 .PERIOD
So we have to be very concerned about when the noise in habitats degrades the habitat enough that the animals either have to pay too much to be able to communicate ,COMMA or are not able to perform critical functions .PERIOD
If you actually insulate and isolate the machinery of the ship from the hull ,COMMA you can reduce that noise by 99 percent .PERIOD
What Maersk did is they worked ways to slow down .PERIOD
And third ,COMMA you can create your own tours -- you can share them with friends ,COMMA you can create them with friends -- and that's the part that I think I'm most excited about because I think that at heart ,COMMA we are all storytellers .PERIOD
Curtis Wong :COLON Thank you ,COMMA Roy .PERIOD
So ,COMMA Microsoft -- this is a project that -- WorldWide Telescope is dedicated to Jim Gray ,COMMA who's our colleague ,COMMA and a lot of his work that he did is really what makes this project possible .PERIOD
And so ,COMMA what you've seen today is less than a fraction of one percent of what is in here ,COMMA and in the TED Lab ,COMMA we have a tour that was created by a six-year-old named Benjamin that will knock your socks off .PERIOD
Two-thirds of all students in special ed .PERIOD remedial programs are guys .PERIOD
And we're seeing a steady increase among males .PERIOD
They're also totally out of sync in romantic relationships ,COMMA which build gradually and subtly .PERIOD
I can create big things out here ,COMMA but I can go back and really quickly go back to where I started ,COMMA and make even smaller things here .PERIOD
But the neat thing about it is I can add control points .PERIOD
I mean ,COMMA this technique of being able to manipulate a mesh here ,COMMA with multiple control points ,COMMA is actually something that's state of the art .PERIOD
Don't worry .PERIOD
What we don't agree on is what the problem actually is .PERIOD
I think none of these is the problem .PERIOD
We want to go on with our daily life even though we are not living under normal circumstances .PERIOD
In the end ,COMMA Benjamín and Julián decided the best thing they could do was to organize the community and act together .PERIOD
That devotion we feel for the national football team .PERIOD
We need men and women who love Mexico and who are willing to take action .PERIOD
The battle is won ,COMMA but we still have to fight it .PERIOD
Juggling three balls is simple and normal .PERIOD
OK ,COMMA then you've got to combine them ,COMMA because then you have the whole spatial palette in front of you .PERIOD
And then you get crazy .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA I'm actually going to ask you to try something ,COMMA so you've got to pay attention .PERIOD Complexity :COLON if you spend enough time doing something ,COMMA time slows down or your skill increases ,COMMA so your perceptions change .PERIOD
Things slow down as you learn ,COMMA as you learn ,COMMA as you learn .PERIOD
So ,COMMA complexity .PERIOD Now ,COMMA how many here are jugglers ?QUESTIONMARK
OK ,COMMA so most of you are going to have a similar reaction to this .PERIOD
No ,COMMA it looks like a mess .PERIOD It looks like a mess with a guy there ,COMMA who's got his hands around that mess ,COMMA OK .PERIOD
It's being able to do something that other people can't do or can't understand .PERIOD
All right .PERIOD So ,COMMA that's one way of doing it ,COMMA which is five balls down .PERIOD
Make it wider .PERIOD
Make it narrower .PERIOD
Enough of a clue ?QUESTIONMARK So ,COMMA you get the pattern ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK OK .PERIOD
Pink .PERIOD
So white ball and -- finger ,COMMA finger ,COMMA finger ,COMMA finger ,COMMA finger ,COMMA finger ,COMMA finger ,COMMA finger .PERIOD Pink .PERIOD
Finger ,COMMA finger ,COMMA finger ,COMMA pink or finger .PERIOD
I don't need music for it .PERIOD Talking about time in a moment .PERIOD
Ahhh .PERIOD
So ,COMMA a moment .PERIOD
OK ?QUESTIONMARK And then ,COMMA what I did as a juggler was say ,COMMA OK ,COMMA what can I do to make that something that is dependent on something else ,COMMA another dynamic .PERIOD
So ,COMMA a moment .PERIOD
Are we ready to do that ?QUESTIONMARK Yes ?QUESTIONMARK
Now ,COMMA I'm going to show you the beginnings of a piece that is about balance in some ways ,COMMA and also -- oh ,COMMA actually ,COMMA if you're bored ,COMMA not here ,COMMA here's one use for it .PERIOD
Two Sticks ,COMMA you can go with it .PERIOD Thanks .PERIOD
It's a combination of that ,COMMA the beauty of that ,COMMA the shape ,COMMA and the stories that were involved in it ,COMMA as well as the fact that they protected the contents .PERIOD
And it's going to change as I go through it .PERIOD
I thought it [would] kind of be interesting to think back to that time when Richard got the whole thing started .PERIOD Thank you very much ,COMMA Richard ;SEMICOLON it's been a big ,COMMA enjoyable part of my life ,COMMA coming here .PERIOD
And so it was great fun in those days ,COMMA and some of those of you who are in the audience were my clients .PERIOD
We'd come in with some prototype underneath a black cloth and we'd put it on the conference table ,COMMA and we'd pull off the black cloth and everybody would ooh and ah .PERIOD
That was a really good time .PERIOD
But something's happened in the last 18 years since Richard started TED ,COMMA and that's that people like us -- I know people in other places have caught onto this for a long time ,COMMA but for us ,COMMA we've really just started .PERIOD we've kind of climbed Maslow's hierarchy a little bit -- and so we're now focused more and more on human-centered design ,COMMA human-centeredness in an approach to design .PERIOD
And I think you're starting to see that ,COMMA and it's making our job even more enjoyable .PERIOD
And so in order to do that we've been forming internal video-production groups in order to make these kind of experience prototypes that show just what we mean about the man-machine relationship .PERIOD
It's kind of like architects who show people in their houses ,COMMA as opposed to them being empty .PERIOD
So you can see what you look like from the back or all the way around ,COMMA as you look .PERIOD
This is CBS Sunday Morning that aired about two weeks ago .PERIOD
And my favorite feature ,COMMA which is a flower in a vase that wilts when you leave in disappointment ,COMMA and then when you come back ,COMMA it comes up to greet you ,COMMA happy to see you .PERIOD
The dome has an incredible amount of water that washes off of it ,COMMA as well as wastewater .PERIOD
The pavilion's design goal was to be kind of quiet and peaceful .PERIOD
It can dive to 500 feet ,COMMA to where sunlight does not penetrate ,COMMA and is equipped with powerful lights .PERIOD
(Narrator :COLON And this central box connects the whole system together .PERIOD
And so by doing that ,COMMA the woman that you saw in the first thing -- she's a school teacher -- always wanted to send her kids to college and she's going to be able to do it because of these things .PERIOD
As in this cryptic sentence I found in The Guardian recently :COLON The marriage suffered a setback in 1965 ,COMMA when the husband was killed by the wife .PERIOD
We can't see into the engine room .PERIOD
Electrons disappear in a kind of fuzz ,COMMA and there is only energy .PERIOD And you can't see energy .PERIOD
Not only is she aware of her physical repulsiveness ,COMMA she turns it to her advantage .PERIOD
So he went out and bought a plastic frame to put the photograph in .PERIOD
So ,COMMA one of the interesting things about invisibility is that things that we can't see we also can't understand .PERIOD
But we can't read each other's minds .PERIOD I find that quite astonishing .PERIOD
But their main exercise of telepathy is to send out powerful signals to the rest of us that it doesn't exist .PERIOD
And this is increasingly peculiar ,COMMA because about 20 years ago ,COMMA when they started delving into the genome ,COMMA they thought it would probably contain around 100000 genes .PERIOD
You can't see these things ,COMMA but they are very strange .PERIOD
Because that's where all the stuff happens that makes you who you are .PERIOD
This is fascinating .PERIOD You probably know ,COMMA some of you ,COMMA that cells are continually renewed .PERIOD You can see it in skin and this kind of stuff .PERIOD
But every cell in your body is replaced at some point .PERIOD
Livers and internal organs sort of take a bit longer .PERIOD A spine takes several years .PERIOD
There is so many things that -- Light .PERIOD
Five out of the 100 billion galaxies ,COMMA with the naked eye ,COMMA and one of them is quite difficult to see unless you've got very good eyesight .PERIOD
What the others are here for ,COMMA I've no idea .PERIOD
So we were thinking ,COMMA well the best way to learn from them is to read all of these millions of books .PERIOD
Now the problem is there's an X-axis for that ,COMMA which is the practical axis .PERIOD
This is extremely practical ,COMMA but not so awesome .PERIOD
Now again ,COMMA we kind of caved in ,COMMA and we did the very practical approach ,COMMA which was a bit less awesome .PERIOD
We said ,COMMA well instead of releasing the full text ,COMMA we're going to release statistics about the books .PERIOD
It's four words ;SEMICOLON we call that a four-gram .PERIOD
Well which one should I use ?QUESTIONMARK
As of about six months ago ,COMMA the state of the art in this field is that you would ,COMMA for instance ,COMMA go up to the following psychologist with fabulous hair ,COMMA and you'd say ,COMMA Steve ,COMMA you're an expert on the irregular verbs .PERIOD
So if you want to become famous early on ,COMMA you should be an actor ,COMMA because then fame starts rising by the end of your 20 s -- you're still young ,COMMA it's really great .PERIOD
One mistake you should not do is become a mathematician .PERIOD
Here's a simple way to do it .PERIOD
So for instance ,COMMA here -- this suppression index is for 5000 people picked in English books where there's no known suppression -- it would be like this ,COMMA basically tightly centered on one .PERIOD
What you expect is basically what you observe .PERIOD
But much more importantly ,COMMA the distribution is much wider .PERIOD
It's the application of massive-scale data collection analysis to the study of human culture .PERIOD
There's various types of frustration .PERIOD
This person studies all the arghs ,COMMA from one through eight A's .PERIOD
These all happen to be on our computers ,COMMA on computers across the world .PERIOD
And when that happens ,COMMA that will transform the way we have to understand our past ,COMMA our present and human culture .PERIOD
One of them is pattern recognition .PERIOD
We listen to differences ,COMMA we discount sounds that remain the same .PERIOD
Why did I say that ?QUESTIONMARK
Well there are a lot of reasons for this .PERIOD
And the art of conversation is being replaced -- dangerously ,COMMA I think -- by personal broadcasting .PERIOD
And only without conscious listening can these things happen -- a world where we don't listen to each other at all ,COMMA is a very scary place indeed .PERIOD
It's a great exercise for improving the quality of your listening .PERIOD
So mundane sounds can be really interesting if you pay attention .PERIOD
You can use this in listening ,COMMA in communication .PERIOD
Why is it not taught ?QUESTIONMARK It's crazy .PERIOD
Thank you for listening to me today .PERIOD
So what happened was ,COMMA when I was young and got out of engineering school at Cornell in ' 79 ,COMMA I decided -- I went to work for Intel and I was in the computer industry -- and three months into that ,COMMA I fell in love with something else ,COMMA and I said ,COMMA I made the wrong career choice here ,COMMA and I fell in love with brains .PERIOD
We are in the pre-paradigm days ,COMMA if you want to use Thomas Kuhn .PERIOD
And theory has not played a role in any sort of grand way in the neurosciences .PERIOD
You're more complicated than your brain .PERIOD You've got a brain .PERIOD
That's always been the case .PERIOD And so all we can say ,COMMA well ,COMMA my neocortex ,COMMA which is the part of the brain I'm interested in ,COMMA has 30 billion cells .PERIOD
The best minds were stumped -- really ,COMMA really smart people .PERIOD
It just turns out it's really hard to think of things ,COMMA but once you've thought of them ,COMMA it's kind of easy to understand it .PERIOD
So it was intuitive and obvious .PERIOD Now what about evolution ?QUESTIONMARK
And I'm going to work you through this in a few slides here ,COMMA give you an example of what this means .PERIOD Here's a system .PERIOD
And Alan Turing defined the Turing test ,COMMA which is essentially saying ,COMMA we'll know if something's intelligent if it behaves identical to a human .PERIOD
A behavioral metric of what intelligence is ,COMMA and this has stuck in our minds for a long period of time .PERIOD
You're not aware of this ,COMMA but your eyes are always moving .PERIOD
It's not always true ,COMMA but in general ,COMMA there's not a good history of theory in biology .PERIOD
Not like computer memory .PERIOD It's not at all like computer memory .PERIOD
You cannot learn or recall anything outside of a sequence .PERIOD
If you don't build it ,COMMA you don't understand it .PERIOD So ,COMMA one more slide here .PERIOD
The new brain is actually kind of easier than the old brain .PERIOD
But ultimately ,COMMA the world's the limit here .PERIOD
I don't know how this is going to turn out .PERIOD
They couldn't anticipate cell phones and the Internet and all this kind of stuff .PERIOD
I do not think about what I consider to be peace ,COMMA which is sustainable peace with justice and equality .PERIOD
But he's offering 84 billion dollars for the modernizing of nuclear weapons .PERIOD
In global terms ,COMMA it's a little bit of money .PERIOD
But it's going to modernize weapons we do not need and will not be gotten rid of in our lifetime ,COMMA unless we get up off our .PERIOD
I was in Hiroshima a couple of weeks ago ,COMMA and His Holiness -- we're sitting there in front of thousands of people in the city ,COMMA and there were about eight of us Nobel laureates .PERIOD
We're staring at everybody ,COMMA waiting our turn to speak ,COMMA and he leans over to me ,COMMA and he says ,COMMA Jody ,COMMA I'm a Buddhist monk .PERIOD
I spoke with Aung Sun Suu Kyi a couple of days ago .PERIOD
She said ,COMMA You know ,COMMA we have a long road to go to finally get democracy in my country .PERIOD
Here's another woman hero of mine .PERIOD
She says the airports of the world .PERIOD
They call her the Tree Lady ,COMMA but she's more than the Tree Lady .PERIOD
This is Rigoberta Menchu Tum .PERIOD
It's not a dirty word .PERIOD
It's hard work every single day .PERIOD
And then ,COMMA when she closed the door ,COMMA Grandma said ,COMMA No ,COMMA no ,COMMA no ,COMMA no .PERIOD
And they also ,COMMA when they want to travel ,COMMA they use flying machines that can take them to remote destinations .PERIOD
And they want the washing machine .PERIOD
So how come [this is] something that everyone uses and they think others will not stop it ?QUESTIONMARK What is special with this ?QUESTIONMARK
And over there they don't even use one each .PERIOD
What are the trends ?QUESTIONMARK If we just prolong the trends ,COMMA without any real advanced analysis ,COMMA to 2050 ,COMMA there are two things that can increase the energy use .PERIOD
And these 22 units -- still the richest people use most of it .PERIOD
They must change behavior in some way .PERIOD
They must also start to produce green energy ,COMMA much more green energy .PERIOD
I was like ,COMMA Okay ,COMMA that's social skill .PERIOD
You go to an elementary school at three in the afternoon and you watch the kids come out ,COMMA and they're wearing these 80 -pound backpacks .PERIOD
Another finding is that the unconscious ,COMMA far from being dumb and sexualized ,COMMA is actually quite smart .PERIOD
And the way you should do that is study the furniture ,COMMA let it marinate in your mind ,COMMA distract yourself ,COMMA and then a few days later ,COMMA go with your gut ,COMMA because unconsciously you've figured it out .PERIOD
Now I'm a middle-aged guy .PERIOD
They put them into a brain scan machine -- this is apocryphal by the way ,COMMA but I don't care -- and they had them watch a horror movie ,COMMA and then they had them describe their feelings toward their wives .PERIOD
They have trouble relating to other people .PERIOD
Ninety-five percent of our professors report that they are above-average teachers .PERIOD
They have epistemological modesty .PERIOD
They are open-minded in the face of ambiguity .PERIOD
The third trait is metis ,COMMA what we might call street smarts -- it's a Greek word .PERIOD
And that comes in tremendously handy ,COMMA because groups are smarter than individuals .PERIOD
What Picasso did ,COMMA for example ,COMMA was take the concept Western art and the concept African masks and blend them together -- not only the geometry ,COMMA but the moral systems entailed in them .PERIOD
And these are skills ,COMMA again ,COMMA we can't count and measure .PERIOD
Just to let you know ,COMMA I do not have a lexicographical whistle .PERIOD
But people think that my job is to let the good words make that difficult left-hand turn into the dictionary ,COMMA and keep the bad words out .PERIOD
And it's not very fun .PERIOD And when parts of your job are not easy or fun ,COMMA you kind of look for an excuse not to do them .PERIOD
But why do people want me to direct traffic ,COMMA when I would much rather go fishing ?QUESTIONMARK
Why do I blame the Queen ?QUESTIONMARK
So he's really responsible for a lot of what we consider modern in dictionaries today .PERIOD
I mean ,COMMA I'm a huge geek ,COMMA I love computers .PERIOD
It's steampunk .PERIOD What we have is an electric velocipede .PERIOD
Online dictionaries must be different .PERIOD
This is flat .PERIOD Look how many links there are in the actual entry :COLON two !EXCLAMATIONMARK
So ,COMMA it's not that we have good words and bad words .PERIOD
Some of my best friends are books .PERIOD
How can you say that a sledgehammer is better than a ball-peen hammer ?QUESTIONMARK
So if we're not worrying about directing traffic ,COMMA if we've transcended paper ,COMMA if we are worrying less about control and more about description ,COMMA then we can think of the English language as being this beautiful mobile .PERIOD
If only one out of every 10 of those books had a word that's not in the dictionary in it ,COMMA that would be equivalent to more than two unabridged dictionaries .PERIOD
You know ,COMMA it's pretty to look at for a while ,COMMA but then it dies .PERIOD
We can leave the aesthetic judgments to the writers and the speakers .PERIOD
I was 15 when I was gang-raped by eight men .PERIOD
But the rest ,COMMA who succumb into it ,COMMA go through everyday torture .PERIOD
These are men who buy you for an hour ,COMMA for a day ,COMMA and use you ,COMMA throw you .PERIOD
And we are silent about them .PERIOD
But the extra bonuses that she gets is various infections ,COMMA sexually transmitted infections ,COMMA HIV ,COMMA AIDS ,COMMA syphilis ,COMMA gonorrhea ,COMMA you name it ,COMMA substance abuse ,COMMA drugs ,COMMA everything under the sun .PERIOD
And therefore my challenge was to understand how can I get out the power from this pain .PERIOD
What has been my challenge ?QUESTIONMARK
My biggest challenge is society .PERIOD
It's you and me .PERIOD
But it is not nice to bring them to our homes .PERIOD
So ,COMMA I'm just going to grab a chair here .PERIOD
I had this company that I'd spent 15 years building .PERIOD It's called Future ;SEMICOLON it was a magazine publishing company .PERIOD
It had recently gone public and the market said that it was apparently worth two billion dollars ,COMMA a number I didn't really understand .PERIOD
The date was February 2000 .PERIOD
I mean ,COMMA it had to .PERIOD Right ?QUESTIONMARK I was in for quite a surprise .PERIOD
I watched my own net worth falling by about a million dollars a day ,COMMA every day ,COMMA for 18 months .PERIOD
Turns out that the research done on that is absolutely mind-blowing .PERIOD
It's the total brain experience ,COMMA we're going to .PERIOD
So ,COMMA I will .PERIOD Here's the vision for TED .PERIOD
This is a video prototype .PERIOD
And they don't react to background sounds .PERIOD
And we were quite intrigued with playing with the notion of invisibility .PERIOD
Soren enters the room .PERIOD Pop !EXCLAMATIONMARK He goes invisible .PERIOD
So people would walking into the room and they'd almost ignore it ,COMMA thinking it was some crap laying around .PERIOD
So this work is a caricature of an upside-down man .PERIOD
Because if that circle weren't there ,COMMA and the floor was very even ,COMMA it would start to wander about in the space .PERIOD
That's my colleague .PERIOD He's let it go .PERIOD
And if it isn't easily gotten ,COMMA we'll go ahead and steal it .PERIOD
While the carbon dioxide ,COMMA vast quantities of it ,COMMA gigatons ,COMMA goes into the atmosphere where we can't get it back -- yet -- and where it is causing the problems that we're most concerned about .PERIOD
They've run out of good sites .PERIOD
Babcock &amp ;SEMICOLON Wilcox that make nuclear reactors ,COMMA here's an integral fast reactor .PERIOD
CO 2 e emissions are equivalent emissions of all the greenhouse gases and particles that cause warming and converted to CO 2 .PERIOD
We have facilities around there .PERIOD You also have a buffer zone that's 17 square kilometers .PERIOD
And you have the uranium mining that you have to deal with .PERIOD
There are two nations ,COMMA North Korea and Israel ,COMMA that have nuclear weapons and don't have nuclear power at all .PERIOD
There's plenty of solar and wind .PERIOD
That's from real data .PERIOD
Solving the world's problems can be done ,COMMA if you really put your mind to it and use clean ,COMMA renewable energy .PERIOD
And in the United States Senate ,COMMA we need bipartisan support -- only one or two votes are needed -- to move global warming through the Senate ,COMMA and this room can help .PERIOD
The first is :COLON be aware of the propaganda .PERIOD
And I'm ,COMMA you know ,COMMA very much pro that kind of stuff .PERIOD
I campaigned against nuclear weapons in the ' 80 s ,COMMA and I continue to do so now .PERIOD
Because five years from now ,COMMA it will blow you away what we'll actually have as alternatives to this horrible ,COMMA disastrous nuclear power .PERIOD
Your final pitch ,COMMA Stewart .PERIOD
Okay .PERIOD So ,COMMA thank you ,COMMA Mark .PERIOD
It's during our lifetime that we're going to take the Earth ,COMMA take the people of Earth and transition off ,COMMA permanently .PERIOD And that's exciting .PERIOD
In fact ,COMMA I think it is a moral imperative that we open the space frontier .PERIOD
You know ,COMMA it's the first time that we're going to have a chance to have planetary redundancy ,COMMA a chance to ,COMMA if you would ,COMMA back up the biosphere .PERIOD
And if you think about space ,COMMA everything we hold of value on this planet -- metals and minerals and real estate and energy -- is in infinite quantities in space .PERIOD
And we knew nothing about going to space .PERIOD
We went from having literally put Alan Shepard in suborbital flight to going to the moon in eight years ,COMMA and the average age of the people that got us there was 26 years old .PERIOD
The shuttle is costing a billion dollars a launch .PERIOD
As we are going out there and taking on a new frontier ,COMMA we should be allowed to risk .PERIOD
In fact ,COMMA anyone who says we shouldn't ,COMMA you know ,COMMA just needs to be put aside ,COMMA because ,COMMA as we go forward ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA the greatest discoveries we will ever know is ahead of us .PERIOD
And in fact ,COMMA the large corporations ,COMMA the governments ,COMMA can't take the risk .PERIOD
We've got an altitude call of 368000 feet .PERIOD
Today ,COMMA you can go and experience weightless flights .PERIOD
Orbital flights -- we can take you to the space station .PERIOD
That was filmed inside our airplane ,COMMA and so ,COMMA you can now do this .PERIOD
Let me talk about the other thing I'm excited about .PERIOD
It may or may not happen .PERIOD But if you put up a prize ,COMMA the beautiful thing is ,COMMA you know ,COMMA it's a very small maintenance fee ,COMMA and you pay on success .PERIOD
My work is -- it's a reflection of myself .PERIOD
We all seem to think that ,COMMA you know ,COMMA if we look down on the ground ,COMMA there's nothing there .PERIOD
And we use the word nothing .PERIOD
I told her I couldn't face it because the way the teacher was treating me ,COMMA ridiculing me ,COMMA and using me as an example of failure .PERIOD
So I told her .PERIOD
And walked off .PERIOD And I didn't expect that ,COMMA because I expected one of these .PERIOD
So I'm sitting there thinking .PERIOD
So I did .PERIOD
But I thought ,COMMA perhaps the ant won't know ,COMMA it'll probably move in .PERIOD
And then I sat down and all the ants came along .PERIOD
It became part of me .PERIOD
As you can see ,COMMA that's a pinhead .PERIOD
Now that is called the Huf Haus .PERIOD
So I'm thinking ,COMMA Mr .PERIOD Huf isn't going to be very happy when I told him his house has gone to another ,COMMA into the atmosphere somewhere .PERIOD
So to cut the story short ,COMMA I decided that I had to go back and do it .PERIOD
So I found some more .PERIOD And I decided to ,COMMA sort of ,COMMA construct it very ,COMMA very slowly ,COMMA holding my breath ,COMMA working between my heartbeat ,COMMA and making sure everything is leveled .PERIOD
I noticed that the house was occupied .PERIOD
So basically I'd completed the house .PERIOD
So I didn't think he was going to throw Bart off .PERIOD
And sometimes they turn into little catapults and things go up in the air .PERIOD
But I would never do it to a living fly .PERIOD
Even though they get on our nerves ,COMMA I would never kill an insect because ,COMMA All creatures great and small -- there is a hymn that says that .PERIOD
So I have to be very very careful .PERIOD
My work ,COMMA rough estimate ,COMMA sometimes five ,COMMA six to seven weeks ;SEMICOLON you can't always anticipate .PERIOD
As you can see ,COMMA there's an aphid fly there .PERIOD
I remember one time I was doing it ,COMMA and the window was open .PERIOD
And then she looked at me .PERIOD
And I cut off a little flake of gold .PERIOD
Because I had to put the torch on the top .PERIOD
The flag had to be made out of little strands of gold .PERIOD
It's almost like doing a surgical operation to get this thing right .PERIOD
And that was done with a particle from my shirt .PERIOD
My point is here ,COMMA people have a choice -- just like the Indian lady could wear her sari or the Japanese woman could wear her kimono .PERIOD
Which is why I prefer the Richard Wilk analogy of globalizing the local and localizing the global .PERIOD
And therefore tradition becomes more important ,COMMA not less important .PERIOD
We're here ,COMMA we're part of a community ,COMMA sharing out ideas and discussing them .PERIOD
Art becomes a very important part of our national identity .PERIOD
We have done extensive research to ensure that Arab and Muslim artists ,COMMA and Arabs who are not Muslims -- not all Arabs are Muslims ,COMMA by the way -- but we make sure that they are represented in this new institution .PERIOD
For me it was a new discovery .PERIOD
Now visual expression is just one form of culture integration .PERIOD
In a similar way ,COMMA we have created the Doha Film Institute .PERIOD
Who are you playing ?QUESTIONMARK
The Doha Tribeca Film Festival was held at our new cultural hub ,COMMA Katara .PERIOD
I welcome you on board for us to engage and discuss new ideas of how to bring people together through cultural initiatives and discussions .PERIOD
And in a saying of the Koran ,COMMA which to Muslims is God speaking to humanity ,COMMA God says to his prophet Muhammad -- whom we believe to be the last of a series of prophets ,COMMA beginning with Adam ,COMMA including Noah ,COMMA including Moses ,COMMA including Abraham ,COMMA including Jesus Christ ,COMMA and ending with Muhammad -- that ,COMMA We have not sent you ,COMMA O Muhammad ,COMMA except as a 'rahmah' except as a source of compassion to humanity .PERIOD
The esoteric path of Islam is more popularly known as Sufism ,COMMA or tasawwuf in Arabic .PERIOD
The language differs ,COMMA but the objective is the same .PERIOD
And therefore ,COMMA for us to be human -- in the greatest sense of what it means to be human ,COMMA in the most joyful sense of what it means to be human -- means that we too have to be proper stewards of the breath of divinity within us ,COMMA and seek to perfect within ourselves the attribute of being ,COMMA of being alive ,COMMA of beingness ;SEMICOLON the attribute of wisdom ,COMMA of consciousness ,COMMA of awareness ;SEMICOLON and the attribute of being compassionate and loving beings .PERIOD
And I believe ,COMMA personally ,COMMA that we're on the verge and that ,COMMA with the presence and help of people like you here ,COMMA we can bring about the prophecy of Isaiah .PERIOD
My story actually began when I was four years old and my family moved to a new neighborhood in our hometown of Savannah ,COMMA Georgia .PERIOD
That's why they were called ape hangers .PERIOD
And one afternoon ,COMMA I got a call from my doctor .PERIOD
The next day I came to see him .PERIOD I was like ,COMMA Doctor ,COMMA that was a really good joke .PERIOD
I believe my girls will have plenty of opportunities in their lives ,COMMA I wrote these men .PERIOD
Linda ,COMMA my wife ,COMMA joked that it was like having six different marriage proposals .PERIOD
And on that first day we were in this youth hostel in a castle .PERIOD
Will you help be their dad ?QUESTIONMARK
And I got to the end -- he was crying and I was crying -- and then he looked at me ,COMMA and he said ,COMMA Yes .PERIOD
And as he talked he had that glint in his eye that I first saw back in Holland -- the glint that says ,COMMA Let's go cow tipping ,COMMA even though we never did tip the cow ,COMMA even though no one tips the cow ,COMMA even though cows don't sleep standing up .PERIOD
And then I had a 15 -hour surgery in which my surgeon ,COMMA Dr .PERIOD John Healey at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Hospital in New York ,COMMA took out my left femur and replaced it with titanium .PERIOD
And anybody who came to see me had to cover themselves in a mask and cover all of the extraneous parts of their body .PERIOD
When my wife and I had kids ,COMMA we thought it would be all-hands-on-deck .PERIOD
Instead ,COMMA it was everybody running the other way .PERIOD
And there was something incredibly profound about sitting down with my closest friends and telling them what they meant to me .PERIOD
Now David is my literary agent .PERIOD
So one day near the end of my journey ,COMMA I said ,COMMA Come on girls ,COMMA let's take a walk across the Brooklyn Bridge .PERIOD
We set out on crutches .PERIOD
And yet ,COMMA for the four million years humans have been walking upright ,COMMA the act is essentially unchanged .PERIOD
As my physical therapist likes to say ,COMMA Every step is a tragedy waiting to happen .PERIOD
You go slow ,COMMA you get where you're going ,COMMA but you get there with this community you built along the way .PERIOD
So I stand here today as you see now ,COMMA walking without crutches or a cane .PERIOD
And last week I had my 18 -month scans .PERIOD
And all the collective minds in this room ,COMMA I dare say ,COMMA can never find a solution for scan-xiety .PERIOD
I feel that I've fitted in ,COMMA in many ways ,COMMA to some of the things that I've heard .PERIOD
They're fighting to develop their own way of living within the forest in a world that's clean ,COMMA a world that isn't contaminated ,COMMA a world that isn't polluted .PERIOD
But ,COMMA of course ,COMMA my real field of expertise lies in an even different kind of civilization -- I can't really call it a civilization .PERIOD
And I propose to bring into this TED conference ,COMMA as I always do around the world ,COMMA the voice of the animal kingdom .PERIOD
The chimps -- there's no time to discuss their fascinating lives -- but they have this long childhood ,COMMA five years of suckling and sleeping with the mother ,COMMA and then another three ,COMMA four or five years of emotional dependence on her ,COMMA even when the next child is born .PERIOD
They can actually live longer than 60 in captivity ,COMMA so we've only done 40 years in the wild so far .PERIOD
We know that chimpanzees and some other creatures can recognize themselves in mirrors -- self as opposed to other .PERIOD
They're disappearing for the reasons that all of you in this room know only too well .PERIOD
And people will pay more for bush-meat ,COMMA as it's called ,COMMA than for domestic meat -- it's culturally preferred .PERIOD
We can talk about the distant past ,COMMA plan for the distant future ,COMMA discuss ideas with each other ,COMMA so that the ideas can grow from the accumulated wisdom of a group .PERIOD
And that's not just in the far-away developing world ;SEMICOLON that's everywhere .PERIOD
Somebody said that yesterday .PERIOD
And Roots and Shoots is a program for hope .PERIOD
See the brick walls as all the problems that we've inflicted on this planet .PERIOD
It isn't something that their parents tell them ,COMMA or their teachers tell them .PERIOD
That's effective ,COMMA but if they decide themselves ,COMMA We want to clean this river and put the fish back that used to be there .PERIOD
No violence ,COMMA no bombs ,COMMA no guns .PERIOD
How many more minutes ?QUESTIONMARK Two ,COMMA one ?QUESTIONMARK
And it's been so clear how much you all care about trying to make this world a better place .PERIOD
It's very encouraging .PERIOD
And we've talked a lot about that .PERIOD
And then as I went around the country after that and felt the fear -- the fear that was leading to people feeling they couldn't worry about the environment any more ,COMMA in case they seemed not to be patriotic -- and I was trying to encourage them ,COMMA somebody came up with a little quotation from Mahatma Gandhi ,COMMA If you look back through human history ,COMMA you see that every evil regime has been overcome by good .PERIOD
And just after that a woman brought me this little bell ,COMMA and I want to end on this note .PERIOD
It's in our hands .PERIOD
If we lead lives where we consciously leave the lightest possible ecological footprints ,COMMA if we buy the things that are ethical for us to buy and don't buy the things that are not ,COMMA we can change the world overnight .PERIOD
In the laboratory what we want to do is much the same ,COMMA but with on the order of tens of different types of molecules -- so a drastic reduction in complexity ,COMMA but still trying to produce something that looks lifelike .PERIOD
This is how we can start to make a protocell .PERIOD
As you know ,COMMA when you put oil and water together ,COMMA they don't mix ,COMMA but through self-assembly we can get a nice oil droplet to form ,COMMA and we can actually use this as a body for our artificial organism or for our protocell ,COMMA as you will see later .PERIOD
This structure ,COMMA then ,COMMA can organize the formation of a membrane boundary around itself ,COMMA so it can make a body of liquid molecules around itself ,COMMA and that's shown in green here on this micrograph .PERIOD
It's actually quite lifeless .PERIOD Once it forms ,COMMA it doesn't really do anything .PERIOD
So some things that are missing is ,COMMA for example ,COMMA if you had a flow of energy through a system ,COMMA what we'd want is a protocell that can harvest some of that energy in order to maintain itself ,COMMA much like living systems do .PERIOD
So I add some food source to the system .PERIOD
So then we put these protocells together in a single experiment to see what they would do ,COMMA and depending on the conditions ,COMMA we have some protocells on the left that are moving around and it likes to touch the other structures in its environment .PERIOD
So then I repeated this experiment a bunch of times ,COMMA and one time something very interesting happened .PERIOD
So since we can make some interesting protocells that we like ,COMMA interesting colors and interesting behaviors ,COMMA and they're very easy to make ,COMMA and they have interesting lifelike properties ,COMMA perhaps these protocells have something to tell us about the origin of life on the Earth .PERIOD Perhaps these represent an easily accessible step ,COMMA one of the first steps by which life got started on the early Earth .PERIOD
They look really good ,COMMA very nice movement ,COMMA and also they appear to have some kind of behavior where they kind of circle around each other and follow each other ,COMMA similar to what we've seen before -- but again ,COMMA working with just primordial conditions ,COMMA no pure chemicals .PERIOD
They're even better models of environmental health ,COMMA because not only the same mammalian biology ,COMMA but they share your diet ,COMMA largely .PERIOD
So they drank as much vodka as they did plain water ,COMMA which was interesting .PERIOD
I just want to say it was sort of a rule of thumb though ,COMMA there's about two or three fire hydrants on every city block .PERIOD
They flatten a few plants .PERIOD No big deal ,COMMA they'll regenerate .PERIOD
That 99 percent of the time when a firetruck is not parking there ,COMMA it's infiltrating pollutants .PERIOD
So these are small actions that can amount to a significant effect to improve local environmental health .PERIOD
Here's one of them that we have up now .PERIOD
When a fish swims underneath ,COMMA a light goes on .PERIOD
This is what it looks like .PERIOD
So there's another function on here .PERIOD
And they text back .PERIOD
In this case ,COMMA instead of throwing chewing gum ,COMMA or Doritos or whatever you have in your pocket at the fish -- There's a body of water in Iceland that I've been dealing with that's in the middle of the city ,COMMA and the largest pollution burden on it is not the roadborne pollution ,COMMA it's actually white bread from people feeding the fish and the birds .PERIOD
They're cross-species delicious that is ,COMMA delicious for humans and non-humans .PERIOD
And you say ,COMMA boy ,COMMA that's a lot .PERIOD
But you know what ?QUESTIONMARK
Now ,COMMA if you parked those end to end and wrapped them around the Earth ,COMMA that would stretch around the Earth 125 times .PERIOD
And we wanted to take advantage of Moore's Law with electronic controls and software ,COMMA and we absolutely wanted our car to be connected .PERIOD
So let me talk about hydrogen first .PERIOD
The beauty of hydrogen is it can come from so many different sources :COLON it can come from fossil fuels ,COMMA it can come from any way that you can create electricity ,COMMA including renewables .PERIOD
And hydrogen and fuel cells give us that opportunity to actually use our cars and trucks when they're parked to generate electricity for the grid .PERIOD
And we talked about swarm networks earlier .PERIOD
Actually the theme of this conference ,COMMA I think ,COMMA has hit on really one of the major keys to pull that off -- and that's relationships and working together .PERIOD
I just want to ask one .PERIOD
We're into this over a billion dollars already ,COMMA so I would hope people would think we're serious when we're spending that kind of money .PERIOD
In Oxford ,COMMA perhaps we can use Lewis Carroll and look in the looking glass that is New York City to try and see our true selves ,COMMA or perhaps pass through to another world .PERIOD
My colleagues and I have been working for 10 years to rediscover this lost world in a project we call The Mannahatta Project .PERIOD
And I'd like to tell you the story in three acts ,COMMA and if I have time still ,COMMA an epilogue .PERIOD
It was once a beach .PERIOD And this painting has John James Audubon ,COMMA the painter ,COMMA sitting on the rock .PERIOD
Or this painting ,COMMA from the 1740 s ,COMMA from Greenwich Village .PERIOD
Here's Bowling Green .PERIOD And here's Broadway .PERIOD
And just beyond it you can see features that have vanished ,COMMA things that have disappeared .PERIOD
Or Murray Hill .PERIOD And this is the Murrays' house on Murray Hill ,COMMA 200 years ago .PERIOD
And I thought to myself ,COMMA You know ,COMMA if I could georeference this map ,COMMA if I could place this map in the grid of the city today ,COMMA I could find these lost features of the city ,COMMA in the block-by-block geography that people know ,COMMA the geography of where people go to work ,COMMA and where they go to live ,COMMA and where they like to eat .PERIOD
Then ,COMMA if we added maps like the geology ,COMMA the bedrock geology ,COMMA and the surface geology ,COMMA what the glaciers leave ,COMMA if we make the soil map ,COMMA with the 17 soil classes ,COMMA that are defined by the National Conservation Service ,COMMA if we make a digital elevation model of the topography that tells us how high the hills were ,COMMA then we can calculate the slopes .PERIOD
We can calculate the aspect .PERIOD
The white areas on this map are the places protected from the winter winds .PERIOD
We compiled all the information about where the Native Americans were ,COMMA the Lenape .PERIOD
And the old fields ,COMMA the successional fields that go .PERIOD
It was really an extraordinary landscape that was capable of supporting an extraordinary biodiversity .PERIOD
As if these were the maps that we would need to predict where you would find the beaver .PERIOD
An aspen needs fire and dry soils .PERIOD
But what are the conditions that make it possible ?QUESTIONMARK
And these would be the kind of trees that might have been there ,COMMA and the flowers and the lichens and the mosses ,COMMA the butterflies ,COMMA the fish in the stream ,COMMA the birds in the trees .PERIOD
And perhaps a black bear walked by .PERIOD And maybe Native Americans were there .PERIOD
And we used it to try and reveal a landscape here in Act III .PERIOD
We can see the fields that the Native Americans made .PERIOD
So when you're watching Law and Order ,COMMA and the lawyers walk up the steps they could have walked back down those steps of the New York Court House ,COMMA right into the Collect Pond ,COMMA 400 years ago .PERIOD
And I think this is what we're learning about building cities in the future .PERIOD
This is the particular additional habitat requirement of humanity .PERIOD
Fill in the blanks .PERIOD
Unfortunately ,COMMA while this society is ,COMMA without a doubt ,COMMA the most prosperous and dynamic the world has ever created ,COMMA it's got some major ,COMMA major flaws .PERIOD
Clearly we don't have 10 planets .PERIOD
And they may not want to live exactly like us .PERIOD
You know ,COMMA so on the one hand we have the unthinkable ;SEMICOLON on the other hand we have the unimaginable .PERIOD
You know ,COMMA what we're out there doing is looking for examples of tools ,COMMA models and ideas ,COMMA which ,COMMA if widely adopted ,COMMA would change the game .PERIOD
Here ,COMMA for example ,COMMA is Vancouver ,COMMA which if you haven't been there ,COMMA you ought to go for a visit .PERIOD It's a fabulous city .PERIOD
But once you also have people living in close proximity to each other ,COMMA one of the things you can do is -- as information technologies develop -- you can start to have smart places .PERIOD
They live in the emerging megacities of the developing world .PERIOD
All throughout the developing world ,COMMA people are going directly to cell phones ,COMMA skipping the whole landline stage .PERIOD
When you have free ability for people to freely work together and innovate ,COMMA you get different kinds of solutions .PERIOD
And those solutions are accessible in a different way to people who don't have capital .PERIOD Right ?QUESTIONMARK
It's doing something new .PERIOD There's new things happening .PERIOD
You have other radical examples where the ability to use cultural tools is spreading out .PERIOD
Another world is possible .PERIOD
We tweak that a lot .PERIOD
We're looking a lot at this .PERIOD This is spreading everywhere .PERIOD
This is from A Force More Powerful .PERIOD It's a little screenshot .PERIOD
These are refrigerators that require no electricity ;SEMICOLON they're pot within a pot design .PERIOD
How do we help people like that ?QUESTIONMARK
Audience :COLON It detects landmines .PERIOD
If you are living in one of the places where the roughly half-billion unaccounted for mines are scattered ,COMMA you can fling these seeds out into the field .PERIOD
And policing copyright violations for children's birthday cakes was such a hassle that the College Bakery said ,COMMA You know what ,COMMA we're getting out of that business .PERIOD
If you're an amateur ,COMMA you don't have access to our machine anymore .PERIOD
So the policing layer around the problem becomes the real threat of the act .PERIOD
And the back story is this :COLON SOPA and PIPA ,COMMA as legislation ,COMMA were drafted largely by media companies that were founded in the 20 th century .PERIOD
And Congress did something .PERIOD
And that law was called the Audio Home Recording Act of 1992 .PERIOD
So when the Audio Home Recording Act of 1992 was passed ,COMMA the media businesses gave up on the idea of legal versus illegal distinctions for copying because it was clear that if Congress was acting in their framework ,COMMA they might actually increase the rights of citizens to participate in our own media environment .PERIOD
It was a complicated piece of legislation ,COMMA a lot of moving parts .PERIOD
That is a side effect of their ordinary operation .PERIOD
Every DVD player and game player and television and computer you brought home -- no matter what you thought you were getting when you bought it -- could be broken by the content industries ,COMMA if they wanted to set that as a condition of selling you the content .PERIOD
So this is the Internet they have in mind .PERIOD
Imagine it says TED ,COMMA because the comments can't be policed at any acceptable cost .PERIOD
And if you're not an American citizen ,COMMA you can contact American citizens that you know and encourage them to do the same .PERIOD
And the DMCA goes back to the Audio Home Recording Act ,COMMA which horrified those industries .PERIOD
They just want the sharing to go away .PERIOD
The whole world is laid out for you ,COMMA the best jobs are laid out for you ,COMMA and you want to go and work in a village ?QUESTIONMARK
What the poor thought was important would be reflected in the college .PERIOD
You failed in your exam ?QUESTIONMARK
The education system in India makes you look at Paris and New Delhi and Zurich ;SEMICOLON what are you doing in this village ?QUESTIONMARK
You have to have a dignity of labor .PERIOD
A traditional midwife is a professional .PERIOD
And it's the only college where we don't give a certificate .PERIOD
So when I said that ,COMMA they said ,COMMA Well show us what is possible .PERIOD What are you doing ?QUESTIONMARK
The men should clear out because we don't want to share this technology with the men .PERIOD
It's the only college which is fully solar-electrified .PERIOD
So long as the sun shines ,COMMA we'll have no problem with power .PERIOD
And we have 60 meals twice a day of solar cooking .PERIOD
She looks after 20 goats in the morning ,COMMA but she's prime minister in the evening .PERIOD
Wasn't dazzled at all by what was happening .PERIOD
Where the percentage of illiteracy is very high ,COMMA we use puppetry .PERIOD
Why ?QUESTIONMARK Because they want to leave the village and go to a city ,COMMA looking for a job .PERIOD
Comes back ,COMMA goes into the village ,COMMA says ,COMMA Well what's the story ?QUESTIONMARK
They said ,COMMA These two grandmothers .PERIOD Grandmothers ?QUESTIONMARK The minister couldn't believe what was happening .PERIOD
Went straight to the president .PERIOD
So he summoned me and said ,COMMA Can you train me 150 grandmothers ?QUESTIONMARK
I said ,COMMA Yeah ,COMMA she is very beautiful .PERIOD
And when I went back six months later ,COMMA I said ,COMMA Where's your husband ?QUESTIONMARK
Don't listen to the World Bank ,COMMA listen to the people on the ground .PERIOD
Our scientist colleagues are finding new patterns in the information .PERIOD
For artists ,COMMA we're making new worlds that we can uncover and explore .PERIOD
The white dots are the probability wave that will show you where the electron is in any given point of time and space in this particular three-orbital configuration .PERIOD
What kind of remarkable machinery does this guy have in his head ?QUESTIONMARK
A system of cognitive processes ,COMMA largely non-conscious cognitive processes ,COMMA that help them change their views of the world ,COMMA so that they can feel better about the worlds in which they find themselves .PERIOD
Who are these characters who are so damn happy ?QUESTIONMARK
Some of you are old enough to remember :COLON he was the chairman of the House of Representatives and he resigned in disgrace when this young Republican named Newt Gingrich found out about a shady book deal he had done .PERIOD
So he went to find them .PERIOD They said ,COMMA We can give you a franchise on this for 3000 bucks .PERIOD
And finally :COLON never ever join the Beatles .PERIOD
In this case ,COMMA because the experiment I'm going to tell you about uses them ,COMMA these are Monet prints .PERIOD
We did this experiment with a group of patients who had anterograde amnesia .PERIOD These are hospitalized patients .PERIOD
We then gave them the choice between number three and number four .PERIOD
Really ,COMMA Jim ,COMMA you don't remember ?QUESTIONMARK I was just here with the Monet prints ?QUESTIONMARK
Free ?QUESTIONMARK Aren't you just giving me my own paper ?QUESTIONMARK
What are you doing ?QUESTIONMARK
They don't like their picture ,COMMA and in fact even after the opportunity to swap has expired ,COMMA they still don't like their picture .PERIOD Why ?QUESTIONMARK
We could do it so that when you take the two pictures ,COMMA you'd have four days to change your mind ,COMMA or we're doing another course where you take the two pictures and you make up your mind right away and you can never change it .PERIOD Which course would you like to be in ?QUESTIONMARK
Let me parenthetically pause here and tell you -- Esther ,COMMA my mother ,COMMA had stopped driving several years ago ,COMMA to the collective relief of the entire city of Atlanta .PERIOD
There's a historical marker .PERIOD
I guess I must .PERIOD
Oh ,COMMA Jesus .PERIOD
Puts it in reverse .PERIOD Fifty-five out of the driveway ,COMMA in reverse .PERIOD
I've got a white-knuckle grip on the door .PERIOD You know what I'm talking about ?QUESTIONMARK
And there she goes ,COMMA right .PERIOD
OK ,COMMA so I stopped at a light and there's a guy ,COMMA you know ,COMMA in the back .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA you have all been at a mall during the holidays ,COMMA yes ?QUESTIONMARK
It will upset you .PERIOD
Look ,COMMA the Chevy -- he's coming this way .PERIOD
How many of you once in your -- you were a kid ,COMMA you were an adult -- you stood in a parking space to hold it for someone ?QUESTIONMARK
Of course ,COMMA her comeback is ,COMMA When have I embarrassed you ?QUESTIONMARK
A brevity ,COMMA brevity of everything with this child .PERIOD
But she pauses occasionally and says ,COMMA How do you spell that ?QUESTIONMARK What year ?QUESTIONMARK OK .PERIOD
When she writes the expose in about 20 years ,COMMA don't believe a word of it .PERIOD
But this is my daughter ,COMMA Lauren ,COMMA my remarkable daughter ,COMMA my borderline Asperger's kid .PERIOD
She says ,COMMA Ma ,COMMA you got to look !EXCLAMATIONMARK
Now ,COMMA when this kid says I got to look ,COMMA you know .PERIOD
Oh ,COMMA Jesus .PERIOD Oh ,COMMA Jesus .PERIOD
I finally come -- and now ,COMMA it's the South .PERIOD
We want to curl up and say ,COMMA Tell it to me ,COMMA tell it to me .PERIOD
I'm with the little lady .PERIOD Damn !EXCLAMATIONMARK
After I say -- let me refresh you -- have you no shame ?QUESTIONMARK
With her is a young man -- husband ,COMMA brother ,COMMA lover ,COMMA it's not my job .PERIOD
They turn then ,COMMA shoulder to shoulder ,COMMA and walk away ,COMMA lost in their own reverie .PERIOD
And they use motors that literally are used on cruise missile boosters .PERIOD
Voices :COLON Woohoo !EXCLAMATIONMARK Yeah .PERIOD Nice .PERIOD
What are catastrophic effects ?QUESTIONMARK A three degree centigrade climate change rise that will result in 50 percent species extinction .PERIOD
But now I'll talk about some more pleasant things .PERIOD
How fabulous .PERIOD Why would you ever want to go by yourself in your own car ?QUESTIONMARK
Where can I go today and who can I do it with ?QUESTIONMARK
It's when you charge a premium for people to drive on congested roads .PERIOD
In London ,COMMA the day they turned the congestion pricing on ,COMMA there was a 25 percent decrease in congestion overnight ,COMMA and that's persisted for the four years in which they've been doing congestion pricing .PERIOD
You weren't going to put tollbooths around the city of London and open and shut those gates .PERIOD
And road pricing is where we're all going to have to go ,COMMA because today we pay for our maintenance and wear and tear on our cars with gas taxes .PERIOD
And if we have it ,COMMA you'll decide how many miles to drive ,COMMA what mode of travel ,COMMA where to live and work .PERIOD
Again ,COMMA all mesh-enabled .PERIOD Monthly communication cost :COLON zero .PERIOD
They're resilient ;SEMICOLON their redundancy is built into this fabulous decentralized design .PERIOD
These things are going to happen .PERIOD
Maybe we shouldn't wait for the 10 or 15 years for this to happen .PERIOD
And if I had my druthers ,COMMA we would have an open-source version in addition to open standards .PERIOD
When I went this morning to Larry Brilliant's TEDTalk prize -- his fabulous networks -- imagine if there was an open-source mesh communications device that can be put into those networks ,COMMA to make all that happen .PERIOD
So the Awesome story :COLON It begins about 40 years ago ,COMMA when my mom and my dad came to Canada .PERIOD
My dad left a small village outside of Amritsar ,COMMA India .PERIOD
And they got here in the late 1960 s .PERIOD
We grew up taking for granted a lot of the things that my parents couldn't take for granted when they grew up -- things like power always on in our houses ,COMMA things like schools across the street and hospitals down the road and popsicles in the backyard .PERIOD
So you can't actually see them ,COMMA but it was breathtaking ,COMMA believe me .PERIOD
My marriage wasn't going well ,COMMA and we just were growing further and further apart .PERIOD
One day my wife came home from work and summoned the courage ,COMMA through a lot of tears ,COMMA to have a very honest conversation .PERIOD
And as these dark clouds were circling me ,COMMA and I was finding it really ,COMMA really difficult to think of anything good ,COMMA I said to myself that I really needed a way to focus on the positive somehow .PERIOD
And nobody read it except for my mom .PERIOD
Flash-forward to the next year and The Book of Awesome has now been number one on the bestseller list for 20 straight weeks .PERIOD
But look ,COMMA I said I wanted to do three things with you today .PERIOD
It's sad ,COMMA and it's not pleasant to talk about ,COMMA but your husband might leave you ,COMMA your girlfriend could cheat ,COMMA your headaches might be more serious than you thought ,COMMA or your dog could get hit by a car on the street .PERIOD
And there are times in life when you will be tossed in the well ,COMMA too ,COMMA with twists in your stomach and with holes in your heart ,COMMA and when that bad news washes over you ,COMMA and when that pain sponges and soaks in ,COMMA I just really hope you feel like you've always got two choices .PERIOD
Because you all used to be three years old .PERIOD
That three-year-old girl is still part of you .PERIOD
These were four guys on the LA .PERIOD Rams in the 1960 s you did not want to go up against .PERIOD
I'd like to pause my TEDTalk for about 10 seconds right now ,COMMA because you don't get many opportunities in life to do something like this ,COMMA and my parents are sitting in the front row .PERIOD
He would say ,COMMA Look ,COMMA can you believe they have a mango here from Mexico ?QUESTIONMARK
You can sleep in clean sheets .PERIOD

Dan Rather :COLON Since the September 11 th attack on the World Trade Center ,COMMA many people have flocked to downtown New York to see and pay respects at what amounts to the 16 -acre burial ground .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA as CBS's Jim Axelrod reports ,COMMA they're putting the finishing touches on a new way for people to visit and view the scene .PERIOD
There's a new place in New York where the crowds are thickest -- Ground Zero .PERIOD
This is ours .PERIOD
David Rockwell :COLON The first experience people will have here when they see this is not as a construction site but as this incredibly moving burial ground .PERIOD
The walls are bare by design ,COMMA so people can fill them with their own memorials the way they already have along the current perimeter .PERIOD
Your work is highly sensual ,COMMA even hedonistic .PERIOD
But I've got to tell you -- it became impossible to do that .PERIOD
We were really paralyzed .PERIOD
And in discussing this with other architects ,COMMA we had seen people saying in the press that they should rebuild the towers as they were -- they should rebuild them 50 stories taller .PERIOD
It was predominantly a white ,COMMA rich ,COMMA corporate group that was not representative of the city .PERIOD
And I think this was the 21 st ,COMMA and we knew this had to be built and up by the 28 th .PERIOD
In fact ,COMMA it was as if this was going to be window-washing scaffolding .PERIOD
And I've got to say that we spent a lot of time in putting this together ,COMMA watching the crowds that gathered at Saint Paul -- which is just to the right -- and moving around the site .PERIOD
No .PERIOD In fact I told the contractor to go ahead .PERIOD
I think this is ,COMMA obviously ,COMMA substantially different from anything we'd ever thought about doing before ,COMMA just by the nature of it .PERIOD
Well ,COMMA I think one thing that shouldn't be done is evaluate -- I think right now the discussion is a very closed discussion on the master plan .PERIOD
I don't think it has much to do with 50 or 60 or 70 or 80 thousand new office spaces ,COMMA regardless of what the number is .PERIOD
And in fact ,COMMA there's a proposal on the table now for building number seven .PERIOD
Right ,COMMA which the towers fell into .PERIOD
And the reason that's been held up is essentially by community outrage that they're not re-opening the street to connect that back to the rest of the city .PERIOD
This small foundation we put together is looking for other ways to help .PERIOD
So I thought that would be good to end with .PERIOD
One of the tricky issues we had with the Giuliani administration was I had forgotten how anti-graffiti he was .PERIOD
And essentially our structure was designed to be written on .PERIOD
As you say ,COMMA it's not a memorial .PERIOD
But the kind of virtually instantaneous nature of its erection ,COMMA and its being there ,COMMA almost before you could believe that a response of this magnitude could be accomplished ,COMMA is part of its extraordinary -- I don't know if beauty is the word -- but presence .PERIOD
So ,COMMA a funny thing happened on my way to becoming a brilliant ,COMMA world-class neuropsychologist :COLON I had a baby .PERIOD
Sorry ,COMMA TED .PERIOD
Because this is what I do .PERIOD This is what I teach .PERIOD
So look to the right-hand side of the screen .PERIOD

Now I thought that it was because I have this totally compelling helmet crusade ,COMMA right ,COMMA this epiphany of Tom's .PERIOD
Thank you .PERIOD
This is but one :COLON this is Frank Gehry the architect's precursor to the Guggenheim in Abu Dhabi .PERIOD
So my first topic with respect to this ,COMMA was not death ,COMMA but obesity .PERIOD
So this is a slide of some of our initial results .PERIOD
How big are the clusters ?QUESTIONMARK How far do they reach ?QUESTIONMARK
This here shows ,COMMA on the Y-axis ,COMMA the increase in the probability that a person is obese given that a social contact of theirs is obese and ,COMMA on the X-axis ,COMMA the degrees of separation between the two people .PERIOD
And the next bar over ,COMMA the [red] line ,COMMA says if your friend's friends are obese ,COMMA your risk of obesity is 25 percent higher .PERIOD
There are at least three possibilities :COLON One possibility is that ,COMMA as I gain weight ,COMMA it causes you to gain weight .PERIOD
Another more subtle possibility is that they start gaining weight ,COMMA and it changes your ideas of what an acceptable body size is .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA I want to be very clear :COLON We do not think our work should or could justify prejudice against people of one or another body size at all .PERIOD
And ,COMMA by the end ,COMMA you're going to see clusters of obese and non-obese individuals within the network .PERIOD
And so this function of emotions suggests that ,COMMA in addition to any other purpose they serve ,COMMA they're a kind of primitive form of communication .PERIOD
And whether you become happy or not depends in part on whether you occupy a happy patch .PERIOD
So ,COMMA this work with emotions ,COMMA which are so fundamental ,COMMA then got us to thinking about :COLON Maybe the fundamental causes of human social networks are somehow encoded in our genes .PERIOD
Well ,COMMA the striking patterns of human social networks ,COMMA their ubiquity and their apparent purpose beg questions about whether we evolved to have human social networks in the first place ,COMMA and whether we evolved to form networks with a particular structure .PERIOD
And ,COMMA finally ,COMMA compare nodes C and D :COLON C and D both have six friends .PERIOD
But now we ,COMMA with a bird's eye view looking at this network ,COMMA can see that they occupy very different social worlds .PERIOD
So different structural locations have different implications for your life .PERIOD
They are a kind of social capital .PERIOD
New properties emerge because of our embeddedness in social networks ,COMMA and these properties inhere in the structure of the networks ,COMMA not just in the individuals within them .PERIOD
They're both made of carbon ,COMMA and yet one of them has carbon atoms in it that are arranged in one particular way -- on the left -- and you get graphite ,COMMA which is soft and dark .PERIOD
If I was always violent towards you or gave you misinformation or made you sad or infected you with deadly germs ,COMMA you would cut the ties to me ,COMMA and the network would disintegrate .PERIOD
I'd never seen anything like that .PERIOD
But after seeing what I've seen ,COMMA the truth is ,COMMA they have not disappeared at all .PERIOD
And this is happening every day .PERIOD
And from these bedrooms and living rooms and garages ,COMMA with cheap webcams ,COMMA lies the world's great dancers of tomorrow .PERIOD
And you let it go ,COMMA and then right when you see the tail ,COMMA you grab it by the tail ,COMMA then you bring it back in .PERIOD
You know ,COMMA you create power ,COMMA then you tame it .PERIOD
According to the treaty ,COMMA those lands are a sovereign nation .PERIOD
1868 :COLON The second Fort Laramie Treaty clearly guarantees the sovereignty of the Great Sioux Nation and the Lakotas' ownership of the sacred Black Hills .PERIOD
A new agreement was presented to Sioux chiefs and their leading men under a campaign known as sell or starve :COLON Sign the paper ,COMMA or no food for your tribe .PERIOD
Reservations are cut up into 160 -acre sections and distributed to individual Indians with the surplus disposed of .PERIOD
Tribes lost millions of acres .PERIOD
To this day ,COMMA this is the most Medals of Honor ever awarded for a single battle .PERIOD
Unemployment on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation fluctuates between 85 and 90 percent .PERIOD
This is how we came to own these United States .PERIOD
And how much of this history do you need to own ,COMMA even ?QUESTIONMARK
Because the solution seems so far in the past ,COMMA I needed nothing short of a time machine to access them .PERIOD
That's why there's a glass of water up there .PERIOD
This solution has been called ,COMMA by some ,COMMA potentially the most important medical advance this century .PERIOD
And what it was was oral rehydration salts .PERIOD
Maybe there's a biological answer .PERIOD
See ,COMMA we spent a lot of energy ,COMMA in many domains -- technological ,COMMA scientific ,COMMA hard work ,COMMA creativity ,COMMA human ingenuity -- to crack important social problems with technology solutions .PERIOD
Here I have a bunch of other examples ,COMMA all suffer from the last mile problem .PERIOD
The last mile is ,COMMA everywhere ,COMMA problematic .PERIOD
The problem is this little three-pound machine that's behind your eyes and between your ears .PERIOD
They do lots of inconsistent things .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA diarrhea's interesting because it's been around for thousands of years ,COMMA ever since humankind really lived side by side enough to have really polluted water .PERIOD
So ,COMMA think of the mental model that goes behind reducing the intake .PERIOD
So ,COMMA here you all are ,COMMA ostensibly educated people .PERIOD
Most of you look smart .PERIOD
I think we've learned the answer to that here .PERIOD
Almost out of kindergarten .PERIOD
These models ,COMMA like the leaky bucket ,COMMA work well in most situations .PERIOD
They are situations where the mental model doesn't match the reality .PERIOD
So now ,COMMA while you're thinking about that let's move to a second task .PERIOD
Fifty versus 35 ,COMMA that's a big move .PERIOD Eleven versus nine ?QUESTIONMARK Come on .PERIOD
So far ,COMMA I've been pretty negative .PERIOD
You just gotta carry this thing around .PERIOD
Here's another example of this .PERIOD
This is from a company called Positive Energy .PERIOD
And what they find is just this letter ,COMMA nothing else ,COMMA has a two to three percent reduction in electricity use .PERIOD
We have testing ,COMMA we go to the lab ,COMMA we try it again ,COMMA we have refinement .PERIOD
So ,COMMA this whole area is so fascinating .PERIOD
How you take your insights here and actually get them integrated into working business models on the ground ,COMMA in Indian villages ,COMMA for example ?QUESTIONMARK
We work closely with companies that have operational capacity ,COMMA or nonprofits that have operational capacity .PERIOD
If you have biological problems we try and fix it ,COMMA see if it works ,COMMA and then work the scale .PERIOD
When the magazine -- actually ,COMMA when I got the subscription -- it was 12 following pages .PERIOD

If you're the fastest of everyone we're testing here today ,COMMA you get 20 dollars .PERIOD
But for a lot of tasks ,COMMA they actually either don't work or ,COMMA often ,COMMA they do harm .PERIOD
If you look at the science ,COMMA there is a mismatch between what science knows and what business does .PERIOD
But for 21 st century tasks ,COMMA that mechanistic ,COMMA reward-and-punishment approach doesn't work ,COMMA often doesn't work ,COMMA and often does harm .PERIOD
Same deal .PERIOD You :COLON we're timing for norms .PERIOD
Low-cost providers around the world can do it cheaper .PERIOD
The rules are mystifying .PERIOD
Okay ?QUESTIONMARK But one the task called for even rudimentary cognitive skill ,COMMA a larger reward led to poorer performance .PERIOD
People offered the medium level of rewards did no better than people offered the small rewards .PERIOD
In eight of the nine tasks we examined across three experiments ,COMMA higher incentives led to worse performance .PERIOD
Last month ,COMMA just last month ,COMMA economists at LSE looked at 51 studies of pay-for-performance plans ,COMMA inside of companies .PERIOD
There is a mismatch between what science knows and what business does .PERIOD
Purpose :COLON the yearning to do what we do in the service of something larger than ourselves .PERIOD
Traditional notions of management are great if you want compliance .PERIOD
A few times a year they tell their engineers ,COMMA Go for the next 24 hours and work on anything you want ,COMMA as long as it's not part of your regular job .PERIOD

Autonomy ,COMMA mastery and purpose ,COMMA versus carrot and sticks .PERIOD And who wins ?QUESTIONMARK
Three :COLON The secret to high performance isn't rewards and punishments ,COMMA but that unseen intrinsic drive -- the drive to do things for their own sake .PERIOD
So this ,COMMA again ,COMMA is on the subject -- a slice from the equator of the Earth .PERIOD
It turns once per day in synchrony with the Earth .PERIOD
This would be grown ,COMMA I suppose ,COMMA with nanotechnology in the future sometime .PERIOD
So if we could roll the next film here .PERIOD

Now ,COMMA either he is senile ,COMMA and doesn't remember his own music ,COMMA because he wrote the music .PERIOD
So ,COMMA no ,COMMA he doesn't want that .PERIOD That's a different kind of control .PERIOD
Once like a Muti ,COMMA and you'll -- -- clap ,COMMA just once .PERIOD
And then like Karajan .PERIOD Let's see what happens .PERIOD Okay ?QUESTIONMARK
And when Karajan is asked about it he actually says ,COMMA Yes ,COMMA the worst damage I can do to my orchestra is to give them a clear instruction .PERIOD
Well ,COMMA it is different .PERIOD But isn't that controlling in the same way ?QUESTIONMARK
Look at the eyes .PERIOD
And you're playing a painful sound .PERIOD
Now it's a reversed thing .PERIOD You're telling the story .PERIOD And you're telling the story .PERIOD
But all my work for many years was focused around the idea that sustainability means basically looking at the globalized economic growth model ,COMMA and moderating what comes in at one end ,COMMA and moderating the outputs at the other end .PERIOD
If you could help me with that it would be fantastic .PERIOD
It's open source .PERIOD It's something which everybody who's involved with it develops and passes on as they work with it .PERIOD
It's self-organizing .PERIOD There is no great central organization that pushes this ;SEMICOLON people just pick up an idea and they run with it ,COMMA and they implement it where they are .PERIOD
And it's really about how systems ,COMMA settlements ,COMMA withstand shock from the outside .PERIOD
When our supermarkets have only two or three days' worth of food in them at any one time ,COMMA often sustainability tends to focus on the energy efficiency of the freezers and on the packaging that the lettuces are wrapped up in .PERIOD
It's a process which is playful and creative and informative .PERIOD
And there are thousands of others who are at what we call the mulling stage .PERIOD
A lot of places are working with their local schools .PERIOD
And also starting to play around with the idea of alternative currencies .PERIOD
And we see it all over the place as well now .PERIOD
This is probably the most boring topic of the whole morning .PERIOD
Many of the people involved have special interests or short-term interests that get them not thinking about what the implications of the trends are .PERIOD
Now how did we get here ?QUESTIONMARK
They make you pay more in withholding just to help their cash flow out .PERIOD
And California's not unique .PERIOD
There's ways ,COMMA if it's temporary ,COMMA to minimize the impact ,COMMA but it's a problem .PERIOD
Well you have to allocate dollars for that system and for that incentive pay .PERIOD
Well there really is no brain trust .PERIOD
So what do we need to do ?QUESTIONMARK
Whenever they say there's these long-term problems ,COMMA we can't say ,COMMA Oh ,COMMA you're the messenger with bad news ?QUESTIONMARK
Now I think this is a solvable problem .PERIOD
What do I know that would cause me ,COMMA a reticent ,COMMA Midwestern scientist ,COMMA to get myself arrested in front of the White House protesting ?QUESTIONMARK

British physicist John Tyndall ,COMMA in the 1850 's ,COMMA made laboratory measurements of the infrared radiation ,COMMA which is heat .PERIOD
Most of the things mentioned in our 1981 paper were facts .PERIOD
I had the privilege to speak twice to the president's climate task force .PERIOD
Let me describe the most important conclusion from the physics -- first ,COMMA from Earth's energy balance and ,COMMA second ,COMMA from Earth's climate history .PERIOD
Now finally ,COMMA we can measure Earth's energy imbalance precisely by measuring the heat content in Earth's heat reservoirs .PERIOD
The biggest reservoir ,COMMA the ocean ,COMMA was the least well measured ,COMMA until more than 3000 Argo floats were distributed around the world's ocean .PERIOD
Yet ,COMMA there was more energy coming in than going out .PERIOD
These curves for global temperature ,COMMA atmospheric CO 2 and sea level were derived from ocean cores and Antarctic ice cores ,COMMA from ocean sediments and snowflakes that piled up year after year over 800000 years forming a two-mile thick ice sheet .PERIOD
And more CO 2 causes more warming .PERIOD
So CO 2 ,COMMA methane ,COMMA and ice sheets were feedbacks that amplified global temperature change causing these ancient climate oscillations to be huge ,COMMA even though the climate change was initiated by a very weak forcing .PERIOD
And the rate has accelerated since the measurements began nine years ago .PERIOD
Ice sheets would continue to disintegrate for centuries .PERIOD
What may be more reprehensible ,COMMA if climate denial continues ,COMMA is extermination of species .PERIOD
An important impact ,COMMA if global warming continues ,COMMA will be on the breadbasket of our nation and the world ,COMMA the Midwest and Great Plains ,COMMA which are expected to become prone to extreme droughts ,COMMA worse than the Dust Bowl ,COMMA within just a few decades ,COMMA if we let global warming continue .PERIOD
I need your help to communicate the gravity and the urgency of this situation and its solutions more effectively .PERIOD

What I'd like to do first is take you through a very brief helicopter ride of stunts and the stunts industry in the movies and in television ,COMMA and show you how technology has started to interface with the physical skills of the stunt performer in a way that makes the stunts bigger and actually makes them safer than they've ever been before .PERIOD

I think I was supposed to talk about my new book ,COMMA which is called Blink ,COMMA and it's about snap judgments and first impressions .PERIOD
So I decided instead ,COMMA I would talk about someone who I think has done as much to make Americans happy as perhaps anyone over the last 20 years ,COMMA a man who is a great personal hero of mine :COLON someone by the name of Howard Moskowitz ,COMMA who is most famous for reinventing spaghetti sauce .PERIOD
And one of his first clients was -- this is many years ago ,COMMA back in the early ' 70 s -- one of his first clients was Pepsi .PERIOD
We'd like you to figure out how much aspartame we should put in each can of Diet Pepsi ,COMMA in order to have the perfect drink .PERIOD Right ?QUESTIONMARK

Why could we not make sense of this experiment with Diet Pepsi ?QUESTIONMARK
This was his horseradish .PERIOD He was obsessed with it !EXCLAMATIONMARK
You'd have a plate of spaghetti ,COMMA and you would pour it on ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK
And of those three facts ,COMMA the third one was the most significant ,COMMA because at the time ,COMMA in the early 1980 s ,COMMA if you went to a supermarket ,COMMA you would not find extra-chunky spaghetti sauce .PERIOD
And Prego turned to Howard ,COMMA and they said ,COMMA You telling me that one third of Americans crave extra-chunky spaghetti sauce and yet no one is servicing their needs ?QUESTIONMARK And he said yes !EXCLAMATIONMARK

We lived under apartheid regime .PERIOD
And then ,COMMA in the same year ,COMMA we almost lost everything .PERIOD
With independence ,COMMA the whole approach of community getting involved was embraced by our new government .PERIOD
Three things that actually help to build on this foundation :COLON The very first one is honoring of tradition and being open to new ideas .PERIOD
And at this sacred fire ,COMMA the spirit of our ancestors speak through the headman and advise us where to get water ,COMMA where to get grazings ,COMMA and where to go and hunt .PERIOD
Transporting rhinos using helicopters I think is much easier than talking through a spirit that you can't see ,COMMA isn't it ?QUESTIONMARK
The other partners that we have got is business communities .PERIOD
And so far ,COMMA with the support of World Wildlife Fund ,COMMA we've been able to scale up the very small programs to national programs today .PERIOD
Namibia .PERIOD or Sesfontein was no more an isolated village somewhere ,COMMA hidden away in Namibia .PERIOD
What started as very small ,COMMA community rangers getting community involved ,COMMA has now grown into something that we call conservancies .PERIOD
In 2008 ,COMMA conservancy generated 57 million dollars .PERIOD
This is our new economy -- an economy based on the respect of our natural resources .PERIOD
You know that Africa is being affected by these viruses .PERIOD
There is great confusion when the two look at each other .PERIOD

It's a big undertaking .PERIOD I stand here before you tonight as an ambassador for my whole team .PERIOD
There's a lot of people working on this right now .PERIOD
If everybody in the developed world understood this graph ,COMMA and emblazoned it on the inside of their foreheads ,COMMA there would be no further societal argument about climate change because this is the story that counts .PERIOD
This is what one of our cameras saw over the course of a few months .PERIOD
That's the retreat of this glacier .PERIOD

Greenland took a little while to start reacting to the warming climate of the past century ,COMMA but it really started galloping along about 20 years ago .PERIOD
Helicopter in front of the calving face for scale ,COMMA quickly dwarfed .PERIOD
It's flowing out to the Atlantic Ocean on the left .PERIOD
We just downloaded these pictures a couple weeks ago ,COMMA as you can see .PERIOD June 25 th ,COMMA monster calving events happened .PERIOD
Huge icebergs rolling over .PERIOD
So an illustration again ,COMMA gives you a feeling for scale .PERIOD
This is a terrific ,COMMA terrific call to arms to do the right thing for ourselves and for the future .PERIOD
Understanding all of this enables us to shift our perception of seafood away from a commodity to an opportunity to restore our ecosystem .PERIOD
Great for fishermen .PERIOD Lots of money .PERIOD Supporting local economies .PERIOD
So the first thing about this idea of restorative seafood is that it really takes into account our needs .PERIOD
And the best part is all of those ingredients are available to every family at the neighborhood Walmart .PERIOD
Forget nuclear holocaust ;SEMICOLON it's the fork that we have to worry about .PERIOD
People started buying appetizers and salads ,COMMA because they knew they weren't going to fill up on the entrees alone .PERIOD

The punch line ?QUESTIONMARK
And this is a song medley I put together -- Did you ever notice that four in the morning has become some sort of meme or shorthand ?QUESTIONMARK
A time for plotting to whack the chief of police ,COMMA like in this classic scene from The Godfather .PERIOD
It works a little something like -- this is a recent Google search for four in the morning .PERIOD

We can all picture astronauts in space .PERIOD
And in that space station we have the genetic material ,COMMA the chromosomes ,COMMA within a nucleus .PERIOD
And when that cellular space station is within the electric field ,COMMA it acts on those highly charged proteins and aligns them .PERIOD
What we saw in that trial is that that the life expectancies of both groups -- so the chemotherapy treated group and the Tumor Treating Field group -- was the same .PERIOD
Importantly ,COMMA it was the first time ever that the FDA included in their approval of an oncology treatment a quality of life claim .PERIOD
You can see that the black regions in the upper right quadrant are the areas where he had surgery .PERIOD

It's now five years since Robert's diagnosis ,COMMA and he's alive ,COMMA but importantly ,COMMA he's healthy and he's at work .PERIOD
I'm going to let him ,COMMA in this very short clip ,COMMA describe his impressions of the therapy in his own words .PERIOD
I'm going to show you another clip of a woman named Lydia .PERIOD
She underwent four different regimes of chemotherapy over two years ,COMMA none of which had an effect .PERIOD
Her cancer continued to grow .PERIOD
She's interacting with her kids and her grand kids .PERIOD
It's only the beginning .PERIOD
And I firmly believe that in the next 10 years Tumor Treating Fields will be a weapon available to doctors and patients for all of these most-difficult-to-treat solid tumors .PERIOD
And the water will go where it should go .PERIOD
And people made their house ,COMMA and the water storage tanks .PERIOD
This is near Jaipur .PERIOD This is called the Jaigarh Fort .PERIOD
It can break sometimes .PERIOD
It can envy many municipalities ,COMMA the color ,COMMA the taste ,COMMA the purity of this water .PERIOD
And people started renovating their own structures .PERIOD
Such a limited rainfall ,COMMA and highest colorful life flourished in these areas .PERIOD
But it is invisible .PERIOD
And then they will come and worship this pond ,COMMA pay respect ,COMMA their gratitude .PERIOD
And perhaps they knew the future also .PERIOD
How they maintain them ?QUESTIONMARK
Don't spit ,COMMA don't do anything wrong ,COMMA so that the clean water can be collected .PERIOD
If you climb these three ,COMMA six steps you will find something very nice .PERIOD
They say that a picture is worth a thousand words ,COMMA so we can say a thousand words right now ,COMMA an another thousand words .PERIOD
There were no English medium schools at that time ,COMMA even no Hindi schools ,COMMA [unclear] schools .PERIOD
but not to create the engineering colleges .PERIOD
So ,COMMA you can find through your Jeep ,COMMA a camel ,COMMA and a cart .PERIOD
Thank you very much .PERIOD
So ,COMMA the ponds ,COMMA the open bodies ,COMMA are everywhere ,COMMA right from Sri Lanka to Kashmir ,COMMA and in other parts also .PERIOD
And these [unclear] ,COMMA which stored water ,COMMA there are two type of things .PERIOD
It was never popular with many political leaders ,COMMA especially those in the United States who somehow thought that new media would be able to do what missiles couldn't .PERIOD
And they are building what I call the Spinternet .PERIOD
And police said that it happened because he was playing hide and seek ,COMMA which is elude the cat in Chinese slang ,COMMA with other inmates and hit his head against the wall ,COMMA which was not an explanation which sat well with many Chinese bloggers .PERIOD
So they immediately began posting a lot of critical comments .PERIOD
And this actually fits with another interesting theory about what's happening in authoritarian states and in their cyberspace .PERIOD
And first it's quite simple .PERIOD
So from this perspective ,COMMA having blogs and wikis produce knowledge has been great .PERIOD
So inviting people to all sorts of public forums ,COMMA having them participate in decision making ,COMMA it's actually great .PERIOD
And it's great simply because they can gather open source intelligence .PERIOD
I mean KGB ,COMMA and not just KGB ,COMMA used to torture in order to actually get this data .PERIOD
Now it's all available online .PERIOD
So what should we do about it ?QUESTIONMARK
Why are you crying ?QUESTIONMARK
No ,COMMA the boy said to me -- the boy said to me ,COMMA It would destroy me .PERIOD

So when I go in the room ,COMMA I close the door .PERIOD
Now I say this all with remorse ,COMMA and I was feeling a tremendous amount of remorse at that time ,COMMA but I was conflicted ,COMMA because ,COMMA while I was feeling remorse ,COMMA I was excited ,COMMA because I didn't get caught .PERIOD
I need you working with me and me working with you on how we raise our sons and teach them to be men -- that it's okay to not be dominating ,COMMA that it's okay to have feelings and emotions ,COMMA that it's okay to promote equality ,COMMA that it's okay to have women who are just friends and that's it ,COMMA that it's okay to be whole ,COMMA that my liberation as a man is tied to your liberation as a woman .PERIOD
Indeed ,COMMA what worries me is the entire notion of world leadership seems to me terribly archaic .PERIOD
It's redolent of James Bond movies and Kipling ballads .PERIOD
And in the information era we all live in today ,COMMA what we might call the TED age ,COMMA I'd say that countries are increasingly being judged by a global public that's been fed on an incessant diet of Internet news ,COMMA of televised images ,COMMA of cellphone videos ,COMMA of email gossip .PERIOD
We've been selling 15 million cellphones a month .PERIOD
They had to suspend functions at 830 .PERIOD
And they scrawled on the windshield in a reference to the show's heroine ,COMMA Tulsi Zindabad :COLON Long live Tulsi .PERIOD
In fact ,COMMA legend has is that when Doubting Thomas ,COMMA the Apostle ,COMMA Saint Thomas ,COMMA landed on the shores of Kerala ,COMMA my home state ,COMMA somewhere around 52 AD ,COMMA he was welcomed on shore by a flute-playing Jewish girl .PERIOD
But ,COMMA the fact is that the last elections ,COMMA five years ago ,COMMA gave the world extraordinary phenomenon of an election being won by a woman political leader of Italian origin and Roman Catholic faith ,COMMA Sonia Gandhi ,COMMA who then made way for a Sikh ,COMMA Mohan Singh ,COMMA to be sworn in as Prime Minister by a Muslim ,COMMA President Abdul Kalam ,COMMA in a country 81 percent Hindu .PERIOD
All the others have been all those three .PERIOD
In fact ,COMMA you can't even take the name of the country for granted ,COMMA because the name India comes from the river Indus ,COMMA which flows in Pakistan .PERIOD
It's the idea of an ever-ever-land ,COMMA emerging from an ancient civilization ,COMMA united by a shared history ,COMMA but sustained ,COMMA above all ,COMMA by pluralist democracy .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA that is the India that is emerging into the 21 st century .PERIOD
And ,COMMA I mean ,COMMA the world apparently is running out too .PERIOD
And trying to attach this to things that were themselves attached to certain specific target zones ,COMMA bacteria that we don't like .PERIOD
So you can find a little feature on a bacterium that you don't like ,COMMA like Staphylococcus -- I don't like it in particular ,COMMA because it killed a professor friend of mine last year .PERIOD
So this was pretty shocking to me ,COMMA that we could do this .PERIOD
And there's the very important thing there :COLON If you want to survive the cold ,COMMA you ought to be suspended .PERIOD Right ?QUESTIONMARK
The highest concentration is in our brains .PERIOD
And so ,COMMA we wanted to find out might we be able to use hydrogen sulfide in the presence of cold ,COMMA and we wanted to see whether we could reproduce this skier in a mammal .PERIOD
So ,COMMA we wondered :COLON Can we do anything useful with this capacity to control metabolic flexibility ?QUESTIONMARK
We ought to be able to lower supply to unprecedented low levels without killing the animal .PERIOD
And this company ,COMMA the first thing it did was make a liquid formulation of hydrogen sulfide an injectable form that we could put in and send it out to physician scientists all over the world who work on models of critical care medicine ,COMMA and the results are incredibly positive .PERIOD
And I should say that the concentrations of hydrogen sulfide required to get this benefit are low ,COMMA incredibly low .PERIOD
You don't want to be gorking people out just to save them ,COMMA it's really confusing .PERIOD
I’m going around the world giving talks about Darwin ,COMMA and usually what I’m talking about is Darwin’s strange inversion of reasoning .PERIOD
Exactly .PERIOD Exactly .PERIOD And it is a strange inversion .PERIOD
If you looked at glucose molecules till you were blind ,COMMA you wouldn’t see why they tasted sweet .PERIOD
And it’s a good thing that there isn’t ,COMMA because if there were ,COMMA then Mother Nature would have a problem :COLON How on earth do you get chimps to mate ?QUESTIONMARK
What we see with ,COMMA say ,COMMA chocolate cake is it’s a supernormal stimulus to tweak our design wiring .PERIOD
You’ve got 30 seconds ,COMMA you’d better be fast .PERIOD
Yes ,COMMA lot’s of laughter .PERIOD Yeah ,COMMA exactly .PERIOD
So we might have a wild idea ,COMMA but we’re afraid to share it with anybody else .PERIOD
They just quite happily show their masterpiece to whoever wants to look at it .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA that wasn’t just self-indulgence .PERIOD
It takes more than decor ,COMMA but I think we’ve all seen that creative companies do often have symbols in the workplace that remind people to be playful ,COMMA and that it’s a permissive environment .PERIOD
But why is it important ?QUESTIONMARK
We use it in a pretty pragmatic way ,COMMA to be honest .PERIOD
And you know ,COMMA the more creative of them might get to a really interesting example .PERIOD
So another one of Bob McKim’s favorite exercises is called the 30 Circles Test .PERIOD
Okay .PERIOD Put down your pencils ,COMMA as they say .PERIOD
15 ?QUESTIONMARK 20 ?QUESTIONMARK Anybody get all 30 ?QUESTIONMARK
I just wanted you to fill in as many circles as possible .PERIOD
We stop ourselves from doing things .PERIOD
I think the Eameses are wonderful examples of experimentation .PERIOD
They went from designing splints for wounded soldiers coming out of World War II and the Korean War ,COMMA I think ,COMMA and from this experiment they moved on to chairs .PERIOD
When play is about building a tower out of blocks ,COMMA the kid begins to learn a lot about towers .PERIOD
And as they repeatedly knock it down and start again ,COMMA learning is happening as a sort of by-product of play .PERIOD
So ,COMMA they learned their way to that by building prototypes .PERIOD
And all of a sudden a productive conversation was happening about design around a tangible object .PERIOD
The prototyping carts ,COMMA filled with colored paper and Play-Doh and glue sticks and stuff -- I mean ,COMMA they do have a bit of a kindergarten feel to them .PERIOD
But by giving project teams and the clients who they’re working with permission to think with their hands ,COMMA quite complex ideas can spring into life and go right through to execution much more easily .PERIOD
We’re doing the same thing as designers .PERIOD
So ,COMMA remember the sketching task we did at the beginning ?QUESTIONMARK
As designers ,COMMA we need to be able to transition in and out of play also .PERIOD
And it doesn't take long to go downhill .PERIOD
And I got distracted by it .PERIOD
And suddenly I was on the phone to my stockbroker and my real estate agent ,COMMA when I should have been talking to my clients .PERIOD
My partner and I ,COMMA Thom ,COMMA we had to let all our employees go .PERIOD
Because with no employees ,COMMA there was nobody for me to manage .PERIOD
And I grew up in this little farming town in northern Nevada .PERIOD
Britlin was so innocent and so sweet ,COMMA and her voice was so pure .PERIOD
And I had this idea :COLON if I could get 50 people to all do this same thing ,COMMA sing their parts -- soprano ,COMMA alto ,COMMA tenor and bass -- wherever they were in the world ,COMMA post their videos to YouTube ,COMMA we could cut it all together and create a virtual choir .PERIOD
And I sent out this call to singers .PERIOD
And I made free the download of the music to a piece that I had written in the year 2000 called Lux Aurumque ,COMMA which means light and gold .PERIOD
This is Evangelina Etienne from Massachusetts .PERIOD
I was told later ,COMMA and also by lots of singers who were involved in this ,COMMA that they sometimes recorded 50 or 60 different takes until they got just the right take -- they uploaded it .PERIOD
He scrubbed the audio .PERIOD
And then we posted this video to YouTube about a year and a half ago .PERIOD
We had a million hits in the first month and got a lot of attention for it .PERIOD
And there were 900 people involved in that .PERIOD
And we also put a page on Facebook for the singers to upload their testimonials ,COMMA what it was like for them ,COMMA their experience singing it .PERIOD
My sister and I used to sing in choirs together constantly .PERIOD
Me too .PERIOD
It is a dream come true to be part of this choir ,COMMA as I've never been part of one .PERIOD
And the second is that people seem to be experiencing an actual connection .PERIOD
It wasn't a virtual choir .PERIOD
But ,COMMA I know myself too ,COMMA I feel this virtual esprit de corps ,COMMA if you will ,COMMA with all of them .PERIOD
This is a recording I made of a mantis shrimp that's found off the coast of California .PERIOD
And mantis shrimp are called mantis shrimp after the praying mantises ,COMMA which also have a fast feeding appendage .PERIOD And I started to think ,COMMA well ,COMMA maybe it will be interesting ,COMMA while listening to their sounds ,COMMA to figure out how these animals generate very fast feeding strikes .PERIOD
So we got this incredible video system .PERIOD It's very new technology -- it just came out about a year ago -- that allows you to film at extremely high speeds in low light .PERIOD
And as you'll notice ,COMMA it's still pretty gosh darn fast slowed down 333 times .PERIOD It's an incredibly powerful movement .PERIOD
So what we calculated was that the limbs were moving at the peak speed ranging from 10 meters per second all the way up to 23 meters per second .PERIOD
It takes a long time for the muscle to contract ,COMMA and a very short time for the limb to fly out .PERIOD
There needs to be some kind of spring-loaded mechanism in order to generate the amount of force that we observe ,COMMA and the speed that we observe ,COMMA and the output of the system .PERIOD
The saddle-shaped structure is also known as a hyperbolic paraboloid surface ,COMMA or an anticlastic surface .PERIOD
In biological systems it's important not to have a whole lot of extra material requirements for building it .PERIOD
And so this is just a regular video of the animal just smashing the heck out of this load cell .PERIOD
And again ,COMMA I think this will be a world record .PERIOD
And what I'd like you to do in this shot is keep your eye on this ,COMMA on the surface of the load cell ,COMMA as the limb comes flying through .PERIOD
People have been struggling for years to try and design a very fast rotating boat propeller that doesn't cavitate and literally wear away the metal and put holes in it ,COMMA just like these pictures show .PERIOD
In fact ,COMMA you might have even seen some cavitation going up the edge of the limb .PERIOD
Very ,COMMA very convenient solution to that particular problem .PERIOD
And there's actually a spectacular colored dot in the center of the saddles of many species of stomatopods .PERIOD
And this is quite interesting ,COMMA to find evolutionary origins of visual signals on what's really ,COMMA in all species ,COMMA their spring .PERIOD
And so I'm very curious about whether those colored dots in the center of the saddles are conveying some kind of information about their ability to strike ,COMMA or their strike force ,COMMA and something about the time period in the molting cycle .PERIOD
We still have one foot in the dark ages .PERIOD
TS .PERIOD Eliot really said it for me -- and this should give you goose bumps :COLON we shall not cease from exploration and the end of our exploring shall be to return where we started and know the place for the first time .PERIOD
It’s a thin film ,COMMA two-dimensional existence .PERIOD
And if you hefted those two things you might find that the relative scale of those is 20 to 1 .PERIOD
It actually is a very good working sub -- that’s what it was designed for .PERIOD
A seat works in a two-dimensional world ,COMMA where gravity blasts down on that seat ,COMMA OK ?QUESTIONMARK
Most of life on earth is in that inner atmosphere .PERIOD
This is a three-dimensional machine .PERIOD
This is man’s first attempt at flying underwater .PERIOD
Chris asked us to show stuff that hasn’t been shown before .PERIOD
I’m trying to do everything very gently .PERIOD
This is the first flying machine .PERIOD This was the first prototype .PERIOD
There’re no silly buoyancy tanks -- it’s permanently ,COMMA positively buoyant .PERIOD
She’s just a few inches off the top of my head .PERIOD
And so ,COMMA how I see my work contributing is sort of trying to literally re-imagine these connections and physically rebuild them .PERIOD
So the era of big infrastructure is over .PERIOD
So ,COMMA albeit a very small creature and very modest ,COMMA this creature is incredible ,COMMA because it can agglomerate into these mega-reef structures .PERIOD
But you can see ,COMMA even just intuit ,COMMA from this map ,COMMA that the harbor has dredged and flattened ,COMMA and went from a rich ,COMMA three-dimensional mosaic to flat muck in really a matter of years .PERIOD
Now the Gowanus is particularly smelly -- I will admit it .PERIOD
When we started this project ,COMMA one of the core ideas was to look back in history and try to understand what was there .PERIOD
We also learned at this time that you could eat an oyster about the size of a dinner plate in the Gowanus Canal itself .PERIOD
It accepts algae and detritus in one end ,COMMA and through this beautiful ,COMMA glamorous set of stomach organs ,COMMA out the other end comes cleaner water .PERIOD
Basically ,COMMA New York was built on the backs of oystermen ,COMMA and our streets were literally built over oyster shells .PERIOD
What is fuzzy rope ,COMMA you ask ?QUESTIONMARK
So we imagine that we would actually potentially even host a bake sale to start our new project .PERIOD
So get your Tevas on .PERIOD
And then those spat are then seeded .PERIOD
And also showing oyster gardening for the community along its edges .PERIOD
And finally ,COMMA how much fun it would be to watch the flupsy parade and cheer on the oyster spats as they go down to the reef .PERIOD
So ,COMMA sorry -- it just feels like I should be doing stand-up up here because of the setting .PERIOD
Because if we get it out of the streets ,COMMA it'll smell much better ,COMMA and -- oh right ,COMMA we drink from the river .PERIOD
And he'd made the case in a number of papers and done a number of studies ,COMMA but nothing had really stuck .PERIOD
You can't really see it in this map ,COMMA but this is the map that becomes the central focus in the second half of my book .PERIOD
So it was this incredibly terrifying event .PERIOD
Just an extraordinary ,COMMA terrifying scene .PERIOD
And eventually Snow made a map of the outbreak .PERIOD
And he thought about representing that as a kind of a table of statistics of people living in different neighborhoods ,COMMA people who hadn't ,COMMA you know ,COMMA percentages of people who hadn't ,COMMA but eventually he hit upon the idea that what he needed was something that you could see .PERIOD
And so ,COMMA with the help of this map ,COMMA and with the help of more evangelizing that he did over the next few years and that Whitehead did ,COMMA eventually ,COMMA actually ,COMMA the authorities slowly started to come around .PERIOD
We don't worry that New York City is going to collapse in on itself quite the way that ,COMMA you know ,COMMA Rome did ,COMMA and be 10 percent of its size in 100 years or 200 years .PERIOD
His whole monastery was thrown into prison at the time of the uprising ,COMMA when the Dalai Lama had to leave Tibet .PERIOD
And it just so happened ,COMMA on the fifth week ,COMMA there was a public teaching by the Dalai Lama .PERIOD
I interview and do portraits .PERIOD
So this is our icon to non-violence in our world -- one of our living icons .PERIOD
This is Mengatoue .PERIOD
He's the shaman of the Huaorani ,COMMA and he said to us ,COMMA you know ,COMMA I'm an older man now ;SEMICOLON I'm getting tired ,COMMA you know ;SEMICOLON I'm tired of spearing these oil workers .PERIOD
And this kid lived in the village -- he wasn't there at the time -- and this is the little movie he put together about that .PERIOD
It's a question of what's the continuity ?QUESTIONMARK
We draw this set of nested spheres cut away so you see it .PERIOD
So if you take a picture of what's going on ,COMMA it's 10 years ago .PERIOD
And we go through a period of accelerating expansion ,COMMA and the universe expands and cools until it gets to the point where it becomes transparent ,COMMA then to the Dark Ages ,COMMA and then the first stars turn on ,COMMA and they evolve into galaxies ,COMMA and then later they get to the more expansive galaxies .PERIOD
I always think of space-time as being the real substance of space ,COMMA and the galaxies and the stars just like the foam on the ocean .PERIOD
And just put radially they're going out that way .PERIOD
What happens is ,COMMA you take pictures as the Earth rotates ,COMMA you get a fan across the sky .PERIOD
Do you see the fan-like scans made across the sky ?QUESTIONMARK
So again ,COMMA you can see the extension of this Great Wall of galaxies showing up here .PERIOD
And we had to add one more thing to make the universe come out right .PERIOD
So I'll show you the next movie .PERIOD
We're going to keep zooming in .PERIOD OK .PERIOD
And so I forgot to tell you the scale .PERIOD
So it takes light three billion years to travel over that distance .PERIOD
There's a very simple fluid to begin with .PERIOD
And so you know when you first saw this picture ,COMMA it didn't mean quite so much to you .PERIOD
Here you're looking across one percent of the volume of the visible universe and you're seeing billions of galaxies ,COMMA right ,COMMA and nodes ,COMMA but you realize they're not even the main structure .PERIOD
And we're going to fly around ,COMMA and we'll fly around ,COMMA and you'll see occasionally a couple of filaments intersect ,COMMA and you get a large cluster of galaxies .PERIOD
So the question is ,COMMA how hard would it be to assemble this ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK
And so here we are .PERIOD
This is how ,COMMA if you took billions of years to go around ,COMMA it might look to you ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK
And if you could see invisible matter ,COMMA too .PERIOD
We're going to start and realize that the entire visible universe ,COMMA everything we can see in every direction with the Hubble Space Telescope plus our other instruments ,COMMA was once in a region that was smaller than an atom .PERIOD
So I'm going to show you one that can be run on a desktop in two days in the next picture .PERIOD
And at that point ,COMMA the universe mysteriously starts accelerating its expansion and cuts off the formation of larger-scale structure .PERIOD
The fact is that we're living longer .PERIOD
It really involves many different areas .PERIOD
And that's where the field is today .PERIOD
We then grow the cells outside the body ,COMMA take the scaffold ,COMMA coat the scaffold with the cells -- the patient's own cells ,COMMA two different cell types .PERIOD
So the strategy here is -- this is actually a CT scan ,COMMA an X-ray -- and we go layer by layer ,COMMA using computerized morphometric imaging analysis and 3 D reconstruction to get right down to those patient's own kidneys .PERIOD
And this is actually a new technology we're working on now .PERIOD
I was able to do more things .PERIOD
Most of my professors were all for it ,COMMA and they said ,COMMA Bring pictures and show me the clips online ,COMMA and I'm happy for you .PERIOD
'I failed' He cried .PERIOD
One was -- never be late .PERIOD Never be late .PERIOD
That's what he tried to teach me and my brothers at one time .PERIOD
He spelled Moriarty with only one 'i' .PERIOD
You and I know deeper down ,COMMA there's always a chance to win the crown .PERIOD
Giving all ,COMMA it seems to me ,COMMA is not so far from victory .PERIOD
Don't whine .PERIOD Don't complain .PERIOD Don't make excuses .PERIOD
Not necessary to what you would want them to be ,COMMA but they will be about what they should ,COMMA and only you will know whether you can do that .PERIOD
I mention in my book ,COMMA They Call Me Coach .PERIOD
So they had qualities that -- they came close to -- as close to reaching possibly their full potential as any players I ever had .PERIOD
So in other words ,COMMA what's happening here is that Swaptree solves my carrying company's sugar rush problem ,COMMA a problem the economists call the coincidence of wants ,COMMA in approximately 60 seconds .PERIOD
So what's happening here ?QUESTIONMARK
We're bartering ,COMMA trading ,COMMA swapping ,COMMA sharing ,COMMA but they're being reinvented into dynamic and appealing forms .PERIOD
Over the next minute ,COMMA you're going to see a bit like a conceptual fireworks display of all the dots that went on in my head .PERIOD
I mean ,COMMA we're monkeys ,COMMA and we're born and bred to share and cooperate .PERIOD
And we were doing so for thousands of years ,COMMA whether it's when we hunted in packs ,COMMA or farmed in cooperatives ,COMMA before this big system called hyper-consumption came along and we built these fences and created out own little fiefdoms .PERIOD
They're growing up sharing -- files ,COMMA video games ,COMMA knowledge .PERIOD
Thomas Friedman is one of my favorite New York Times columnists ,COMMA and he poignantly commented that 2008 is when we hit a wall ,COMMA when Mother Nature and the market both said ,COMMA No more .PERIOD
The second is collaborative lifestyles .PERIOD
Just think of libraries and laundrettes .PERIOD
They are what I consider to be the cities of tomorrow ,COMMA the new urban world .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA why do I say that ?QUESTIONMARK
After we finished ,COMMA Armstrong straightened his tie ,COMMA put on a wool sports jacket ,COMMA and we headed out into the glare .PERIOD
I thought they might be playing King of the Hill ,COMMA but I was wrong .PERIOD
'It's a simple life ,COMMA but nobody is restricting you .PERIOD
Beer is a very important thing in Brazil .PERIOD
This here ,COMMA on the right-hand side ,COMMA is what's called a -- if you look at the fine print under the awning -- it's a hotel .PERIOD
And the second aspect is that once you have 2000 people in the community ,COMMA you can petition the government to be recognized as a legal sub-municipality .PERIOD
My family moved ;SEMICOLON we're nomads .PERIOD
But these two people worked something out .PERIOD
Right now ,COMMA those and other neurologic diseases -- for which we have no cure or prevention -- cost about a third of a trillion dollars a year .PERIOD
It will be well over a trillion dollars by 2050 .PERIOD
And the Avian Flu is also not a good idea .PERIOD
You should also keep your blood pressure down ,COMMA because chronic high blood pressure is the biggest single risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease .PERIOD
And of course ,COMMA when it comes to cognitive effects ,COMMA use it or lose it applies ,COMMA so you want to stay mentally stimulated .PERIOD
And one of the first things that I started to investigate was the history of the name of technology .PERIOD
And obviously ,COMMA technology had existed before then ,COMMA but we weren't aware of it ,COMMA and so it was sort of an awakening of this force in our life .PERIOD
And that's the very first use of the word .PERIOD
Even the hunter-gatherers used some elementary tools .PERIOD
So ,COMMA climate change is not a new thing .PERIOD
And flowers and plants are the same thing ,COMMA extended ,COMMA and technology is basically an extension of life .PERIOD
And the energy density that we see in the greatest of anywhere in the universe is actually in a PC chip .PERIOD
And there are things moving towards greater complexity ,COMMA moving towards greater diversity ,COMMA moving towards greater specialization ,COMMA sentience ,COMMA ubiquity and most important ,COMMA evolvability :COLON Those very same things are also present in technology .PERIOD
He could buy things that King Henry ,COMMA in all his wealth ,COMMA could never buy .PERIOD
And what I mean by that is that we find a new job for it .PERIOD
So ,COMMA better ideas is really -- always the response to technology that we don't like is basically ,COMMA better technology .PERIOD
And so ,COMMA every technology is sort of a creative force looking for the right job .PERIOD
And we are aware of the price .PERIOD
Great movement that is starting billions of years ago is moving through us and it continues to go ,COMMA and our choice ,COMMA so to speak ,COMMA in technology ,COMMA is really to align ourselves with this force much greater than ourselves .PERIOD
I really appreciate your attention today .PERIOD Thank you .PERIOD
Neil and I were sitting there comparing how little we've slept in anticipation for this .PERIOD I've never been so nervous -- and I do this when I'm nervous ,COMMA I just realized .PERIOD
In the Brooklyn neighborhood that I lived in ,COMMA Park Slope ,COMMA there are a lot of writers -- it's like a very high per capita ratio of writers to normal people .PERIOD
So when I moved back to San Francisco ,COMMA we rented this building .PERIOD
So we thought ,COMMA We'll have all these writers and editors and everybody -- sort of a writing community -- coming into the office every day anyway ,COMMA why don't we just open up the front of the building for students to come in there after school ,COMMA get extra help on their written homework ,COMMA so you have basically no border between these two communities ?QUESTIONMARK
And we looked around and somebody else said ,COMMA Well ,COMMA you should sell supplies to the working buccaneer .PERIOD
This is replacement eyes in case you lose one .PERIOD
While you're reading the sign ,COMMA we pull a rope behind the counter and eight mop heads drop on your head .PERIOD
It became mop heads .PERIOD And this is the fish theater ,COMMA which is just a saltwater tank with three seats ,COMMA and then right behind it we set up this space ,COMMA which was the tutoring center .PERIOD
And we thought ,COMMA Oh ,COMMA they're going to storm the gates ,COMMA they're gonna love it .PERIOD And they didn't .PERIOD
You know ,COMMA it's been proven that 35 to 40 hours a year with one-on-one attention ,COMMA a student can get one grade level higher .PERIOD
But there was something psychological happening there that was just a little bit different .PERIOD
They're allowed to go home at 530 pm ,COMMA enjoy their family ,COMMA enjoy other hobbies ,COMMA get outside ,COMMA play .PERIOD
Then we said ,COMMA Well ,COMMA what are we going to do with the space during the day ,COMMA because it has to be used before 230 pm ?QUESTIONMARK
So this is one of the books that they do .PERIOD
So ,COMMA meanwhile ,COMMA there's an adult in the back typing this up ,COMMA taking it completely seriously ,COMMA which blows their mind .PERIOD
It's right off the library .PERIOD And there we serve all 529 kids in this middle school .PERIOD
You can see Amy Tan sponsored the next one ,COMMA I Might Get Somewhere .PERIOD
We sell all the student books .PERIOD
They would say ,COMMA What is this ?QUESTIONMARK
So the store actually did really well .PERIOD
This is Sam Potts' great design that did this .PERIOD
This is a little vault -- you have to put your product in there ,COMMA it goes up an electric lift and then the guy behind the counter tells you that you have to recite the vow of heroism ,COMMA which you do ,COMMA if you want to buy anything .PERIOD And it limits ,COMMA really ,COMMA their sales .PERIOD
So then ,COMMA the secret door -- this is one of the shelves you don't see when you walk in ,COMMA but it slowly opens .PERIOD
This is one of the students ,COMMA Khaled Hamdan .PERIOD
Came in .PERIOD Got this concentrated attention .PERIOD
I'm going to switch to we ,COMMA and not I ,COMMA hope :COLON We hope that the attendees of this conference will usher in a new era of participation in our public schools .PERIOD
We hope that you will take the lead in partnering your innovative spirit and expertise with that of innovative educators in your community .PERIOD
Hot Studio did a great job in a very tight deadline .PERIOD So ,COMMA visit the site .PERIOD
I've been a priest in the Church for 20 years .PERIOD
Do we really believe that God is the kind of male boss that we've been presenting in our worship and in our liturgies over all these years ?QUESTIONMARK
Suggesting that God expresses Himself or Herself through powerlessness ,COMMA rather than power .PERIOD
Acknowledging that God is unknown and unknowable by definition .PERIOD
And this is what I said .PERIOD
And we want an explanation from God .PERIOD
For hundreds of years ,COMMA the prevailing orthodoxy ,COMMA the accepted truth ,COMMA was that God the Father ,COMMA the Creator ,COMMA is unchanging and therefore by definition cannot feel pain or sadness .PERIOD
And the devastating events of the 20 th century have forced people to question the cold ,COMMA unfeeling God .PERIOD
Who is God in all this ?QUESTIONMARK
Do we have a local God who can do little things like parking spaces ,COMMA but not big things like 500 mile-per-hour waves ?QUESTIONMARK
That's just not acceptable to intelligent Christians ,COMMA and we must acknowledge it .PERIOD
You probably heard some of them :COLON the man who surfed the wave ,COMMA the teenage girl who recognized the danger because she had just been learning about tsunamis at school .PERIOD
If we believe something like this ,COMMA we must let go of the puppet-master completely ,COMMA take our leave of the almighty controller ,COMMA abandon traditional models .PERIOD
Maybe God isn't an agent like all of us are agents .PERIOD
The people knew their God by His mighty acts .PERIOD
In the incredible intricacy and magnificence of the natural world .PERIOD
In the end ,COMMA we have to say ,COMMA I don't know .PERIOD
To have faith in this God would be more like trusting an essential benevolence in the universe ,COMMA and less like believing a system of doctrinal statements .PERIOD
And how would one deepen such a faith ?QUESTIONMARK
But in the end ,COMMA the only thing I could say for sure was ,COMMA I don't know ,COMMA and that just might be the most profoundly religious statement of all .PERIOD
It was deep at night .PERIOD
And I kept on staring at it until it disappeared .PERIOD
This is not a story of a nameless survivor of war ,COMMA and nameless refugees ,COMMA whose stereotypical images we see in our newspapers and our TV with tattered clothes ,COMMA dirty face ,COMMA scared eyes .PERIOD
War ,COMMA a friend of mine said ,COMMA is not about sound at all .PERIOD
It is actually about silence ,COMMA the silence of humanity .PERIOD
I have since left Iraq and founded a group called Women for Women International that ends up working with women survivors of wars .PERIOD
She said ,COMMA But it's not fair ,COMMA because there is only one life ,COMMA and there should only be one death .PERIOD
Ninety percent of modern war casualties are civilians .PERIOD
How interesting .PERIOD
There is a side that is led by men ,COMMA and there is a side that is led by women .PERIOD
There is no way we can talk about the building of stability if we don't start investing in women and girls .PERIOD
She got into Women for Women International's program .PERIOD
To start with ,COMMA these women that I told you about are dancing and singing every single day ,COMMA and if they can ,COMMA who are we not to dance ?QUESTIONMARK
By accepting this dichotomy ,COMMA whether it's tongue-in-cheek ,COMMA when we attempt to accommodate it in our world ,COMMA and we try to build our foundation for the world ,COMMA we're messing up the future ,COMMA because ,COMMA who wants to be uncreative ?QUESTIONMARK
Now I grew up in the ' 60 s and I'll admit it ,COMMA actually ,COMMA my childhood spanned the ' 60 s ,COMMA and I was a wannabe hippie and I always resented the fact that I wasn't really old enough to be a hippie .PERIOD
And I know there are people here ,COMMA the younger generation who want to be hippies ,COMMA but people talk about the ' 60 s all the time ,COMMA and they talk about the anarchy that was there ,COMMA but when I think about the ' 60 s ,COMMA what I took away from it was that there was hope for the future .PERIOD
You see ,COMMA I always assumed I would go into space ,COMMA because I followed all of this ,COMMA but I also loved the arts and sciences .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA my mother helped me figure that one out .PERIOD
But when I went into space ,COMMA when I went into space I carried a number of things up with me .PERIOD I carried a poster by Alvin Ailey ,COMMA which you can figure out now ,COMMA I love the dance company .PERIOD
And yeah ,COMMA sub-atomic physics is deconstructive .PERIOD You literally try to tear atoms apart to understand what's inside of them .PERIOD But sculpture ,COMMA from what I understand from great sculptors ,COMMA is deconstructive ,COMMA because you see a piece and you remove what doesn't need to be there .PERIOD
It's the universe ,COMMA as experienced by everyone ,COMMA and the arts manifest our desire ,COMMA our attempt to share or influence others through experiences that are peculiar to us as individuals .PERIOD
Do you know these books ,COMMA these such and such For Dummies ?QUESTIONMARK
But I was looking online at Amazoncom for other books like this .PERIOD
There's a sort of business model around being stupid in some sense .PERIOD
I was in Milan last week ,COMMA for the Italian launch .PERIOD
So it was traumatizing ,COMMA actually .PERIOD
Modernism means white box ,COMMA and it's a perfect white box .PERIOD
I have a default title as a father of a bunch of daughters .PERIOD
As a child ,COMMA we used to wake up at 1 am .PERIOD and work till 6 pm ,COMMA six days a week .PERIOD
Thank you .PERIOD
But the Media Lab is an interesting place ,COMMA and it's important to me because as a student ,COMMA I was a computer science undergrad ,COMMA and I discovered design later on in my life .PERIOD
And there was this person ,COMMA Muriel Cooper .PERIOD
It was the best advice I ever got .PERIOD So I went to art school ,COMMA because of her .PERIOD
I think that the mentors that we all meet sort of humanize us .PERIOD
So ,COMMA if you sort of compare that ,COMMA like this ,COMMA you'll see that computer versus human -- I've been tracking this for the last year -- computer versus human over the last year has changed .PERIOD
I spent my entire early career making complex stuff .PERIOD
Lots of complex stuff .PERIOD
This is a floral theme calendar in 1997 ,COMMA and this is a firework calendar .PERIOD So ,COMMA you launch the number into space ,COMMA because the Japanese believe that when you see fireworks ,COMMA you're cooler for some reason .PERIOD
I've been lucky to have been there before people made these kind of things ,COMMA and so I made all this kind of stuff that messes with your eyes .PERIOD
And eye meat is something different ,COMMA something more fibrous ,COMMA something more powerful ,COMMA perhaps .PERIOD But what could that be ,COMMA eye meat ?QUESTIONMARK
So ,COMMA I went back to the computer ,COMMA and I bought five large fries ,COMMA and scanned them all .PERIOD And I was looking for some kind of food theme ,COMMA and I wrote some software to automatically lay out french-fry images .PERIOD
And also ,COMMA as a child ,COMMA I was the fattest kid in class ,COMMA so I used to love Cheetos .PERIOD Oh ,COMMA I love Cheetos ,COMMA yummy .PERIOD
I discovered that Cheetos are good ,COMMA expressive material .PERIOD
It's a strange business model .PERIOD I can come into work everyday and staple five pieces of paper and just stare at it with my latte .PERIOD
In Japan ,COMMA they say that sushi is challenging .PERIOD
This book I wrote because I want to figure out life .PERIOD
He's an expert in aging .PERIOD This horizontal axis is how old you are -- twelve years old ,COMMA twenty-four years old ,COMMA seventy-four ,COMMA ninety-six years old -- and this is some medical data .PERIOD So ,COMMA brain strength increases up to 60 ,COMMA and then after 60 ,COMMA it sort of goes down .PERIOD Kind of depressing in a way .PERIOD
Your social responsibility is very interesting .PERIOD
How dare we be optimistic ?QUESTIONMARK
But ,COMMA as important as it is to change the lightbulbs ,COMMA it is more important to change the laws .PERIOD
And there are lots of those .PERIOD But the climate crisis is the rare but all-important global ,COMMA or strategic ,COMMA conflict .PERIOD
Greenland remains .PERIOD Twenty-eight years ago ,COMMA this is what the polar ice cap -- the North Polar ice cap -- looked like at the end of the summer ,COMMA at the fall equinox .PERIOD
This last fall ,COMMA I went to the Snow and Ice Data Center in Boulder ,COMMA Colorado ,COMMA and talked to the researchers here in Monterey at the Naval Postgraduate Laboratory .PERIOD
The North Polar ice cap is the same size geographically -- doesn't look quite the same size -- but it is exactly the same size as the United States ,COMMA minus an area roughly equal to the state of Arizona .PERIOD
They have exactly the same amount of carbon .PERIOD
What is missing is a sense of urgency .PERIOD
NBC -- I'll show all of the networks here -- the top journalists for NBC asked 956 questions in 2007 of the presidential candidates :COLON two of them were about the climate crisis .PERIOD ABC :COLON 844 questions ,COMMA two about the climate crisis .PERIOD
This is gasoline consumption in all of these countries .PERIOD And us .PERIOD
We have the technologies .PERIOD
We have to have a unified view of how to go about this :COLON the struggle against poverty in the world and the challenge of cutting wealthy country emissions ,COMMA all has a single ,COMMA very simple solution .PERIOD
But responses can actually make a huge difference in the poor countries .PERIOD This is a proposal that has been talked about a lot in Europe .PERIOD
Lot of other things contributed to it ,COMMA but the new Prime Minister announced that his very first priority would be to change Australia's position on Kyoto ,COMMA and he has .PERIOD Now ,COMMA they came to an awareness partly because of the horrible drought that they have had .PERIOD
But we have a planetary emergency .PERIOD
If we had just one week's worth of what we spend on the Iraq War ,COMMA we could be well on the way to solving this challenge .PERIOD
This challenge is part of the fabric of our whole civilization .PERIOD
Demand -- change the light bulbs ,COMMA but change the laws .PERIOD Change the global treaties .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA nobody is talking on that scale .PERIOD But I do believe that between now and November ,COMMA it is possible .PERIOD
In terms of your own personal role going forward ,COMMA Al ,COMMA is there something more than that you would like to be doing ?QUESTIONMARK
Al Gore ,COMMA thank you so much for coming to TED .PERIOD
And that's certainly how it seemed to me when I started this project .PERIOD
All this noise around us actually has information .PERIOD
So what I started thinking was ,COMMA perhaps there is something like open source intelligence here .PERIOD
So we started doing this .PERIOD And you can see here on the horizontal axis you've got the number of people killed in an attack or the size of the attack .PERIOD
You take all of the conflict ,COMMA all of the chaos ,COMMA all of the noise ,COMMA and out of that comes this precise mathematical distribution of the way attacks are ordered in this conflict .PERIOD
And we found that not only were the distributions these straight lines ,COMMA but the slope of these lines ,COMMA they clustered around this value of alpha equals 25 .PERIOD
And we could generate an equation that could predict the likelihood of an attack .PERIOD
This is data ,COMMA statistics .PERIOD What does it tell us about these conflicts ?QUESTIONMARK
Turns out we kind of do a reasonable job .PERIOD
So what's going on ?QUESTIONMARK
Why should these different -- seemingly different conflicts have the same patterns ?QUESTIONMARK
What does it look like ?QUESTIONMARK
We can push it up :COLON the forces become more fragmented ;SEMICOLON there is more of them ,COMMA but they are weaker .PERIOD
The opposite happened .PERIOD
The groups became stronger .PERIOD
But designers are great at taking big revolutions that happen and transforming them so that we can use them .PERIOD
You work over different time zones ,COMMA you talk to very different people ,COMMA you multitask .PERIOD We all know it ,COMMA and we do it kind of automatically .PERIOD
And all of a sudden scientists are seeking designers ,COMMA just like designers are seeking scientists .PERIOD
And Keith has come ,COMMA and also Jonathan has come and many others .PERIOD
And it was great ,COMMA because at the beginning was this apology fest -- you know ,COMMA scientists would tell designers ,COMMA you know ,COMMA I don't know what style is ,COMMA I'm not really elegant .PERIOD
Paul Steinhardt ,COMMA a physicist from New York ,COMMA and Aranda/Lasch ,COMMA architects ,COMMA collaborated in an installation in London at the Serpentine .PERIOD
I'm showing to you different sections of the show right now ,COMMA just to give you a taste of it .PERIOD
In this case I'm showing more the designers' work ,COMMA because they're the ones that have really been stimulated .PERIOD
But the problem is that it's a really ugly patty .PERIOD
When you don't have to kill cows and it can have any shape ,COMMA what should it be like ?QUESTIONMARK
One of the most important topics of the show -- you know ,COMMA as anything in our life today ,COMMA we can look at it from many ,COMMA many different viewpoints ,COMMA and at different levels .PERIOD
One of the most interesting and most important concepts is the idea of scale .PERIOD We change scale very often :COLON we change resolution of screens ,COMMA and we're not really fazed by it ,COMMA we do it very comfortably .PERIOD
You can be in the subway and you can be completely isolated and have your own room in your iPod .PERIOD
Again ,COMMA this communal sense of experience that seems to be so important today .PERIOD
And so this student at the RCA designed this beautiful blown-glass object where the bees move from one chamber to the other if they detect that particular smell that signifies ,COMMA in this case ,COMMA pregnancy .PERIOD
Design for Debate is a very interesting new endeavor that designers have really shaped for themselves .PERIOD
And usually they are accompanied by videos .PERIOD
It's quite amazing how these things can make you smile ,COMMA can make you laugh ,COMMA can make you cry sometimes .PERIOD
Thank you very much .PERIOD
The only trouble is the people next door ;SEMICOLON I can't stand them .PERIOD
And yet ,COMMA if I just allowed myself to be overwhelmed by these feelings ,COMMA I wouldn't be doing my job -- because I have to actually be there for them and make sure that rituals happen ,COMMA that practicalities are seen to .PERIOD
Who cannot be touched by compassion when we see the terrible horrors of the results of war ,COMMA or famine ,COMMA or earthquakes ,COMMA or tsunamis ?QUESTIONMARK
And ,COMMA of course ,COMMA you can't do that unless you understand yourself a bit more .PERIOD
Therefore ,COMMA there should be justice throughout the world .PERIOD
So ,COMMA like Snoopy ,COMMA we can't just lie there and think great thoughts about our neighbors .PERIOD
There has to be a willingness to do good deeds ,COMMA but not ,COMMA of course ,COMMA at the expense of our own sanity .PERIOD
What does this compassion entail ?QUESTIONMARK
And ,COMMA as many people do ,COMMA he was dozing off during the sermon .PERIOD
And he rushed home .PERIOD And after the Sabbath ,COMMA he made 12 loaves of bread ,COMMA took them to the synagogue ,COMMA went into the synagogue ,COMMA opened the ark and said ,COMMA God ,COMMA I don't know why you want this bread ,COMMA but here you are .PERIOD
And he called the two of them to his office .PERIOD
You mean God didn't want my bread ?QUESTIONMARK
And the rabbi said ,COMMA You've misunderstood me .PERIOD
You've misunderstood totally ,COMMA he said .PERIOD
Please keep your seat .PERIOD
Wrap it in an ACE bandage ,COMMA take some ibuprofen for a week or two ,COMMA and that's the end of the story .PERIOD
How can the nervous system get this so wrong ?QUESTIONMARK
In your house ,COMMA wires run in the wall ,COMMA from the light switch to a junction box in the ceiling and from the junction box to the light bulb .PERIOD
It's almost as if somebody came into your home and rewired your walls so that the next time you turned on the light switch ,COMMA the toilet flushed three doors down ,COMMA or your dishwasher went on ,COMMA or your computer monitor turned off .PERIOD
If you look out your window and you can see Long's Peak ,COMMA you're probably familiar with it .PERIOD
Take Meeker ,COMMA Mt .PERIOD Meeker .PERIOD Lump that in there ,COMMA and put that in space as well ,COMMA and Mt .PERIOD Everest ,COMMA and K 2 ,COMMA and the Indian peaks .PERIOD
Because back then ,COMMA video cameras were just starting to become popular ,COMMA and people would bring them ,COMMA parents would bring them ,COMMA to their kids' football games to film their kids play football .PERIOD And since this came in on a Friday ,COMMA they were able to get this great footage of this thing breaking up as it came in over West Virgina ,COMMA Maryland ,COMMA Pennsylvania and New Jersey until it did that to a car in New York .PERIOD
This did a huge amount of damage .PERIOD
The one over Tunguska was probably made of rock ,COMMA and that's much more crumbly ,COMMA so it blew up in the air .PERIOD Either way ,COMMA these are tremendous explosions ,COMMA 20 megatons .PERIOD
I don't think Apophis is a problem .PERIOD
In fact ,COMMA Apophis is a blessing in disguise ,COMMA because it woke us up to the dangers of these things .PERIOD
Well ,COMMA let me ask you ,COMMA what happens if you're standing in the middle of the road and a car's headed for you ?QUESTIONMARK What do you do ?QUESTIONMARK You do this .PERIOD
I think even NASA can do that ,COMMA and they proved that they can .PERIOD
After the big macho Rrrrrrr BAM !EXCLAMATIONMARK We're gonna hit this thing in the face ,COMMA then we bring in the velvet gloves .PERIOD
There's a group of scientists and engineers and astronauts and they call themselves The B 612 Foundation .PERIOD For those of you who've read The Little Prince ,COMMA you understand that reference ,COMMA I hope .PERIOD The little prince who lived on an asteroid ,COMMA it was called B 612 .PERIOD
So think about this ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK
Now those of you who are lucky enough to live in those societies that represent 17 percent ,COMMA I think should enjoy it until it lasts .PERIOD
My story starts -- the story I want to share -- starts in 1991 .PERIOD
The problem was that we had to re-tape that history a week later ;SEMICOLON because if we did not ,COMMA we could not afford enough tapes to keep archives of that history .PERIOD
So here we are having our first client ,COMMA brilliant .PERIOD
It's a kind of very nice ,COMMA sophisticated way how to economically strangle a daily newspaper .PERIOD
And we said ,COMMA that's fine ;SEMICOLON let's meet ;SEMICOLON you'll bring us your business plan ,COMMA which eventually they did .PERIOD
We start the meeting .PERIOD
But however you put it ,COMMA you know ,COMMA the numbers do not make any sense .PERIOD
We were the best that they could do .PERIOD
We do it in 17 countries of the developing world .PERIOD
So what the governor got was an empty shell .PERIOD
So from that perspective ,COMMA what we did is just really one drop in the sea of that need that we can identify .PERIOD
Imagine two thirds over here running excellent organizations ,COMMA doing very important work .PERIOD
Now imagine that every second person over here is deaf ,COMMA does not hear ,COMMA and switch the lights off .PERIOD
So we thought that some kind of a big idea is needed to reform ,COMMA to totally rethink fundraising .PERIOD
And then two weeks later ,COMMA Iqbal Quadir can issue his electricity in Bangladesh bonds .PERIOD
So ,COMMA indeed ,COMMA I have spent my life looking into the lives of presidents who are no longer alive .PERIOD
So since I tell stories ,COMMA let me look back on the lives of two of the presidents I've studied to illustrate this point -- Abraham Lincoln and Lyndon Johnson .PERIOD
But he read books in every spare moment he could find .PERIOD
Three things had combined to lay him low .PERIOD
He was so depressed that friends worried he was suicidal .PERIOD
And his great friend Speed went to his side and said ,COMMA Lincoln ,COMMA you must rally or you will die .PERIOD
And with a beauty of language -- almost as if the Shakespeare and the poetry he had so loved as a child had worked their way into his very soul .PERIOD
Knowing that Tolstoy was in their midst ,COMMA they asked him to tell stories of the great men of history .PERIOD
But instead ,COMMA surprisingly ,COMMA he said ,COMMA Oh ,COMMA bring her down here for a year ,COMMA and if I can't win her over ,COMMA no one can .PERIOD
But they were great ,COMMA nonetheless .PERIOD
But I also worried that part of it was that I was then a young woman .PERIOD
And there was wine and cheese and a red-checked tablecloth -- all the romantic trappings .PERIOD
And the British people were still upset about losing the Revolution ,COMMA so they decided to embarrass him a little bit by putting a huge picture of General Washington in the only outhouse ,COMMA where he'd have to encounter it .PERIOD
Which allows me ,COMMA from the beginning of spring training to the end of the fall ,COMMA to have something to occupy my mind and heart other than my work .PERIOD
But it so happened he was speaking in a Protestant Church .PERIOD
So I went to my father in tears ,COMMA What are we going to do ?QUESTIONMARK
I tried to sandwich it in between talking too much in church ,COMMA wishing harm to others ,COMMA being mean to my sisters .PERIOD
Well ,COMMA here's an example from my own experience .PERIOD
There are lots of people who believe that ,COMMA and I think it is utter baloney .PERIOD
I think that's the main point to be made .PERIOD
And I won't go into a lot of stuff about quantum mechanics and what it's like ,COMMA and so on .PERIOD
There are even movies about it with a lot of wrong stuff .PERIOD
And in a lot of familiar cases ,COMMA they of course are .PERIOD
So it's not a theory of everything .PERIOD And in fact ,COMMA a huge amount of the information in the universe around us comes from those accidents ,COMMA and not just from the fundamental laws .PERIOD
You know what it means .PERIOD A circle ,COMMA for example ,COMMA is symmetric under rotations about the center of the circle .PERIOD
Maxwell's equations are of course symmetrical under rotations of all of space .PERIOD
The next -- second -- equation says that there is no magnetism other than that .PERIOD
So here we say ,COMMA again ,COMMA what we said before :COLON that each skin of the onion shows a similarity to the adjoining skins .PERIOD
And therefore it looks beautiful because we already know how to write it in a lovely ,COMMA concise way .PERIOD
Steps toward unification exhibit the simplicity .PERIOD
Symmetry exhibits the simplicity .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA who today would claim that as a mere conceit of the human mind ?QUESTIONMARK
They are what we call emergent properties .PERIOD
You don't need -- you don't need something more to get something more .PERIOD
Life can emerge from physics and chemistry ,COMMA plus a lot of accidents .PERIOD
The things we make have one supreme quality -- they live longer than us .PERIOD
We perish ,COMMA they survive ;SEMICOLON we have one life ,COMMA they have many lives ,COMMA and in each life they can mean different things .PERIOD
The central element ,COMMA still ,COMMA of the notion of return ,COMMA a central part of the life of Judaism .PERIOD
All of those are respected by Cyrus .PERIOD
It left a dream of the Middle East as a unit ,COMMA and a unit where people of different faiths could live together .PERIOD
For them ,COMMA of course ,COMMA it can't possibly by Marduk that made all this happen .PERIOD
And it's quite clear the cylinder is older than the text of Isaiah ,COMMA and yet ,COMMA Jehovah is speaking in words very similar to those used by Marduk .PERIOD
The state of Israel is setup ,COMMA and 50 years later ,COMMA in the late 60 s ,COMMA it's clear that Britain's role as the imperial power is over .PERIOD
It's shown being presented here ,COMMA put into its case by the director of the National Museum of Tehran ,COMMA one of the many women in Iran in very senior positions ,COMMA Mrs .PERIOD Ardakani .PERIOD
And it's the subject of a huge debate about what this cylinder means ,COMMA what Cyrus means ,COMMA but above all ,COMMA Cyrus as articulated through this cylinder -- Cyrus as the defender of the homeland ,COMMA the champion ,COMMA of course ,COMMA of Iranian identity and of the Iranian peoples ,COMMA tolerant of all faiths .PERIOD
Will Iran set free the people that the tyrants have enslaved and expropriated ?QUESTIONMARK
A replica of this is at the United Nations .PERIOD
But I think it's possible that the most powerful and the wisest voice of all of them may well be the voice of this mute thing ,COMMA the Cyrus cylinder .PERIOD
Making sense of those things is a very difficult thing to do .PERIOD
In fact ,COMMA I have got qualifications .PERIOD
So I started thinking about peace ,COMMA and I was obviously ,COMMA as I said to you ,COMMA very much moved by these images ,COMMA trying to make sense of that .PERIOD
Could I go and speak to older and wiser people who would tell me how they made sense of the things that are going on ?QUESTIONMARK
And that was when I had the idea .PERIOD
There was no day of global unity .PERIOD
And that's why we wanted it to be the 21 st of September as the date of peace .PERIOD
Could you give me a flight ?QUESTIONMARK Because we're going to go see him .PERIOD
And of course ,COMMA we went and saw him and it was amazing .PERIOD
And just staying in the moment with it was a beautiful thing and really empowering actually .PERIOD
And we were listening to everybody .PERIOD
and working with NGOs and building this case .PERIOD
I felt that I was presenting a case on behalf of the global community to try and create this day .PERIOD
And this young child who'd taken about an inch and a half out of her leg with no antiseptic ,COMMA and that young boy who was a child soldier ,COMMA who told me he'd killed people -- he was about 12 -- these things made me realize that this was not a film that I could just stop .PERIOD
If this is the only film that I ever make ,COMMA I'm going to document until this becomes a reality .PERIOD
The Costa Rican government and the British government had put forward to the United Nations General Assembly ,COMMA with 54 co-sponsors ,COMMA the idea of the first ever Ceasefire Nonviolence Day ,COMMA the 21 st of September ,COMMA as a fixed calendar date ,COMMA and it was unanimously adopted by every head of state in the world .PERIOD
And as I mentioned ,COMMA when it started ,COMMA we were at the Globe ,COMMA and there was no press .PERIOD
It's been created ;SEMICOLON nobody knows .PERIOD
But we have to continue this journey ,COMMA and we have to tell people ,COMMA and we have to prove it can work .PERIOD
And after lots and lots of meetings obviously ,COMMA I'm delighted that this man ,COMMA Ahmad Fawzi ,COMMA one of my heroes and mentors really ,COMMA he managed to get UNICEF involved .PERIOD
And I saw him because he was an actor ,COMMA I was an actor ,COMMA I had a connection to him ,COMMA because we needed to get to the press ,COMMA we needed this attraction ,COMMA we needed the media to be involved .PERIOD
Because if we start pumping it up a bit maybe more people would listen and there'd be more -- when we got into certain areas ,COMMA maybe there would be more people interested .PERIOD
I won't go into that .PERIOD
So Jude said ,COMMA Okay ,COMMA I'll do some statements for you .PERIOD
And I could sort of see a little look in his eye of interest .PERIOD
So these guys were absolutely crucial .PERIOD
This amazing woman ,COMMA Fatima Gailani ,COMMA was absolutely instrumental in what went on as she was the spokesperson for the resistance against the Russians .PERIOD
And her Afghan network was just absolutely everywhere .PERIOD
We will observe this day .PERIOD
We see it as a window of opportunity .PERIOD
And so then we wrapped the film up and we put it together because we had to go back .PERIOD
And we wanted to go back and show them the film and say ,COMMA Look ,COMMA you guys made this possible .PERIOD And thank you very much .PERIOD
And I kept thinking about this 70 percent .PERIOD
70 percent reduction in violence -- in what everyone said was completely impossible and you couldn't do .PERIOD
He's an amazing man .PERIOD
It's all about the individuals .PERIOD
And it then made me think about a glass of water ,COMMA which is clear .PERIOD
Thank you very much .PERIOD Thank you .PERIOD
There was not a flashlight ,COMMA not a lantern ,COMMA not a candle -- pitch black .PERIOD
Anesthetic wears off .PERIOD The patient feels pain .PERIOD
And her recommendation is take this opportunity to fire everyone ,COMMA start all over again .PERIOD
Now what does this have to do with leadership ?QUESTIONMARK
They are the elite .PERIOD They are our leaders .PERIOD
And we need to train them right .PERIOD
And one day I go to the airport to meet my father ,COMMA and as I walk up this grassy slope from the car park to the terminal building ,COMMA I'm stopped by two soldiers wielding AK- 47 assault weapons .PERIOD
So a few years after this event ,COMMA I leave Ghana on a scholarship to go to Swarthmore College for my education .PERIOD
They wanted us to be analytical .PERIOD
They wanted us to be concerned about social issues .PERIOD
It was brilliant .PERIOD
Somebody trained them to do the work that they do .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA we cannot achieve perfection ,COMMA but if we reach for it ,COMMA then we can achieve excellence .PERIOD
I don't know ultimately what they will do .PERIOD
But the conversation they're having now -- about what their good society should look like ,COMMA what their excellent society should look like ,COMMA is a really good thing .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA I just wanted to leave that slide up because it's important that we think about it .PERIOD
I am even more thrilled by the fact that least year our student body elected a woman to be the head of Student Government .PERIOD
It's the first time in the history of Ghana that a woman has been elected head of Student Government at any university .PERIOD
It says a lot about her peers who elected her .PERIOD
My job is to make arms and legs -- well it's not completely true .PERIOD
And then ,COMMA not only for war victims ,COMMA but it was for any kind of patient .PERIOD
I was also working in the orthopedic center ,COMMA we call it .PERIOD
But it was a terrific job .PERIOD
So the orthopedic center was closed because physical rehabilitation was not considered a priority .PERIOD
Anyway ,COMMA you know every time I make this speech -- it's not the first time -- but it's an emotion .PERIOD
I wanted to go home .PERIOD I was driving .PERIOD
And everybody disappeared from the street .PERIOD
The man was without legs and only with one arm .PERIOD
And I ask ,COMMA What are you doing out in the street in this situation ?QUESTIONMARK
And then I said ,COMMA Oh ,COMMA my God .PERIOD What did I say ?QUESTIONMARK
He was coming every day ,COMMA crossing the front line .PERIOD
Two groups of Mujahideen started fighting .PERIOD
So we dashed ,COMMA all of us ,COMMA towards the shelter .PERIOD
Everybody was grabbing something .PERIOD
And I will never forget Mahmoud and his son walking together pushing the empty wheelchair .PERIOD
I don't want them to be teased at school by the other students .PERIOD
I said ,COMMA Okay .PERIOD
And then he sat down .PERIOD
So the only things I could manage to obtain was a kind of a compromise .PERIOD
I understood that I was wrong again .PERIOD
And then we started a new policy -- a new policy completely different .PERIOD
We decided to employ as many disabled as possible to train them in any possible job .PERIOD
I said ,COMMA No ,COMMA no ,COMMA no ,COMMA no ,COMMA we can't .PERIOD
And you should see me during the match .PERIOD
I shout like a true Italian .PERIOD
In this image of the Tokyo skyline ,COMMA I've hidden data from the newest planet-hunting space telescope on the block ,COMMA the Kepler Mission .PERIOD
There we go .PERIOD
And we can measure this very ,COMMA very precisely with Kepler and trace their effects .PERIOD
Wrong .PERIOD I'm not looking at you .PERIOD I can't see you .PERIOD
I have to do something now ,COMMA which seems a little bit strange for a magician .PERIOD
Oh ,COMMA they gladly sell you that ,COMMA yes .PERIOD
But the one thing that has made a big comeback just recently is this business of speaking with the dead .PERIOD
I don't think so ,COMMA because this subculture of people use exactly the same gimmicks that we magicians do ,COMMA exactly the same -- the same physical methods ,COMMA the same psychological methods -- and they effectively and profoundly deceive millions of people around the earth ,COMMA to their detriment .PERIOD
Good bye .PERIOD
The second question that I'd like to ask ,COMMA rather simple :COLON Suppose I ask them to contact the spirit of my deceased father-in-law ,COMMA as an example .PERIOD
Is this a hunting game ?QUESTIONMARK
But it is a cruel ,COMMA vicious ,COMMA absolutely conscienceless -- I'll be all right ,COMMA keep your seats -- game that these people play .PERIOD
Folks ,COMMA that's what dying is all about !EXCLAMATIONMARK
Now ,COMMA it may bring a certain amount of comfort ,COMMA but that comfort lasts only about 20 minutes or so .PERIOD
We all know who he is on television .PERIOD
He's well educated ,COMMA he's smart ,COMMA he knows what Sylvia Browne is doing but he doesn't give a damn .PERIOD
Because ,COMMA the bottom line is ,COMMA the sponsors love it ,COMMA and he will expose her to television publicity all the time .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA without that ,COMMA how could we possibly function ?QUESTIONMARK
She gives you the names of previous lives ,COMMA who you were in previous lives .PERIOD
Duh .PERIOD
Nothing is ever said about a 14 year-old bootblack in the streets of London who died of consumption .PERIOD
All the more reason to take the million dollars ,COMMA wouldn't you think ,COMMA Sylvia ?QUESTIONMARK
Why don't they affect me ?QUESTIONMARK
Now folks ,COMMA this is not just a metaphor I'm going to give you now ,COMMA it's true .PERIOD
And another claim that they make -- you'll love this one -- the more dilute the medicine is ,COMMA they say ,COMMA the more powerful it is .PERIOD
Largely ,COMMA it's the media who are to blame for this sort of thing .PERIOD
It's the bottom line ,COMMA the dollar line .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA we've offered this carrot ,COMMA as I say ,COMMA we've dangled the carrot .PERIOD
Ladies and gentlemen ,COMMA I'm James Randi ,COMMA and I'm waiting .PERIOD
And one of the major gaps in care ,COMMA almost across the board ,COMMA is access to safe surgery .PERIOD
In the background there is a very sophisticated anesthesia machine .PERIOD
In order to operate ,COMMA this machine needs a number of things that this hospital has to offer .PERIOD
And finally ,COMMA I think you can see that infrastructure is not very strong .PERIOD
Similarly compressed oxygen and other medical supplies are really a luxury and can often be out of stock for months or even a year .PERIOD
One of our partners at Johns Hopkins was observing surgeries in Sierra Leone about a year ago .PERIOD
And the first surgery of the day happened to be an obstetrical case .PERIOD
And everything began pretty auspiciously .PERIOD
My colleague ,COMMA Dr .PERIOD Paul Fenton ,COMMA was living this reality .PERIOD
He went to work every day in an operating theater like this one ,COMMA trying to deliver anesthesia and teach others how to do so using that same equipment that became so unreliable ,COMMA and frankly unsafe ,COMMA in his hospital .PERIOD
But this gives control to the provider ,COMMA whether there's power or not ,COMMA because they can adjust the flow based on the percentage of oxygen they see that they're giving their patient .PERIOD
This is in 13 hospitals in four countries ,COMMA and since 2010 ,COMMA we've done well over 2000 surgeries with no clinically adverse events .PERIOD
So we're thrilled .PERIOD
Because only once before has the fate of individual people and the fate of all of humanity been so intertwined .PERIOD
Maybe a few lung diseases here and there ,COMMA but ,COMMA you know ,COMMA that's not such a big deal .PERIOD
But back to animals and junk food .PERIOD
Two :COLON both have been marketed heavily ,COMMA creating unnatural demand .PERIOD
And they do this here .PERIOD It's the same deal .PERIOD
That's just the United States .PERIOD
There were no restaurant chains .PERIOD
Fats ,COMMA carbs ,COMMA proteins -- they weren't bad or good ,COMMA they were food .PERIOD
The South and West became agricultural hubs ,COMMA and in other parts of the country ,COMMA suburbs took over farmland .PERIOD
If we had a slide of Salisbury steak ,COMMA even more so ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK
Thanks to farm subsidies ,COMMA the fine collaboration between agribusiness and Congress ,COMMA soy ,COMMA corn and cattle became king .PERIOD
Not that they were any good ,COMMA but they were there .PERIOD
For dessert ,COMMA store-bought ice cream or cookies .PERIOD
So now ,COMMA you've got your pizza nights ,COMMA you've got your microwave nights ,COMMA you've got your grazing nights ,COMMA you've got your fend-for-yourself nights and so on .PERIOD
Meat ,COMMA junk food ,COMMA cheese :COLON the very stuff that will kill you .PERIOD
So ,COMMA now we clamor for organic food .PERIOD
I don't know .PERIOD
Ann Cooper's right .PERIOD
The USDA is not our ally here .PERIOD
Cruelty :COLON I knew that the 10 billion animals we raise each year for meat are raised in factory farm conditions that we ,COMMA hypocritically ,COMMA wouldn't even consider for our own cats ,COMMA dogs and other pets .PERIOD
So why was I stalling ?QUESTIONMARK
Best of all ,COMMA I'm healthier ,COMMA I know that I'm going to live longer ,COMMA and I've even lost a little weight .PERIOD
Thank you .PERIOD
Some of these have already been touched upon by other speakers ,COMMA which is encouraging .PERIOD
The first is -- death is a big problem .PERIOD
Sometimes ,COMMA we don't see a problem because either it's too familiar or it's too big .PERIOD
People like -- it's roughly the population in this room has just died .PERIOD
Suppose we approximated one person with one book ?QUESTIONMARK
So that's the first big problem .PERIOD
Well ,COMMA let's first look at the probability -- and this is very ,COMMA very difficult to estimate -- but there have been only four studies on this in recent years ,COMMA which is surprising .PERIOD
He estimated a probability that we will fail to survive the current century :COLON 50 percent .PERIOD
Another author doesn't give any numerical estimate ,COMMA but says the probability is significant that it will fail .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA if we think about what just reducing the probability of human extinction by just one percentage point -- not very much -- so that's equivalent to 60 million lives saved ,COMMA if we just count the currently living people ,COMMA the current generation .PERIOD
The only thing you should focus on would be to reduce existential risk because even the tiniest decrease in existential risk would just overwhelm any other benefit you could hope to achieve .PERIOD
And even if you just look at the current people ,COMMA and ignore the potential that would be lost if we went extinct ,COMMA it should still have a high priority .PERIOD
We were very successful .PERIOD
We might end up with something like this ,COMMA which is -- I mean ,COMMA it's a heck of a lot better than that .PERIOD
And they also all seem a little bit -- most people have this instinct that ,COMMA well ,COMMA sure ,COMMA there needs to be anti-depressants for the really depressed people .PERIOD
Intellectual capacity -- let's take that box ,COMMA which falls into a lot of different sub-categories :COLON memory ,COMMA concentration ,COMMA mental energy ,COMMA intelligence ,COMMA empathy .PERIOD
Able to switch back and forth more easily would be a neat thing to be able to do -- easier to achieve the flow state ,COMMA when you're totally immersed in something you are doing .PERIOD
If you could actually choose to preserve your romantic attachments to one person ,COMMA undiminished through time ,COMMA so that wouldn't have to -- love would never have to fade if you didn't want it to .PERIOD
Might be more complicated in humans ,COMMA but perhaps not that much .PERIOD
Well ,COMMA we know already that in this little human circle there ,COMMA there are these enormously wonderful and worthwhile modes of being -- human life at its best is wonderful .PERIOD
We have no reason to believe that within this much ,COMMA much larger space there would not also be extremely worthwhile modes of being ,COMMA perhaps ones that would be way beyond our wildest ability even to imagine or dream about .PERIOD
And so ,COMMA to fix this third problem ,COMMA I think we need -- slowly ,COMMA carefully ,COMMA with ethical wisdom and constraint -- develop the means that enable us to go out in this larger space and explore it and find the great values that might hide there .PERIOD
The sun end was about four inches in diameter ,COMMA and then it tapered over about 35 feet to about a millimeter at the Earth end .PERIOD
So I got it down to just one tether to be able to support that .PERIOD
So many forces there .PERIOD
If I throw a very concentric circle ,COMMA or concentric ellipse ,COMMA it just dutifully makes these evenly spaced lines ,COMMA which get closer and closer together ,COMMA which describes how gravity works .PERIOD
Because since it has the ability to make forms that look like forms that we're familiar with in biology ,COMMA it's also making other forms that we're not familiar with .PERIOD
Oh ,COMMA let's hope so .PERIOD Oh ,COMMA my God ,COMMA let's .PERIOD
And I think nature wants to express itself in the sense that we are nature ,COMMA humans are of the universe .PERIOD
And we are expressions of the universe ,COMMA basically .PERIOD
As humans ,COMMA ultimately being part of the universe ,COMMA we're kind of the spokespeople or the observer part of the constituency of the universe .PERIOD
And to interface with it ,COMMA with a device that lets these forces that are everywhere act and show what they can do ,COMMA giving them pigment and paint just like an artist ,COMMA it's a good ally .PERIOD
It's become an art form ,COMMA a form of sculpture .PERIOD
But even more importantly ,COMMA he created a language ,COMMA a way we could communicate ,COMMA a code of dots ,COMMA dashes and arrows .PERIOD
This is an origami figure -- one sheet ,COMMA no cuts ,COMMA folding only ,COMMA hundreds of folds .PERIOD
This ,COMMA too ,COMMA is origami ,COMMA and this shows where we've gone in the modern world .PERIOD
You can get horns ,COMMA antlers -- even ,COMMA if you look close ,COMMA cloven hooves .PERIOD
And what changed is something you might not have expected in an art ,COMMA which is math .PERIOD
I mean ,COMMA a stag beetle -- it's got two points for jaws ,COMMA it's got antennae .PERIOD Can you be that specific in the detail ?QUESTIONMARK
If I make the flaps skinnier ,COMMA I can use a bit less paper .PERIOD
And I can use those patterns now to create origami shapes .PERIOD
Do a little more complicated instrument .PERIOD
And he used it to design this solar array .PERIOD
The telescope ,COMMA going up in space ,COMMA it unfolds in two places .PERIOD
The design called for geosynchronous orbit 25000 miles up ,COMMA 100 -meter diameter lens .PERIOD
And rockets are small .PERIOD So you have to make it smaller .PERIOD
But this pattern's not going to work to get something 100 meters down to a few meters .PERIOD
And they want to do their design by simulation .PERIOD
And as weird and surprising as it may sound ,COMMA origami may someday even save a life .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA ecstasy in Greek meant simply to stand to the side of something .PERIOD
You can't understand more than two people talking to you .PERIOD
And it has become a kind of a truism in the study of creativity that you can't be creating anything with less than 10 years of technical-knowledge immersion in a particular field .PERIOD
Whether it's mathematics or music ,COMMA it takes that long to be able to begin to change something in a way that it's better than what was there before .PERIOD
You see that these people define success as something that helps others and at the same time makes you feel happy as you are working at it .PERIOD
The other combinations of challenge and skill become progressively less optimal .PERIOD
And that is the kind of challenge that we're trying to understand .PERIOD
Not a lot of women did .PERIOD
The ' 20 s and the ' 60 s also come to mind .PERIOD
This is really just about the facts of this economic moment that we live in .PERIOD
This second set of headlines -- you can see that families and marriages are starting to shift .PERIOD
And so they decided ,COMMA because they were intrigued by this finding ,COMMA to do a nationwide survey .PERIOD
So they spread out all the census data ,COMMA and what they found ,COMMA the guy described to me as a shocker ,COMMA which is that in 1997 out of 2000 communities ,COMMA women ,COMMA young women ,COMMA were making more money than young men .PERIOD
Watch what happens to the women .PERIOD Watch what happens to the men .PERIOD
It looks like women got some power boost on a video game ,COMMA or like they snuck in some secret serum into their birth-control pills that lets them shoot up high .PERIOD
What it's about is that the economy has changed a lot .PERIOD
So that's childcare ,COMMA elder care and food preparation .PERIOD
And some people say it's because ,COMMA in 9 th grade ,COMMA boys start dropping out of school .PERIOD
Basically ,COMMA the way they said it to me is that they would be working 18 hours a day ,COMMA that their husband would maybe have a job ,COMMA but that mostly he would be at home taking care of the kiddies .PERIOD
And this was kind of a shocker to me .PERIOD
They basically enshrined the second-class status of women in the civil code .PERIOD
For one thing ,COMMA it puts men and women in a really antagonistic relationship with one another ,COMMA because the men are these devious tricksters up there who've put up this glass ceiling .PERIOD
So the image that I like to think of ,COMMA instead of glass ceiling ,COMMA is the high bridge .PERIOD
There's no man or woman standing in the middle about to cut the cables .PERIOD
To the dismay of my mother ,COMMA this is dangerous teenage fashion right there .PERIOD
Really make a fully integrated product ,COMMA something beautiful .PERIOD
This baby is fully electric .PERIOD
All the projections [say that] this one [billion] will [only] grow with one to two or three percent .PERIOD
[But this second] grows with seven ,COMMA eight percent ,COMMA and then they will end up here .PERIOD
They will start flying .PERIOD
Because we already have this [growth] in process .PERIOD
The year is 1960 .PERIOD
Can you see ,COMMA as the years pass by ,COMMA child survival is increasing ?QUESTIONMARK
It's only by child survival that we will stop population growth .PERIOD
In the front ,COMMA you see ,COMMA actually ,COMMA Joe Murray getting the patient ready for the transplant ,COMMA while in the back room you see Hartwell Harrison ,COMMA the Chief of Urology at Harvard ,COMMA actually harvesting the kidney .PERIOD
That really has to do with our aging population .PERIOD
It's not really that foreign of a concept ,COMMA actually ;SEMICOLON it happens on the Earth every day .PERIOD
So ,COMMA your body is constantly regenerating .PERIOD
So ,COMMA how can we harness that power ?QUESTIONMARK
That's exactly what you see here .PERIOD
To the naked eye they look like a piece of your blouse ,COMMA or your shirt ,COMMA but actually these materials are fairly complex and they are designed to degrade once inside the body .PERIOD
It disintegrates a few months later .PERIOD
What about other structures ?QUESTIONMARK
This is actually an engineered blood vessel .PERIOD
You now have your fully seeded scaffold .PERIOD
We then take a scaffold that we shape like a bladder .PERIOD
We place it back into this oven-like device .PERIOD
So ,COMMA bladders are definitely a little bit more complex than the other structures .PERIOD
But there are other hollow organs that have added complexity to it .PERIOD
We exercise these prior to implantation .PERIOD
All we are left with is the skeleton ,COMMA if you will ,COMMA of the liver ,COMMA all made up of collagen ,COMMA a material that's in our bodies ,COMMA that will not reject .PERIOD
This is still experimental .PERIOD But we are able to actually reproduce the functionality of the liver structure ,COMMA experimentally .PERIOD
So ,COMMA another strategy we're following is actually to create wafers that we stack together ,COMMA like an accordion ,COMMA if you will .PERIOD
If at all possible ,COMMA we really would like to use smart biomaterials that we can just take off the shelf and regenerate your organs .PERIOD
Why ?QUESTIONMARK Because we'd rather take those cells which already know that those are the cell types you want .PERIOD
And we prefer cells that will not reject and will not form tumors .PERIOD
And we're working a lot with the stem cells that we published on two years ago ,COMMA stem cells from the amniotic fluid ,COMMA and the placenta ,COMMA which have those properties .PERIOD
So ,COMMA I always like to show this cartoon .PERIOD
And there you see the stagecoach driver ,COMMA and he goes ,COMMA on the top panel ,COMMA He goes A ,COMMA B ,COMMA C ,COMMA D ,COMMA E ,COMMA F .PERIOD
Entrepreneurs are people -- because we have a lot of them in this room -- who have these ideas and these passions or see these needs in the world and we decide to stand up and do it .PERIOD
And as a young kid ,COMMA nobody can say it can't happen because you're too dumb to realize that you couldn't figure it out .PERIOD
If we can teach our kids to become entrepreneurial -- the ones that show those traits to be -- like we teach the ones who have science gifts to go on in science ,COMMA what if we saw the ones who had entrepreneurial traits and taught them to be entrepreneurs ?QUESTIONMARK
We could actually have all these kids spreading businesses instead of waiting for government handouts .PERIOD
And the media says that it's really cool if we could go out and be a model or a singer or a sports hero like Luongo ,COMMA Crosby .PERIOD
Our MBA programs do not teach kids to be entrepreneurs .PERIOD
We didn't fit in the normal work .PERIOD We couldn't work for somebody else because we're too stubborn and we have all these other traits .PERIOD
I could go on and on .PERIOD
Fit into this other system and try to become a student .PERIOD
I'm also quoted -- and I told the person who wrote the textbook -- I'm now quoted in that exact same university textbook in every Canadian university and college studies .PERIOD
I open up chapter eight talking about budgeting .PERIOD
And I told the author ,COMMA after they did my interview ,COMMA that I cheated in that same course .PERIOD
And my mom came into the room and she said ,COMMA Where are you going to get the coat hangers to sell to the dry cleaners ?QUESTIONMARK
I'm like ,COMMA But you have two cars and they don't have license plate protectors .PERIOD
So I knew there were two cars with two license plates on each .PERIOD
But it was obvious to me ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK Buy low ,COMMA sell high .PERIOD
Don't try to sell to the poor kids ;SEMICOLON they don't have cash .PERIOD The rich people do .PERIOD Go get some .PERIOD
So that's obvious ,COMMA right .PERIOD
and making money off that too .PERIOD
I built these little pincushions when I was 11 years old in Cubs ,COMMA and we made these pin cushions for our moms for Mother's Day .PERIOD
And you'd make these chairs .PERIOD
You get the golf balls ,COMMA and you just throw them in your bathing suit trunks and when you're done you've got a couple hundred of them .PERIOD
And they could use those for practice balls .PERIOD
But it paid the bills .PERIOD
I remember being told to walk out in the middle of a street in Banff ,COMMA Alberta because I'd thrown a penny out in the street ,COMMA and my dad said ,COMMA Go pick it up .PERIOD
But then we negotiate on what they're going to get paid .PERIOD
You breed that kind of stuff .PERIOD Each of my kids has two piggy banks .PERIOD
The 50 percent that goes in their house account ,COMMA every six months ,COMMA goes to the bank .PERIOD
Just do that kind of stuff and have fun with it .PERIOD
We have all these lessons in front of us ,COMMA but we don't take those opportunities ;SEMICOLON we teach kids to go get a tutor .PERIOD
My kids love this stuff .PERIOD
It's a video that was done by one of the companies that I mentor .PERIOD
They were trying to figure out how to rebuild their universities .PERIOD
Since education under the Soviet Union was essentially propaganda serving the purposes of a state ideology ,COMMA they appreciated that it would take wholesale transformations if they were to provide an education worthy of free men and women .PERIOD
You may think you know what is going on in that Jane Austen novel -- that is ,COMMA until your first encounter with postmodern deconstructionism .PERIOD
When the astronomical distance between the realities of the academy and the visionary intensity of this challenge were more than enough ,COMMA I can assure you ,COMMA to give one pause ,COMMA what was happening outside higher education made backing off unthinkable .PERIOD
And that was only the beginning .PERIOD
Incredibly ,COMMA this nation ,COMMA with all its material ,COMMA intellectual and spiritual resources ,COMMA seems utterly helpless to reverse the freefall in any of these areas .PERIOD
We are playing with fire .PERIOD
On a more personal note ,COMMA this betrayal of our principles ,COMMA our decency ,COMMA our hope ,COMMA made it impossible for me to avoid the question ,COMMA What will I say ,COMMA years from now ,COMMA when people ask ,COMMA 'Where were you' As president of a leading liberal arts college ,COMMA famous for its innovative history ,COMMA there were no excuses .PERIOD
The challenge :COLON to figure out what it will take to actually do something that makes a significant and sustainable difference .PERIOD
Even more valuable ,COMMA history provides a laboratory in which we see played out the actual ,COMMA as well as the intended consequences of ideas .PERIOD
Students ,COMMA in turn ,COMMA continuously move outside the classroom to engage the world directly .PERIOD
This is a political education ,COMMA to be sure .PERIOD
The center will embody and sustain this new educational commitment .PERIOD
What is certain is that the individual talent exhibited in such abundance here ,COMMA needs to turn its attention to that collaborative ,COMMA messy ,COMMA frustrating ,COMMA contentious and impossible world of politics and public policy .PERIOD
All right .PERIOD Okay ,COMMA so .PERIOD perfect .PERIOD
They go to church ,COMMA by which I mean ,COMMA they do lots of things for free for each other .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA I know you don't believe me ,COMMA really ,COMMA here .PERIOD
He's a terrible producer of videos ,COMMA but it's great content ,COMMA so I'm going to give you a little bit of it .PERIOD
So here he is beginning .PERIOD
This is this fantastic Brat Pack remix set to Lisztomania .PERIOD
They decided they wanted to do the same .PERIOD
So that's importantly different from the earlier videos we looked at because here ,COMMA remix isn't just about an individual doing something alone in his basement ;SEMICOLON it becomes an act of social creativity .PERIOD
Indeed ,COMMA Mickey Mouse himself ,COMMA of course ,COMMA as Steamboat Willie ,COMMA is a remix of the then ,COMMA very dominant ,COMMA very popular Steamboat Bill by Buster Keaton .PERIOD
He is the celebration and ideal of exactly this kind of creativity .PERIOD
But then the company passes through this dark stage to this Democrat .PERIOD
Okay ,COMMA for a second example ,COMMA think about this cultural hero ,COMMA icon on the Left ,COMMA creator of this character .PERIOD
Look at the site that he built :COLON Star Wars MashUps ,COMMA inviting people to come and use their creative energy to produce a new generation of attention towards this extraordinarily important cultural icon .PERIOD
So the point is the Republicans here recognize that there's a certain need of ownership ,COMMA a respect for ownership ,COMMA the respect we should give the creator ,COMMA the remixer ,COMMA the owner ,COMMA the property owner ,COMMA the copyright owner of this extraordinarily powerful stuff ,COMMA and not a generation of sharecroppers .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA I think there are lessons we should learn here ,COMMA lessons about openness .PERIOD
Our lives are sharing activities ,COMMA at least in part .PERIOD
That's number one .PERIOD Number two :COLON This ecology of sharing needs freedom within which to create .PERIOD
And number three :COLON We need to respect the creator ,COMMA the creator of these remixes through rights that are directly tied to them .PERIOD
These tools that we built enable this sharing in parts through licenses that make it clear and a freedom to create without requiring permission first because the permission has already been granted and a respect for the creator because it builds upon a copyright the creator has licensed freely .PERIOD
And it explains the vast right-wing conspiracy that's obviously developed around these licenses ,COMMA as now more than 350 million digital objects are out there ,COMMA licensed freely in this way .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA if we can learn those values from at least some influences on the Right ,COMMA if we can take them and incorporate them ,COMMA maybe we could do a little trade .PERIOD
In fact ,COMMA someone on Reddit thought ,COMMA Oh ,COMMA what a great thing ,COMMA we should all vote this up .PERIOD
And that was that the Internet loves Mister Splashy Pants .PERIOD
They even created an e-card so you could send your friend a dancing Splashy .PERIOD
There are so many great publishing tools that are available ,COMMA it only takes a few minutes of your time now to actually produce something .PERIOD
If you want to succeed you've got to be okay to just lose control .PERIOD
Well we all know the World Wide Web has absolutely transformed publishing ,COMMA broadcasting ,COMMA commerce and social connectivity ,COMMA but where did it all come from ?QUESTIONMARK
Vannevar Bush was the US .PERIOD government's chief scientific adviser during the war .PERIOD
And the memex would link information ,COMMA one piece of information to a related piece of information and so forth .PERIOD
He built a system .PERIOD
And we delivered the world's first hypertext system .PERIOD
They had a 12 -page supplement in the Wall Street Journal the day it launched .PERIOD
I thought ,COMMA well ,COMMA you know ,COMMA interesting ,COMMA but a guy from CERN ,COMMA he's not going to do this .PERIOD
In 1992 ,COMMA his paper was rejected for the Hypertext Conference .PERIOD
Secondly ,COMMA for the first time in the modern era ,COMMA the dominant country in the world -- which I think is what China will become -- will be not from the West and from very ,COMMA very different civilizational roots .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA I know it's a widespread assumption in the West that as countries modernize ,COMMA they also westernize .PERIOD
It will remain in very fundamental respects very different .PERIOD
In other words ,COMMA China ,COMMA unlike the Western states and most countries in the world ,COMMA is shaped by its sense of civilization ,COMMA its existence as a civilization-state ,COMMA rather than as a nation-state .PERIOD
Well ,COMMA basically the East was swallowed by the West .PERIOD
Hence their attitude ,COMMA for example ,COMMA to the Uyghurs and to the Tibetans .PERIOD
This is the Chinese view of the state -- very ,COMMA very different to ours .PERIOD
Know that China believes in the market and the state .PERIOD
Moreover ,COMMA this is a very old state tradition ,COMMA a very old tradition of statecraft .PERIOD
And yet we still insist ,COMMA by and large ,COMMA in thinking that we can understand China by simply drawing on Western experience ,COMMA looking at it through Western eyes ,COMMA using Western concepts .PERIOD
But it's not .PERIOD
Whereas those cultures -- virtually the rest of the world ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA which have been in a far weaker position ,COMMA vis-a-vis the West -- have been thereby forced to understand the West ,COMMA because of the West's presence in those societies .PERIOD
Because what's happening ?QUESTIONMARK Back to that chart at the beginning ,COMMA the Goldman Sachs chart .PERIOD
Europe was not at the final negotiating table .PERIOD
Well ,COMMA maybe that's true ,COMMA maybe that's an exaggeration .PERIOD
But there's another problem which goes along with this -- that Europe is increasingly out of touch with the world -- and that is a sort of loss of a sense of the future .PERIOD
Or take this :COLON now this is an idea ,COMMA but it's an idea to be tried out shortly in a suburb of Beijing .PERIOD
Accelerometers on each hand read hand position .PERIOD
And he was very impressed .PERIOD He was all tearing up .PERIOD Ready to hug me .PERIOD
I must have done about 30000 caricatures .PERIOD
That evening ,COMMA I came home to hundreds of hate mails ,COMMA hundreds of people telling me how they could have lived another day without seeing this .PERIOD
I was also asked to leave the organization ,COMMA a cartoonists' organization in America ,COMMA that for me was my lifeline .PERIOD
And ,COMMA all of a sudden ,COMMA my paintings came alive .PERIOD
The collaborative effort was fabulous .PERIOD
Since I mentioned my wife ,COMMA the most important collaboration has been with her ,COMMA Netra .PERIOD
I must have been 19 and a half then ,COMMA and it was love at first sight .PERIOD
I lived in India .PERIOD She lived in America .PERIOD
Notice one thing ,COMMA we're equal here .PERIOD
We had fashion designers ,COMMA installation artists ,COMMA models ,COMMA we had makeup artists ,COMMA jewelry designers ,COMMA all kinds of people working with me to make my wedding an art installation .PERIOD
And I had a special installation in tribute to my in-laws .PERIOD
I could not live this larger than life person .PERIOD
This time I said let's try something different .PERIOD
And this was just eight months ago .PERIOD
I walk into her room ,COMMA and there was a shy girl ,COMMA and she was bald ,COMMA and she was trying to hide her baldness .PERIOD
I whipped out my pen ,COMMA and I started drawing on her head and I drew a crown for her .PERIOD
Our computers ,COMMA our systems will be as primitive as the Apollo's are for today .PERIOD
We can develop any part of the body .PERIOD
The other major development is going to be in the area of what can happen in genetics .PERIOD
This would imply a massive leap in migration .PERIOD
An individual ,COMMA for the first time in the history of humanity ,COMMA will have the capacity ,COMMA by 2030 ,COMMA to destroy the planet ,COMMA to wreck everything ,COMMA through the creation ,COMMA for example ,COMMA of a biopathogen .PERIOD
More people ,COMMA smaller spaces ,COMMA less stuff .PERIOD
For example ,COMMA I want to use Zipcar .PERIOD
And so from a branding perspective ,COMMA they got a lot right .PERIOD
Platforms are invitations .PERIOD
So creating Craigslist or iTunes and the iPhone developer network ,COMMA there are all these networks -- Facebook as well .PERIOD
Essentially ,COMMA there are all sorts of restaurants in Oakland ,COMMA near where I live .PERIOD
And one quick example is Velib ,COMMA in 2007 ,COMMA came forward in Paris with a very bold proposition ,COMMA a very big bike-sharing service .PERIOD
We're at the very beginning of something that ,COMMA what we're seeing and the way that mesh companies are coming forward ,COMMA is inviting ,COMMA it's engaging ,COMMA but it's very early .PERIOD

They were making scary faces to play the caricature of themselves .PERIOD
So we decided to take portraits of Palestinians and Israelis doing the same jobs -- taxi-driver ,COMMA lawyer ,COMMA cooks .PERIOD
The experts said ,COMMA No way .PERIOD
We said ,COMMA Okay ,COMMA let's try and push as far as we can .PERIOD
Okay ,COMMA for example ,COMMA that's Palestine .PERIOD
Three kids -- that was three students -- were [detained] by the army because they were not carrying their papers .PERIOD
We need culture out there .PERIOD
You see that enough in the media .PERIOD
What I want to show is the incredible life .PERIOD

When you look at Kibera now ,COMMA they look back .PERIOD
So we could just walk in the street during the next days and the photos would get revealed by themselves .PERIOD
So we didn't get caught this time .PERIOD
Hopefully ,COMMA you'll see the film ,COMMA and you'll understand the scope of the project and what the people felt when they saw those photos .PERIOD
Because that's a big part of it .PERIOD There's layers behind each photo .PERIOD
But tell me ,COMMA advertising for what ?QUESTIONMARK
The people I photograph were proud to participate in the project and to have their photo in the community .PERIOD
The importance is what you do with the images ,COMMA the statement it makes where it's pasted .PERIOD
This image of three men wearing gas masks was taken in Chernobyl originally ,COMMA and I pasted it in Southern Italy ,COMMA where the mafia sometimes bury the garbage under the ground .PERIOD
So a subject you're passionate about ,COMMA a person who you want to tell their story or even your own photos -- tell me what you stand for .PERIOD
Einstein's especially interested in Penelope's talk .PERIOD
A lot of her research goes on in caves ,COMMA which can get pretty dusty .PERIOD
Well ,COMMA that's really cool ,COMMA but what Einstein's really hoping is that maybe he'll genetically engineer a five-pound peanut .PERIOD
That is one big peanut .PERIOD Since Einstein is a bird ,COMMA she's very interested in things that fly .PERIOD
E :COLON [Spaceship noise] SW :COLON Even if it doesn't have a laser ?QUESTIONMARK
E :COLON [Squawks] SW :COLON Yeah ,COMMA it sure can .PERIOD But when Einstein needs to relax from her job educating the public ,COMMA she loves to take in the arts .PERIOD

And about five years ago ,COMMA we asked what was the most important need for innovation in schooling here in the UK .PERIOD
The minister of education down south in London described himself as a big fan .PERIOD
They're not like all of you who can sit in rows and hear things said to you for hour after hour .PERIOD
I would run into the living room ,COMMA jump up on the couch ,COMMA rip the cushions off ,COMMA throw them on the floor ,COMMA scream at the top of my lungs and run out because I was the Incredible Hulk .PERIOD
And I would like to share my art .PERIOD
So ,COMMA moving onward .PERIOD
First principles ,COMMA this is very important .PERIOD
I tried kickboards .PERIOD
Hand paddles ,COMMA everything .PERIOD
Kicking harder doesn't solve the problem because the average swimmer only transfers about three percent of their energy expenditure into forward motion .PERIOD
So let's look at some examples .PERIOD This is Terry .PERIOD
Rather ,COMMA he is entering the water at a 45 -degree angle with his forearm ,COMMA and then propelling himself by streamlining -- very important .PERIOD
Below is what most swimmers will find enables them to do what I did ,COMMA which is going from 21 strokes per 20 -yard length to 11 strokes in two workouts with no coach ,COMMA no video monitoring .PERIOD
In freestyle ,COMMA easiest way to remedy this is to turn with body roll ,COMMA and just to look at your recovery hand as it enters the water .PERIOD
Then I transferred to a different school sophomore year ,COMMA and I had a choice of other languages .PERIOD Most of my friends were taking Japanese .PERIOD
I couldn't believe I was on the other side of the world .PERIOD
And a teacher came up to me and handed me a piece of paper .PERIOD
And that's pretty much my response .PERIOD
Nothing worked until I found this .PERIOD
Many of the publications in Japan limit themselves to these characters ,COMMA to facilitate literacy -- some are required to .PERIOD
And now I love languages .PERIOD
I was so concerned with her perception of what I was doing ,COMMA that it exploded in my face ,COMMA never to return to the ballroom dancing club .PERIOD
Everyone burst into laughter .PERIOD I was humiliated .PERIOD
So I had a very short deadline for a competition .PERIOD
These seemed to be the three areas that I could exploit to compete if I wanted to comptete against people who'd been practicing for 20 to 30 years .PERIOD
That photo is of the semi-finals of the Buenos Aires championships ,COMMA four months later .PERIOD
Then one month later ,COMMA went to the world championships ,COMMA made it to the semi-final .PERIOD And then set a world record ,COMMA following that ,COMMA two weeks later .PERIOD
So he can lift the woman to break her ,COMMA for example .PERIOD
There are many different types .PERIOD
I have hundreds of hours of footage -- all categorized ,COMMA much like George Carlin categorized his comedy .PERIOD
So fear is your friend .PERIOD Fear is an indicator .PERIOD
Especially with fears you gained when you were a child .PERIOD
And if any of you are interested in that ,COMMA I would love to speak with you .PERIOD
But I ask a lot of questions ,COMMA and I would love your advice .PERIOD
It's written using Wiki software -- which is the type of software he just demonstrated -- so anyone can quickly edit and save ,COMMA and it goes live on the Internet immediately .PERIOD
So when Yochai is talking about new methods of organization ,COMMA he's exactly describing Wikipedia .PERIOD And what I'm going to do today is tell you a little bit more about how it really works on the inside .PERIOD
And so if you think about what that means ,COMMA it means a lot more than just building a cool website .PERIOD
And so that's a big part of why we've chosen the free licensing model ,COMMA because that empowers local entrepreneurs -- or anyone who wants to ,COMMA can take our content and do anything they like with it -- you can copy it ,COMMA redistribute it and you can do it commercially or non-commercially .PERIOD
The biggest languages are German ,COMMA Japanese ,COMMA French -- all the Western European languages are quite big .PERIOD
So the big question when you've got this really chaotic organization is ,COMMA why isn't it all rubbish ?QUESTIONMARK Why is the website as good as it is ?QUESTIONMARK
The actual truth about the specific Bush-Kerry incident is that the Bush-Kerry articles were locked less than one percent of the time in 2004 ,COMMA and it wasn't because they were contentious ;SEMICOLON it was just because there was routine vandalism -- which happens sometimes even on stage ,COMMA people -- sometimes even reporters have reported to me that they vandalize Wikipedia and were amazed that it was fixed so quickly .PERIOD
So the biggest and the most important thing is our neutral point-of-view policy .PERIOD
If you engage in that type of behavior ,COMMA you'll be asked to leave the community .PERIOD
And then users can set up their own personal watch list .PERIOD
So my page is on quite a few volunteers' watch lists ,COMMA because it is sometimes vandalized .PERIOD
And that's a really important thing to understand ,COMMA is that the vast majority of the edits that go on on the website are from a very close-knit community of maybe 600 to 1000 people who are in constant communication .PERIOD
Another thing that we do within the community is we leave everything very open-ended .PERIOD
I give this talk sometimes with Angela ,COMMA who was just re-elected to the Board from the community -- to the Board of the Foundation ,COMMA with more than twice the votes of the person who didn't make it .PERIOD
Of course ,COMMA the vote ended up being about 85 to 18 ,COMMA so there was no real danger to our democratic processes .PERIOD
It strikes me that much of the textbooks that are used to educate our children are inherently biased .PERIOD
Have you found Wikipedia being used by teachers ,COMMA and how do you see Wikipedia changing education ?QUESTIONMARK
It builds on the storyline of bloggers versus newspapers .PERIOD
I sent it from my Harvard email address ,COMMA because I was recently appointed a fellow there .PERIOD
And so the Wiki books project is an effort to do that .PERIOD
In the jungles of Guatemala ,COMMA in Tikal ,COMMA stands a temple .PERIOD
His name was Jasaw Chan K'awiil .PERIOD
He lived into his 80 s ,COMMA and he was buried beneath this monument in 720 AD .PERIOD
They've never found a society that did not have it .PERIOD
It was told by an anonymous Kwakiutl Indian of southern Alaska to a missionary in 1896 ,COMMA and here it is .PERIOD
It's below your emotions .PERIOD
It comes from a David Mamet play ,COMMA and there's two con artists in the play ,COMMA and the woman is conning the man ,COMMA and the man looks at the woman and says ,COMMA Oh ,COMMA you're a bad pony ,COMMA I'm not going to bet on you .PERIOD
So ,COMMA what have I learned from this experiment that I would like to tell the world ?QUESTIONMARK
Too old ,COMMA too young ,COMMA too scruffy ,COMMA too stupid ,COMMA and they won't do it .PERIOD
And in fact ,COMMA sometimes I feel a little sorry for the chicken on my dinner plate ,COMMA when I think of how intense this brain system is .PERIOD
And so ,COMMA I've spent the last three years on this .PERIOD
And so ,COMMA there's one thing that makes me pursue my understanding of human nature ,COMMA and this reminds me of it .PERIOD
Women tend to get intimacy differently than men do .PERIOD

For example ,COMMA last winter I began with kite surfing -- so new things .PERIOD
Because this is -- I'm quite an experienced manager of systems as a pilot ,COMMA but this is really -- you need fluidity ,COMMA you need to be agile and also to adapt really fast .PERIOD
So I was at my minimum altitude in that vector -- fast -- so I pulled that .PERIOD
Exactly .PERIOD There is a rescue parachute for the wing for two reasons :COLON so I can repair it afterward and especially so nobody takes that ,COMMA just on his head .PERIOD

Discoveries like fire happened so rarely ,COMMA that from an individual's point of view ,COMMA the world never improved .PERIOD
Within 40 years ,COMMA physicists discovered the whole explanation ,COMMA expressed ,COMMA as usual ,COMMA in elegant symbols .PERIOD
But that ability to make progress remained almost unused ,COMMA until the event that revolutionized the human condition and changed the universe .PERIOD
But that can't be what made the difference .PERIOD
And that rarely ,COMMA if ever ,COMMA caused anything like the Scientific Revolution .PERIOD
At the time ,COMMA what they thought distinguished science was a radical idea about things unseen ,COMMA known as empiricism .PERIOD
In what language ?QUESTIONMARK Certainly not the language of mathematics ,COMMA in which ,COMMA Galileo rightly said ,COMMA the book of nature is written .PERIOD
By the way ,COMMA why don't we do that ?QUESTIONMARK
We don't see those nuclear reactions in stars .PERIOD
Some rocks and some finches .PERIOD
What we see ,COMMA in all these cases ,COMMA bears no resemblance to the reality that we conclude is responsible -- only a long chain of theoretical reasoning and interpretation connects them .PERIOD
That myth is testable .PERIOD

They're going to get to land .PERIOD
But unfortunately ,COMMA 95 percent of the glaciers in the Arctic are also receding right now to the point that the ice is ending up on land and not injecting any ice back into the ecosystem .PERIOD
These ringed seals also live out their entire life cycle associated and connected to sea ice .PERIOD
Here's me in my office .PERIOD
After an hour in these conditions ,COMMA it's so extreme that ,COMMA when I go down ,COMMA almost every dive I vomit into my regulator because my body can't deal with the stress of the cold on my head .PERIOD

As a species ,COMMA as humans ,COMMA we like to say penguins are really cute ,COMMA therefore ,COMMA leopard seals eat them ,COMMA so leopard seals are ugly and bad .PERIOD
It just sees this big balloon in the ocean -- it doesn't have hands -- it's going to take a little bite ,COMMA the boat pops ,COMMA and off they go .PERIOD
I'm with my Swedish assistant and guide .PERIOD
It's time for you to get in the water .PERIOD
Why else would she release these penguins at me ?QUESTIONMARK
Because she can't believe I can't eat this penguin .PERIOD
She's about to let me know she's too frustrated with me .PERIOD

They go to see Michelangelo's David ,COMMA and when they finally come face to face with the statue ,COMMA they both freeze dead in their tracks .PERIOD
If you know about this trait ,COMMA you can understand a lot of puzzles about human behavior .PERIOD
When the liberal team loses ,COMMA as it did in 2004 ,COMMA and as it almost did in 2000 ,COMMA we comfort ourselves .PERIOD
Developmental psychology has shown that kids come into the world already knowing so much about the physical and social worlds ,COMMA and programmed to make it really easy for them to learn certain things and hard to learn others .PERIOD
Here are the results .PERIOD
So ,COMMA as you see ,COMMA people care about harm and care issues .PERIOD
You picked a particular breed ,COMMA you learned some new information about the breed .PERIOD
In the first panel ,COMMA we see the moment of creation .PERIOD
It shoots up and it keeps going up .PERIOD
I think that's probably right ,COMMA although this is a controversial issue .PERIOD
It's just a lot of rock ,COMMA and then a lot of water and wind ,COMMA and a lot of time ,COMMA and you get the Grand Canyon .PERIOD
So liberals speak for the weak and oppressed .PERIOD
You have the markings of Shiva on the right ,COMMA Shiva's the liberal god .PERIOD And they work together .PERIOD
But as we learned from Samantha Power ,COMMA in her story about Sergio Vieira de Mello ,COMMA you can't just go charging in ,COMMA saying ,COMMA You're wrong ,COMMA and I'm right .PERIOD
If Australia had to send a thousand people tomorrow to West Papua for example ,COMMA we don't have a thousand police officers hanging around that could just go tomorrow and we do have a thousand soldiers that could go .PERIOD
So when we have to send someone ,COMMA we send the military -- because they're there ,COMMA they're available and ,COMMA heck ,COMMA they're used to going off and doing these things and living by themselves and not having all this extra support .PERIOD
One particular thing that's come up that I am especially interested in is the question of whether ,COMMA when we're sending military personnel to do these sorts of jobs ,COMMA we ought to be equipping them differently ,COMMA and in particular ,COMMA whether we ought to be giving them access to some of the sorts of non-lethal weapons that police have .PERIOD
Military personnel are being trained for war ,COMMA so they're trained that ,COMMA as soon as things go bad ,COMMA their first response is lethal force .PERIOD
And of course ,COMMA being Australian ,COMMA I started looking at stuff in Australia ,COMMA knowing ,COMMA again ,COMMA from my own experience about various times when non-lethal weapons have been introduced in Australia .PERIOD
This is something they can use instead of a firearm in those situations where they would have previously had to shoot someone .PERIOD
This was something explicitly introduced to be an alternative to firearms ,COMMA but it's being routinely used to deal with a whole range of other sorts of problems .PERIOD
Now one of the particular issues that comes up with military use of non-lethal weapons -- and people when they're actually saying ,COMMA Well hey ,COMMA there might be some problems -- there's a couple of particular problems that get focused on .PERIOD
You have to be careful about who you're shooting at .PERIOD
They were holding something like 700 people hostage .PERIOD
And it's no surprise that people died ,COMMA because you don't know how much of this gas each person is going to inhale ,COMMA what position they're going to fall in when they become unconscious and so on .PERIOD
The person who's spraying the OC .PERIOD spray is wearing a rubber glove to make sure they don't get contaminated and so on .PERIOD
Just in case you think it's only going to happen in the United States ,COMMA it happened in Canada as well .PERIOD
And a colleague of mine sent me this one from London .PERIOD
I looked at it .PERIOD I was really surprised .PERIOD
So if you have these problems with police officers with non-lethal weapons ,COMMA what on earth would make you think it's going to be better with military personnel ?QUESTIONMARK
What would these guys have done if they'd had access to Tasers or to a manned ,COMMA portable version of the Active Denial System -- a small heat ray that you can use on people and not worry about it .PERIOD
And here he'll explain a little bit about what it does .PERIOD
And I found this old video .PERIOD
With our strengths and our minds and spirit ,COMMA we gather ,COMMA we form ,COMMA and we fashion .PERIOD
This particular reel -- it's an industrial video -- but it was shown in drive-in theaters in 1961 -- in the Detroit area ,COMMA in fact -- and it preceded Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho .PERIOD
And when I sat down next to him ,COMMA he was telling me about a company he formed ,COMMA and he was building some robots for automobile factories to move things around on the factory floor .PERIOD
Now the other thing that I think is taking off ,COMMA another reason making is taking off today ,COMMA is there's some great new tools out there .PERIOD
So they're the brains of maker projects ,COMMA and here's an example of one .PERIOD
These guys came up with a kit version for 750 dollars ,COMMA and that means that hobbyists and ordinary folks can get a hold of this and begin playing with 3 D printers .PERIOD
Isn't that cool ?QUESTIONMARK
Well he did a little bit better than free .PERIOD
So ,COMMA we all think we know what glamour is .PERIOD Here it is .PERIOD
It's glamorous movie stars ,COMMA like Marlene Dietrich .PERIOD
Fantastic ,COMMA glamorous pictures of steel mills and paper mills and all kinds of glamorous industrial places .PERIOD
You had a glamour .PERIOD
There is a process of idealization ,COMMA glorification and dramatization ,COMMA and it's not just the case for people .PERIOD
Glamour doesn't have to be people .PERIOD
It puts you into this special ,COMMA special world .PERIOD
She's not looking away from you exactly ,COMMA but you have to mentally imagine her world .PERIOD
She's encouraging you to contemplate this higher world to which she belongs ,COMMA where she can be completely tranquil while holding the iron instruments of her death by torture .PERIOD
This sort of streamlining styling is not just glamorous because we associate it with movies of that period ,COMMA but because ,COMMA in it's streamlining ,COMMA it transports us from the everyday .PERIOD
To conceal all art and make whatever is done or said appear to be without effort :COLON And this is one of the critical aspects of glamour .PERIOD
But if you look in a catalog -- particularly a catalog of modern ,COMMA beautiful objects for your home -- it looks like this .PERIOD
Part of the thing is that ,COMMA in Rear Window ,COMMA the question is ,COMMA is she too glamorous to live in his world ?QUESTIONMARK
And the answer is no ,COMMA but of course it's really just a movie .PERIOD
So ,COMMA this session's supposed to be about pure pleasure but glamour's really partly about meaning .PERIOD
The perfect love life -- symbolized by the perfect necklace ,COMMA the perfect diamond ring .PERIOD
This is an interior design firm that is literally called Utopia .PERIOD
But there's a kind of wonder in the stuff that gets edited away in the cords of life .PERIOD
David Hockney talks about how the appreciation of this very glamorous painting is heightened if you think about the fact that it takes two weeks to paint this splash ,COMMA which only took a fraction of a second to happen .PERIOD
But I also knew how hard they worked all week .PERIOD
But as a scientist ,COMMA I'm interested in a different problem of other minds ,COMMA and that is the one I'm going to introduce to you today .PERIOD
And then finally ,COMMA to show that some of the differences between people ,COMMA in how we judge others ,COMMA can be explained by differences in this brain system .PERIOD
Child :COLON What ?QUESTIONMARK RS :COLON Pirates really like cheese sandwiches .PERIOD
This pirate is called Joshua .PERIOD
Now I'm going to show you a three-year-old who got the same puzzle .PERIOD
So the three-year-old does two things differently .PERIOD
And second ,COMMA when he sees Ivan taking the sandwich where he left his ,COMMA where we would say he's taking that one because he thinks it's his ,COMMA the three-year-old comes up with another explanation :COLON He's not taking his own sandwich because he doesn't want it ,COMMA because now it's dirty ,COMMA on the ground .PERIOD
So that's why he's taking the other sandwich .PERIOD
And we can see the continuation of this process of learning to think about other people's thoughts by upping the ante and asking children now ,COMMA not for an action prediction ,COMMA but for a moral judgment .PERIOD
Remember the five-year-old completely understood why Ivan took Joshua's sandwich .PERIOD
Was Ivan being mean and naughty for taking Joshua's sandwich ?QUESTIONMARK
He says the wind should get in trouble for switching the sandwiches .PERIOD
And so what we wanted to know was ,COMMA could differences among adults in how they think about other people's thoughts be explained in terms of differences in this brain region ?QUESTIONMARK
And her friend drinks the coffee ,COMMA and is fine .PERIOD
And what you can see is ,COMMA on the left when there was very little activity in this brain region ,COMMA people paid little attention to her innocent belief and said she deserved a lot of blame for the accident .PERIOD
First ,COMMA I'm going to show you that this is a magnetic pulse .PERIOD
I'm going to show you what happens when you put a quarter on the machine .PERIOD
But in the case of a failed attempt to harm ,COMMA where Grace thought that it was poison ,COMMA although it was really sugar ,COMMA people now say it was more okay ,COMMA she deserves less blame for putting the powder in the coffee .PERIOD
So it's not a surreptitious technology .PERIOD
So I've got one last question .PERIOD There is this thing called the hard problem of consciousness ,COMMA that puzzles a lot of people .PERIOD
Why ?QUESTIONMARK
Me was composed of stories ,COMMA of cravings ,COMMA of strivings ,COMMA of desires of the future .PERIOD
Me only existed in the trying .PERIOD

It was my whole self melting into Michaela's lap .PERIOD
It was finding my place and the huge responsibility that comes with connection .PERIOD
It was energy ,COMMA love and joy .PERIOD

Because everyone these days wants to know how to slow down ,COMMA but they want to know how to slow down really quickly .PERIOD So .PERIOD
So I was in New York recently ,COMMA and I walked past a gym that had an advertisement in the window for a new course ,COMMA a new evening course .PERIOD
You know ,COMMA a burnout ,COMMA or eventually the body says ,COMMA I can't take it anymore ,COMMA and throws in the towel .PERIOD
Am I really in such a hurry that I'm prepared to fob off my son with a sound byte at the end of the day ?QUESTIONMARK
I just thought ,COMMA and I thought long and hard .PERIOD
And by the time I got off that plane ,COMMA I'd decided I wanted to do something about it .PERIOD
Time is scarce ,COMMA so what do we do ?QUESTIONMARK
And I guess that the question is ,COMMA is it possible to break free from that mindset ?QUESTIONMARK
And ,COMMA in this kind of cauldron of moments and places and acts of deceleration ,COMMA lie what a lot of people now refer to as the International Slow Movement .PERIOD
You know ,COMMA you tap into that -- those deeper ,COMMA sort of ,COMMA psychological ,COMMA emotional ,COMMA spiritual currents ,COMMA and you get a better orgasm with the buildup .PERIOD
I mean ,COMMA you heard that I got a speeding ticket while I was researching my book on the benefits of slowness ,COMMA and that's true ,COMMA but that's not all of it .PERIOD
I think there's a kind of metaphysical dimension -- that speed becomes a way of walling ourselves off from the bigger ,COMMA deeper questions .PERIOD
We fill our head with distraction ,COMMA with busyness ,COMMA so that we don't have to ask ,COMMA am I well ?QUESTIONMARK Am I happy ?QUESTIONMARK Are my children growing up right ?QUESTIONMARK
It's become my reward at the end of the day ,COMMA something I really cherish .PERIOD
I was downstairs by the front door ,COMMA and I was waiting for a taxi ,COMMA and my son came down the stairs and he'd made a card for me .PERIOD And he was carrying it .PERIOD

And here studying ,COMMA in three dimensions ,COMMA how to give some kind ,COMMA again ,COMMA of order ,COMMA a structure ;SEMICOLON not something you feel you could just change because you stop the design of that particular process .PERIOD
I'd like to conclude by relating all of what I've said to the term beauty .PERIOD
We call a natural object beautiful because we see that its form expresses fitness ,COMMA the perfect fulfillment of function .PERIOD
Nevertheless ,COMMA beauty as the kind of fit ;SEMICOLON something that tells us that all the forces that have to do with our natural environment have been fulfilled -- and our human environment -- for that .PERIOD
He who seeks truth shall find beauty .PERIOD He who seeks beauty shall find vanity .PERIOD
He who considers himself the servant of his fellow beings shall find the joy of self-expression .PERIOD He who seeks self-expression shall fall into the pit of arrogance .PERIOD

And we're starting in June .PERIOD So this is the monsoon rain .PERIOD
Nothing for these dragonflies .PERIOD There is no more seasonal rain .PERIOD
They're looking for somewhere to breed .PERIOD If it rains here they'll breed .PERIOD
They'll hatch out in six weeks .PERIOD By that time the seasonal rains have moved on .PERIOD It's not there ,COMMA it's down here .PERIOD
They'll fly down here .PERIOD And the clever thing is the wind is always converging to where the rain is .PERIOD
So ,COMMA the little fellow that hatches out here ,COMMA he gets up into the air ,COMMA he is automatically carried to where the rain is falling .PERIOD
So ,COMMA in four generations ,COMMA one ,COMMA two ,COMMA three ,COMMA four and then back .PERIOD
A complete circuit of the Indian Ocean .PERIOD
There is more to the story .PERIOD
Which is an area along the Amur River ,COMMA which is up here .PERIOD
He's an engineer .PERIOD
Half as much money was spent on this Norden bombsight as was spent on the most famous military-industrial project of the modern era .PERIOD
It allowed you to bomb only those things that you absolutely needed and wanted to bomb .PERIOD
And it's carried in a box with a canvas shroud over it .PERIOD
It's never allowed to be photographed .PERIOD
There are clouds ,COMMA right .PERIOD
The Leuna chemical plant ,COMMA after one of the most extensive bombings in the history of the war ,COMMA was up and running within weeks .PERIOD
So I would like to invite you ,COMMA also ,COMMA for a while ,COMMA to the Himalayas themselves .PERIOD
And to show the place where meditators ,COMMA like me ,COMMA who began with being a molecular biologist in Pasteur Institute ,COMMA and found their way to the mountains .PERIOD
I just wrote an essay on happiness ,COMMA and there was a controversy .PERIOD
As Pascal said ,COMMA even the one who hangs himself ,COMMA somehow ,COMMA is looking for cessation of suffering -- he finds no other way .PERIOD
Although we want to avoid suffering ,COMMA it seems we are running somewhat towards it .PERIOD
And that can also come from some kind of confusions .PERIOD
It is something that -- changes of nature .PERIOD
It is a deep sense of serenity and fulfillment ,COMMA a state that actually pervades and underlies all emotional states ,COMMA and all the joys and sorrows that can come one's way .PERIOD
Can we have this kind of well-being while being sad ?QUESTIONMARK In a way ,COMMA why not ?QUESTIONMARK
But there's also wicked joy ,COMMA you can rejoice in someone's suffering .PERIOD
We know ,COMMA by experience ,COMMA that we can be what we call a little paradise ,COMMA and yet ,COMMA be completely unhappy within .PERIOD
The experience that translates everything is within the mind .PERIOD
We have to know from ourselves ,COMMA there are certain states of mind that are conducive to this flourishing ,COMMA to this well-being ,COMMA what the Greeks called eudaimonia ,COMMA flourishing .PERIOD
Just the mere fact of doing that fills such a sense of adequation with our deep nature .PERIOD
For that we have to ask ,COMMA what is nature of mind ?QUESTIONMARK
And if we look from the experiential point of view ,COMMA there is a primary quality of consciousness that's just the mere fact to be cognitive ,COMMA to be aware .PERIOD
Usually ,COMMA when we feel annoyed ,COMMA hatred or upset with someone ,COMMA or obsessed with something ,COMMA the mind goes again and again to that object .PERIOD
But we think we could sit on the cloud -- but if you go there ,COMMA it's just mist .PERIOD
Mind transformation -- that is the very meaning of meditation .PERIOD
So that's what those great meditators have been doing .PERIOD
If you are happy about something ,COMMA you'll go more to the left side .PERIOD
Here ,COMMA the - 05 is the full standard deviation of a meditator who meditated on compassion .PERIOD
So ,COMMA I've no time to go into all the different scientific results .PERIOD
Some meditators ,COMMA without trying to stop it ,COMMA but simply by being completely open ,COMMA thinking that that bang is just going to be just a small event like a shooting star ,COMMA they are able not to move at all .PERIOD
So the whole point of that is not ,COMMA sort of ,COMMA to make ,COMMA like ,COMMA a circus thing of showing exceptional beings who can jump ,COMMA or whatever .PERIOD
We are ready to spend 15 years achieving education .PERIOD
I'm not going to show you a presentation .PERIOD I'm going to talk to you .PERIOD
The thing that was always striking to me was that we as people could have so many really amazing ideas about things we'd like to do ,COMMA but are so often unable ,COMMA in the real world ,COMMA to actually do those things -- to actually cobble together the materials and go through the actual execution phase of building something that you imagine from a design perspective .PERIOD
It's going to be different than here .PERIOD
To give you an idea of scale ,COMMA Second Life is about 20000 CPUs at this point .PERIOD
And let me justify that with two statements .PERIOD
And I think that's something that people have talked about for 20 years -- you know ,COMMA that 3 D ,COMMA that lifelike environments are really important in some magical way to us .PERIOD
Second Life originally had 16 simulators .PERIOD It now has 20000 .PERIOD
And we had -- we zoned it ,COMMA you know :COLON we put a nightclub ,COMMA we put a disco where you could dance ,COMMA and then we had a place where you could fight with guns if you wanted to ,COMMA and we had another place that was like a boardwalk ,COMMA kind of a Coney Island .PERIOD
And so the existence of an economy is critical .PERIOD
The question is ,COMMA there appears to be a lack of cultural fine-tuning in Second Life .PERIOD
And so ,COMMA the multicultural nature and the sort of cultural melting pot that's happening inside Second Life is quite -- I think ,COMMA quite remarkable relative to what in real human terms in the real world we've ever been able to achieve .PERIOD
Other questions ?QUESTIONMARK Right here .PERIOD
What's your demographic ?QUESTIONMARK
In terms of psychographic -- oh ,COMMA men and women :COLON men and women are almost equally matched in Second Life ,COMMA so about 45 percent of the people online right now on Second Life are women .PERIOD
In terms of psychographic ,COMMA you know ,COMMA the people in Second Life are remarkably dissimilar relative to what you might think ,COMMA when you go in and talk to them and meet them ,COMMA and I would ,COMMA you know ,COMMA challenge you to just do this and find out .PERIOD
If you count ,COMMA yeah ,COMMA cities .PERIOD So -- but I did -- and I didn't do -- I think I didn't do as well in school as I could have .PERIOD I think you're right .PERIOD
Yeah ,COMMA so let me restate that .PERIOD
So ,COMMA you're saying that in the pamphlet there's a statement that we may come to prefer our digital selves to our real ones -- our more malleable or manageable digital identities to our real identities -- and that in fact ,COMMA much of human life and human experience may move into the digital realm .PERIOD
That's a frightening change ,COMMA frightening disruption .PERIOD
I guess ,COMMA and you're asking ,COMMA what do I think about that ?QUESTIONMARK How do I -- JH :COLON What's your response to the people who would say ,COMMA that's horrifying ?QUESTIONMARK
(Audience :COLON If someone would say to you ,COMMA I find that disturbing ,COMMA what would be your response) PR :COLON Well ,COMMA I'd say a couple of things .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA the problem of human diversity ,COMMA like all big scientific questions -- how do you explain something like that -- can be broken down into sub-questions .PERIOD
What we're asking about though is human ancestry .PERIOD
Digging things up out of the ground ,COMMA and largely on the basis of morphology -- the way things are shaped ,COMMA often skull shape -- saying ,COMMA This looks a little bit more like us than that ,COMMA so this must be my ancestor .PERIOD
You think you've got a tough job ?QUESTIONMARK
Now ,COMMA a quick primer on DNA .PERIOD
Mitochondrial DNA ,COMMA tracing a purely maternal line of descent .PERIOD
Turn them on their sides ,COMMA combine them so that they look like a tree with the root at the bottom and the branches going up .PERIOD
Was it millions of years ago ,COMMA which we might suspect by looking at all this incredible variation around the world ?QUESTIONMARK
Why was it that we seem to have come out of Africa so recently ?QUESTIONMARK
What was going on to the world's weather around 60000 years ago ?QUESTIONMARK
The reason for that is that ice actually sucks moisture out of the atmosphere .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA at the risk of offending any paleoanthropologists or physical anthropologists in the audience ,COMMA basically there's not a lot of change between these two stone tool groups .PERIOD
Well ,COMMA you want the ultimate African success story ?QUESTIONMARK
Look in the mirror .PERIOD You're it .PERIOD The reason you're alive today is because of those changes in our brains that took place in Africa -- probably somewhere in the region where we're sitting right now ,COMMA around 60 ,COMMA 70 thousand years ago -- allowing us not only to survive in Africa ,COMMA but to expand out of Africa .PERIOD
These would have been savannah hunters .PERIOD
Entering Europe around 35000 years ago ,COMMA and finally ,COMMA a small group migrating up through the worst weather imaginable ,COMMA Siberia ,COMMA inside the Arctic Circle ,COMMA during the last ice age -- temperature was at - 70 ,COMMA - 80 ,COMMA even - 100 ,COMMA perhaps -- migrating into the Americas ,COMMA ultimately reaching that final frontier .PERIOD
The changes that allowed us to do that ,COMMA the evolution of this highly adaptable brain that we all carry around with us ,COMMA allowing us to create novel cultures ,COMMA allowing us to develop the diversity that we see on a whirlwind trip like the one I've just been on .PERIOD
The field research that we're doing around the world with indigenous peoples .PERIOD
The Human Genome Project ,COMMA or a Mars Rover mission .PERIOD
In this case ,COMMA you actually can .PERIOD
And you'll now see the yolk and the white have separated .PERIOD
And we all know in our heart of hearts that this is not the way the universe works .PERIOD
And yet ,COMMA look around us .PERIOD
Now we move forward 380000 years .PERIOD
But that's not completely true .PERIOD
Recent studies by satellites such as the WMAP satellite have shown that ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA there are just tiny differences in that background .PERIOD
We have our first stars .PERIOD
So we've crossed a fourth threshold of complexity .PERIOD
So ,COMMA it copies itself and scatters the templates through the ocean .PERIOD
And that's why ,COMMA as a species ,COMMA we're so creative and so powerful ,COMMA and that's why we have a history .PERIOD
And then from about 500 years ago ,COMMA humans began to link up globally through shipping ,COMMA through trains ,COMMA through telegraph ,COMMA through the Internet ,COMMA until now we seem to form a single global brain of almost seven billion individuals .PERIOD
We've been on a journey ,COMMA a return journey ,COMMA of 137 billion years .PERIOD
And it's a story in which humans play an astonishing and creative role .PERIOD
Collective learning is a very ,COMMA very powerful force ,COMMA and it's not clear that we humans are in charge of it .PERIOD
The program ,COMMA in a sense ,COMMA is an example of behavioral finance on steroids -- how we could really use behavioral finance .PERIOD
How many of you have iPhones ?QUESTIONMARK
And that's what I really want to focus on today .PERIOD
And what I'm going to talk about today is Save More Tomorrow .PERIOD
First thing to notice is ,COMMA half of them do not even have access to a 401 plan .PERIOD
And they get overwhelmed and the just don't join .PERIOD
Suppose we had another wonderful TED event next week .PERIOD
The same people that imagined themselves eating the bananas ended up eating chocolates a week later .PERIOD
Self-control is not a problem in the future .PERIOD
Nobody checks boxes .PERIOD
We're going to talk about what happens if people are overwhelmed and scared to make their 401 choices .PERIOD
They're really mad .PERIOD
We first implemented it ,COMMA Richard Thaler and I ,COMMA back in 1998 .PERIOD
We invited them to save three percentage points more every time they get a pay raise .PERIOD
We're seeing here a three and a half-year period ,COMMA four pay raises ,COMMA people who were struggling to save ,COMMA were saving three percent of their paycheck ,COMMA three and a half years later saving almost four times as much ,COMMA almost 14 percent .PERIOD
It's been part of the Pension Protection Act .PERIOD

This song is called Fingertips .PERIOD
This is Eleanor Roosevelt .PERIOD
Well ,COMMA I think we're going to stop that part of the show .PERIOD
Here's a song we like to think of as the future anthem of TED .PERIOD
And the third said ,COMMA Let's find another director .PERIOD
So how many people who saw the film did not get that here was a woman in love ,COMMA that she was completely innocent and saw great joy in her life ,COMMA and she was youthful ?QUESTIONMARK
And how many of you did not get that ?QUESTIONMARK
It's a symbolic gesture .PERIOD I tear up the script ,COMMA I go and I panic myself ,COMMA I get scared .PERIOD
Get rid of your mind .PERIOD
In Delhi ,COMMA we used to live -- we used to call it a chhat or the khota .PERIOD
And I don't know why ,COMMA but I remember the story .PERIOD
There was a woodcutter who's about to take his ax and chop a piece of wood ,COMMA and the whole galaxy is one atom of that ax .PERIOD
And when that ax hits that piece of wood ,COMMA that's when everything will destroy and the Big Bang will happen again .PERIOD
But all before that there was a woodcutter .PERIOD
So every time ,COMMA I could tell my story again and again and get over this problem ,COMMA and so I got over the problem .PERIOD
If we do not create the stories ,COMMA we probably go mad .PERIOD
Are you with child ?QUESTIONMARK
You ask my permission before you rut ,COMMA before you breed .PERIOD
Elizabeth :COLON This man has seduced a ward of the queen ,COMMA and she has married without royal consent .PERIOD
Remember the word I said ,COMMA suck up .PERIOD
But I can go on about telling you how we evolve stories ,COMMA and how stories effectively are who we are and how these get translated into the particular discipline that I am in ,COMMA which is film .PERIOD
We're born for them .PERIOD
The children's television host Mr .PERIOD Rogers always carried in his wallet a quote from a social worker that said ,COMMA Frankly ,COMMA there isn't anyone you couldn't learn to love once you've heard their story .PERIOD
And the way I like to interpret that is probably the greatest story commandment ,COMMA which is Make me care -- please ,COMMA emotionally ,COMMA intellectually ,COMMA aesthetically ,COMMA just make me care .PERIOD
And so if I were going to give you the ending of this story ,COMMA it would go something like this :COLON And that's what ultimately led me to speaking to you here at TED about story .PERIOD
He insisted ,COMMA no embalming ,COMMA no open coffin ,COMMA no funeral .PERIOD
It didn't happen to me ,COMMA it happened to somebody else ,COMMA but it's going to be worth your time .PERIOD
♫ And that is all ♫ ♫ that love's about ♫ ♫ And we'll recall ♫ ♫ when time runs out ♫ ♫ That it only ♫ AS :COLON Storytelling without dialogue .PERIOD
It confirmed something I really had a hunch on ,COMMA is that the audience actually wants to work for their meal .PERIOD
And it's something that always drove all his choices .PERIOD
Wall-E's was to find the beauty .PERIOD
Sometimes you can make some horrible choices with them .PERIOD
But a major threshold is passed when you mature enough to acknowledge what drives you and to take the wheel and steer it .PERIOD
And that's why change is fundamental in story .PERIOD
And it's interesting to see how that led us places that were actually pretty good .PERIOD
And we got a hold of that fax .PERIOD
And when an artist does that to another artist ,COMMA it's like you're compelled to pass it on .PERIOD
I was going to help alleviate poverty .PERIOD
We paid two to three times more than anybody else .PERIOD
We may have some innovative ,COMMA new ideas .PERIOD
There's no more of it .PERIOD
This is where we stand today .PERIOD
And then we need to use less again .PERIOD
Okay ,COMMA so let's be generous .PERIOD
How do you evaluate all the scientific data around a product ,COMMA the data that's changing on a weekly ,COMMA if not a daily ,COMMA basis ?QUESTIONMARK
How is a consumer going to walk through this minefield ?QUESTIONMARK
These are the 15 commodities that fundamentally pose the biggest threats to these places because of deforestation ,COMMA soil loss ,COMMA water use ,COMMA pesticide use ,COMMA over-fishing ,COMMA etc .PERIOD
Are we going to work with 15 billion producers ?QUESTIONMARK
If we work with those ,COMMA if we change those companies and the way they do business ,COMMA then the rest will happen automatically .PERIOD
Because if these companies demand sustainable products ,COMMA they'll pull 40 to 50 percent of production .PERIOD
By companies asking for this ,COMMA we can leverage production so much faster than by waiting for consumers to do it .PERIOD
After 40 years ,COMMA the global organic movement has achieved 07 of one percent of global food .PERIOD
We can't wait that long .PERIOD
We need change that's going to accelerate .PERIOD
So it's the demand that brings them to the table .PERIOD
So we're pulling out all the stops .PERIOD
They're doing it with IBM and the USDA ,COMMA and they're putting it in the public domain because they want everybody to have access to this data ,COMMA because they want everybody to help them make cocoa more productive and more sustainable .PERIOD
If you divide the amount of water into what the farmer was paid ,COMMA the farmer didn't receive enough money to pay a decent price for water in any of those commodities .PERIOD
This is called bundling .PERIOD It's bringing those externalities back into the price of the commodity .PERIOD
We can't just focus on identifying the best ;SEMICOLON we've got to move the rest .PERIOD
And I'm honored to meet you ,COMMA the future leaders of Great Britain and this world .PERIOD
And my mother ,COMMA the most important role model in my life ,COMMA who lives with us at the White House and helps to care for our two little daughters ,COMMA Malia and Sasha .PERIOD
That's why all of this that you're going through -- the ups and the downs ,COMMA the teachers that you love and the teachers that you don't -- why it's so important .PERIOD
And having done so ,COMMA these women moved many obstacles .PERIOD
I liked being smart .PERIOD
I liked being on time .PERIOD I liked getting my work done .PERIOD
History proves that it doesn't matter whether you come from a council estate or a country estate .PERIOD
In the White House ,COMMA there's the desk that he sits at -- it's called the Resolute desk .PERIOD
She is a world-class soprano singer who studied in Rochester ,COMMA New York .PERIOD
For me ,COMMA the human voice is the vessel on which all emotions travel -- except perhaps jealousy .PERIOD
When you're totally in the moment ,COMMA when I'm totally in the moment ,COMMA the vessel of expression is open .PERIOD
The emotions can flow from me to you and back .PERIOD
It's called Aria .PERIOD
For example ,COMMA there are different colors and each color gets a different type of singing -- pop ,COMMA country and western ,COMMA opera ,COMMA jazz -- and you just have to be consistent with that color .PERIOD
They had one great limitation and one great freedom as they tried to conceive of a global network .PERIOD
So unusual ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA that it was said that it's not clear the Internet could work .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA of course ,COMMA in a mosh pit it's hard to specify a destination .PERIOD
This is a system that relies on kindness and trust ,COMMA which also makes it very delicate and vulnerable .PERIOD
So ,COMMA for example ,COMMA last year ,COMMA the government of Pakistan asked its Internet service providers there to prevent citizens of Pakistan from seeing YouTube .PERIOD
And here is the message where one of them says ,COMMA Looks like we've got a live one .PERIOD We have a hijacking of YouTube !EXCLAMATIONMARK
And today ,COMMA Wikipedia is so ubiquitous that you can now find it on Chinese restaurant menus .PERIOD
I am not making this up .PERIOD
And there are a bunch of people who ,COMMA on a sunny day ,COMMA would rather be inside and monitoring this ,COMMA the administrator's notice board ,COMMA itself a wiki page that anyone can edit .PERIOD
There are spambots crawling it ,COMMA trying to turn every article into an ad for a Rolex watch .PERIOD
It's something they feel impelled to do because they care about it .PERIOD
Here is just a snapshot of some of them .PERIOD
If you do ,COMMA it will be removed immediately ,COMMA removed by people who may have disagreed with the original decision ,COMMA but respect the outcome and work to make it stay because they believe in something bigger than their own opinion .PERIOD
I mean ,COMMA this is a 2005 Business Week cover .PERIOD
Yeah ,COMMA I know .PERIOD Number four ,COMMA it's like ,COMMA can you imagine coming home to that cat everyday ?QUESTIONMARK
This one says ,COMMA Bucolic meadow with split-rail fence .PERIOD
And then have technology that the person taking the photo will know later ,COMMA this person requested to be contacted before this goes anywhere big ,COMMA if you don't mind .PERIOD
And that person taking the photo can make a decision about how and whether to respect it .PERIOD
And we now have means that we can build ,COMMA like this system ,COMMA so that people can report the filtering as they encounter it .PERIOD
Why ?QUESTIONMARK There is the Craigslist rideshare board .PERIOD
If it were called the Craigslist hitchhiking board ,COMMA tumbleweeds would be blowing through it .PERIOD
But it's the rideshare board ,COMMA and it's basically the same thing .PERIOD
It's a bee that ,COMMA yes ,COMMA flies .PERIOD
We all live in the same planet ,COMMA but there's still a great deal of poverty in the world .PERIOD
And by and large ,COMMA this has failed .PERIOD
Aid actually did the opposite .PERIOD
So 12 years ago ,COMMA I was trying to be an investment banker in New York .PERIOD
And it reminded me of a day in 1971 .PERIOD
And after all ,COMMA poor countries ,COMMA like rich countries ,COMMA one thing we've got equal ,COMMA is their days are the same length :COLON 24 hours .PERIOD
The question was ,COMMA how much did it cost to install a new telephone in Bangladesh ?QUESTIONMARK
It turns out :COLON 2000 dollars .PERIOD
And of course ,COMMA if the cost of installing a telephone is going down ,COMMA because there's a digital revolution going on ,COMMA then it would be even more dramatic .PERIOD
But in any event ,COMMA it's connectivity that leads to dependability .PERIOD
There were a lot of reasons people told me why we don't have enough telephones .PERIOD
The work pays them a salary ;SEMICOLON the salary allows them to pay for the car over time .PERIOD
The car pays for itself .PERIOD
See ,COMMA you need some kind of infrastructure to bring a new thing .PERIOD
For instance ,COMMA the Internet was booming in the US .PERIOD
And she sells the milk to the villagers ,COMMA and pays off the loan .PERIOD
And these phones are generating about 100 million dollars for the company .PERIOD
It's just an experiment .PERIOD
I was a guest student during one month of a public health course .PERIOD
They read the textbook twice ,COMMA or three times or four times .PERIOD
And they were the first to Twitter transatlantically .PERIOD
Those are nice words .PERIOD But I got sort of curious of what he meant with liberty ,COMMA and liberty for whom .PERIOD
But really ,COMMA really natural sovereignty was good for Japan .PERIOD
In 1947 India finally gained its independence .PERIOD
You can see that the health started to improve .PERIOD
In ' 92 India follows with a market reform .PERIOD
And they go quite closely together ,COMMA and you can see that the similarity with India and China ,COMMA in many ways ,COMMA are greater than the differences with them .PERIOD
Kerala is flying on top there ,COMMA matching United States in health ,COMMA but not in economy .PERIOD
We have an enormous disparity in the world .PERIOD
You see ,COMMA China under foreign domination actually lowered their income and came down to the Indian level here .PERIOD
Japan did it like this ,COMMA until full catch up ,COMMA and then they follow with the other high-income economies .PERIOD
Can be worse ,COMMA can be better .PERIOD
But more recently ,COMMA I've been turning my attention to the universe on the largest scale .PERIOD
By invisible ,COMMA I mean it doesn't absorb in the electromagnetic spectrum .PERIOD
When those measurements are made ,COMMA instead what we find is that the speed is basically constant ,COMMA as a function of distance .PERIOD
In fact ,COMMA this galaxy and every other galaxy appears to be embedded in a cloud of this invisible dark matter .PERIOD
It would be nice if we could see this dark matter a little bit more directly .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA how do we deduce where the galaxy is ?QUESTIONMARK
Where will this observer see the galaxy ?QUESTIONMARK
So there's a whole ray of light -- rays of light on a cone -- that will all be bent by that cluster and make it into the observer's eye .PERIOD
So ,COMMA actually ,COMMA at home ,COMMA whenever we break a wineglass ,COMMA I save the bottom ,COMMA take it over to the machine shop .PERIOD
We shave it off ,COMMA and I have a little gravitational lens ,COMMA OK .PERIOD
And we see these gravitational lensing effects ,COMMA these distortions that say that ,COMMA again ,COMMA clusters are embedded in dark matter .PERIOD
They're moving away from each other because space itself is getting bigger ,COMMA OK .PERIOD
So ,COMMA in the last century ,COMMA OK ,COMMA people debated about whether this expansion of space would continue forever ;SEMICOLON whether it would slow down ,COMMA you know ,COMMA will be slowing down ,COMMA but continue forever ;SEMICOLON slow down and stop ,COMMA asymptotically stop ;SEMICOLON or slow down ,COMMA stop ,COMMA and then reverse ,COMMA so it starts to contract again .PERIOD
By how much less is it expanding today ,COMMA compared to ,COMMA say ,COMMA a couple of billion years ago ?QUESTIONMARK
So we need something to be able to explain that .PERIOD
But we don't know if either of those are actually the dark matter candidate ,COMMA OK .PERIOD
They haven't seen anything ,COMMA OK ,COMMA but it puts limits on what the mass and the interaction strength of these dark matter particles are .PERIOD
There's going to be a satellite telescope launched later this year and it will look towards the middle of the galaxy ,COMMA to see if we can see dark matter particles annihilating and producing gamma rays that could be detected with this .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA unfortunately ,COMMA there is a lot of new physics whose signature could be missing energy ,COMMA so it will be hard to tell the difference .PERIOD
And finally ,COMMA for future endeavors ,COMMA there are telescopes being designed specifically to address the questions of dark matter and dark energy -- ground-based telescopes ,COMMA and there are three space-based telescopes that are in competition right now to be launched to investigate dark matter and dark energy .PERIOD
And over the course of half an hour ,COMMA not one syringe was filmed being unwrapped .PERIOD
They started with two and they ended with two .PERIOD
In China ,COMMA recycling is a major issue .PERIOD
And they use them ,COMMA in the breaks ,COMMA for water pistols .PERIOD
And they are having great fun .PERIOD
And they squirt the water into their mouths .PERIOD
You load it up in the normal way .PERIOD This is made on existing equipment in 14 factories that we license .PERIOD
Imagine that orchestration .PERIOD
This happens every year .PERIOD
And one time he came up to me -- he was about seven or eight years old -- he came up to me .PERIOD
And there was a wasp's nest that I had let grow in my yard ,COMMA right outside my door .PERIOD
And like ,COMMA knock like a woodpecker on my door until I opened it up .PERIOD
And I told him ,COMMA You know ,COMMA Cody ,COMMA the wasps actually made that .PERIOD
They're the people who make the bullet train .PERIOD
And those bumps act like a magnet for water .PERIOD
And the fog comes in and it builds up on the tips .PERIOD
Now it's reversing that equation ,COMMA and actually sequestering half a ton of CO 2 thanks to the recipe from the coral .PERIOD
They actually export water molecules through .PERIOD
And those scalloped edges play with flow in such a way that is reduces drag by 32 percent .PERIOD
The question is -- biomimicry is an incredibly powerful way to innovate .PERIOD
And we are in a long ,COMMA long line of organisms to come to this planet and ask ourselves ,COMMA How can we live here gracefully over the long haul ?QUESTIONMARK
Now in order to do this ,COMMA the design challenge of our century ,COMMA I think ,COMMA we need a way to remind ourselves of those geniuses ,COMMA and to somehow meet them again .PERIOD
And we're working with EOL ,COMMA Encyclopedia of Life ,COMMA Ed Wilson's TED wish .PERIOD
And this is a pretty well-educated audience ,COMMA so I imagine you all know something about AIDS .PERIOD
If you know something more ,COMMA you probably know that Uganda ,COMMA to date ,COMMA is the only country in sub-Saharan Africa that has had success in combating the epidemic .PERIOD
But I'm going to use tools and ideas that are familiar to economists to think about a problem that's more traditionally part of public health and epidemiology .PERIOD
We see almost no change in sexual behavior .PERIOD
AIDS is the same kind of thing .PERIOD It's costly to avoid AIDS .PERIOD
And the way that I'm going to do that is ,COMMA I'm going to look across areas with different levels of malaria .PERIOD
And so people who live in areas with a lot of malaria are going to have lower life expectancy than people who live in areas with limited malaria .PERIOD
Even if you only cared about AIDS in Africa ,COMMA it might still be a good idea to invest in malaria ,COMMA in combating poor indoor air quality ,COMMA in improving maternal mortality rates .PERIOD
If people have no incentive to avoid AIDS on their own ,COMMA even if they know everything about the disease ,COMMA they still may not change their behavior .PERIOD
We know they had this campaign .PERIOD That's how we learn about what works .PERIOD
So this is another way to see this .PERIOD
So I am going to talk about exports and prices .PERIOD
But openness and inter-connectedness ,COMMA it comes with a cost when we think about disease .PERIOD I don't think this should be a surprise .PERIOD
Areas with a lot of economic activity -- with a lot of roads ,COMMA with a lot of urbanization -- those areas have higher prevalence than others .PERIOD
And what's really ,COMMA really great about being here is I'm sure that the questions that you guys have are very ,COMMA very different than the questions that I think up myself .PERIOD
It's great being here at TED .PERIOD
Their relationship is a love story that feeds the Earth .PERIOD
It reminds us that we are a part of nature ,COMMA and we're not separate from it .PERIOD
Well ,COMMA their answer was ,COMMA It's all about risk and reward .PERIOD
And Chip Taylor ,COMMA our monarch butterfly expert ,COMMA he replied ,COMMA Nothing lasts forever .PERIOD
And that blew my mind .PERIOD

But the best part is the message that the Yahoo help desk got about 20 minutes later .PERIOD
CAPTCHA Project is something that we did here at Carnegie Melllon over 10 years ago ,COMMA and it's been used everywhere .PERIOD
So then I started feeling bad .PERIOD
So can we get you to do useful work for those 10 seconds ?QUESTIONMARK
So you start with a book ,COMMA and then you scan it .PERIOD
For example ,COMMA for things that were written more than 50 years ago ,COMMA the computer cannot recognize about 30 percent of the words .PERIOD
JohnEdwardscom So we keep on insulting people left and right everyday .PERIOD
There are tens of thousands of these .PERIOD
Some of them are very cute .PERIOD
And it is numbers like these that motivate my research agenda .PERIOD
It hasn't yet been launched .PERIOD It's called Duolingo .PERIOD
It started with me posing a question to my graduate student ,COMMA Severin Hacker .PERIOD
Actually it was a forum post .PERIOD
Remember ,COMMA it's a question about JavaScript .PERIOD
Okay ,COMMA so computer translation ,COMMA not yet good enough .PERIOD
We could pay professional language translators to translate the whole Web .PERIOD
We could do that .PERIOD
If we wanted to translate the other 80 percent into Spanish ,COMMA it would cost at least 50 million dollars -- and this is at even the most exploited ,COMMA outsourcing country out there .PERIOD
So it would be very expensive .PERIOD
For example ,COMMA in the United States alone ,COMMA there are over five million people who have paid over $ 500 for software to learn a new language .PERIOD
There's ,COMMA of course ,COMMA a lot of very simple sentences on the Web .PERIOD
Since all the projects that my group has worked on so far have gotten millions of users ,COMMA we're hopeful that we'll be able to translate extremely fast with this project .PERIOD
So here's the site .PERIOD
But then by the end of the decade ,COMMA the country had fallen back into political instability and mismanagement .PERIOD
We the children had gathered at a friend's house .PERIOD
I wanted to document on film the 2008 presidential elections .PERIOD
And there ,COMMA I started by searching for the footprints in my childhood .PERIOD
The polling stations opened to the voters at 700 AM ,COMMA but voters ,COMMA eager to take their own political fate into their hands ,COMMA were starting to line up at 400 AM in the morning .PERIOD
They were chanting ,COMMA We want peace .PERIOD
Now the uphill battle for Ghana and for Africa is not over ,COMMA but I have proof that the other side of democracy exists ,COMMA and that we must not take it for granted .PERIOD
That -- you know ,COMMA I was born thinking about things that way ,COMMA and I had always been like a little scientist guy .PERIOD
And people in the 17 th century ,COMMA they didn't really understand the same way we do about you know ,COMMA this stuff is a bunch of different kinds of molecules ,COMMA and we breathe it in for a purpose and all that .PERIOD
And Boyle said ,COMMA bullshit .PERIOD
And so ,COMMA Charles said ,COMMA I'm going to put up the money give you guys a building ,COMMA come here and you can meet in the building ,COMMA but just don't talk about religion in there .PERIOD
But experimental science had been tied up with all those things .PERIOD
Kary Mullis :COLON They might have done it for the teddy bear ,COMMA yeah .PERIOD
I thought that anybody with any brains will do it that way .PERIOD
I was thinking about making my own little rockets .PERIOD
That's why I thought ,COMMA as long as I don't blow my eyes out .PERIOD
I may not care about the fact that it's prohibited from heating this solution .PERIOD
I'm sure it's got to do with rockets or it wouldn't be in that manual .PERIOD
And it -- they burned .PERIOD
At any rate ,COMMA I bring it up because it's a good story ,COMMA and he said ,COMMA tell personal things ,COMMA you know ,COMMA and that's a personal -- I was going to tell you about the first night that I met my wife ,COMMA but that would be too personal ,COMMA wouldn't it .PERIOD
But in the actual process ,COMMA you get an idea -- like ,COMMA when I got the idea one night that I could amplify DNA with two oligonucleotides ,COMMA and I could make lots of copies of some little piece of DNA ,COMMA you know ,COMMA the thinking for that was about 20 minutes while I was driving my car ,COMMA and then instead of going -- I went back and I did talk to people about it ,COMMA but if I'd listened to what I heard from all my friends who were molecular biologists -- I would have abandoned it .PERIOD
But I knew ,COMMA you'd go into the lab and you'd try to make it work yourself .PERIOD And then you're the authority ,COMMA and you can say ,COMMA I know it works ,COMMA because right there in that tube is where it happened ,COMMA and here ,COMMA on this gel ,COMMA there's a little band there that I know that's DNA ,COMMA and that's the DNA I wanted to amplify ,COMMA so there !EXCLAMATIONMARK So it does work .PERIOD
So you have to be honest .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA let's see .PERIOD
They made bigger guns to shoot them down with .PERIOD
And the people I'm talking about are people that like -- they say that they're a member of the committee called ,COMMA say ,COMMA the Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change .PERIOD
So the planet should get warmer .PERIOD
So the planet is a pretty amazing thing ,COMMA you know ,COMMA it's big and horrible -- and big and wonderful ,COMMA and it does all kinds of things we don't know anything about .PERIOD
In New York City ,COMMA rats are part of commuters' daily lives .PERIOD
I was very fond of this space because it's the first massive industrial complex I found on my own that is abandoned .PERIOD
The nature had really reclaimed the whole complex .PERIOD
I was really frightened at first ,COMMA but I calmly explained to him that I was working on an art project and he didn't seem to mind and so I went ahead and put my camera on self-timer and ran back and forth .PERIOD
That homeless man ,COMMA to me ,COMMA really represented an element of the unconscious of the city .PERIOD
They were consistently dug as limestone quarries and by the 18 th century ,COMMA the caving-in of some of these quarries posed safety threats ,COMMA so the government ordered reinforcing of the existing quarries and dug new observation tunnels in order to monitor and map the whole place .PERIOD
As you can see ,COMMA the system is very complex and vast .PERIOD
I'm going to try and explain why it is that perhaps we don't understand as much as we think we do .PERIOD
I think we agree on that .PERIOD Where does the tree get the stuff that makes up this chair ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK Where does all this stuff come from ?QUESTIONMARK
And would you be able to ,COMMA kind of ,COMMA draw a -- you don't have to draw the diagram ,COMMA but would you be able to draw the diagram ,COMMA if you had to do it ?QUESTIONMARK Or would you just say ,COMMA that's actually not possible ?QUESTIONMARK
That's what plants actually do for a living .PERIOD
So ,COMMA these mental models -- we look for evidence that reinforces our models .PERIOD
And it's amateur ,COMMA but amateur in the best sense ,COMMA in other words ,COMMA the root of the word being of love and passion .PERIOD
And governments do very well .PERIOD They pat themselves on the back .PERIOD
OK ?QUESTIONMARK We collude ,COMMA and actually if you -- if someone had designed a test for me when I was doing my biology exams ,COMMA to really understand ,COMMA to see whether I'd understood more than just kind of putting starch and iodine together and seeing it go blue ,COMMA and really understood that plants took their mass out of the air ,COMMA then I might have done better at science .PERIOD
I love manipulating the infrastructure of biology .PERIOD
But within that infrastructure ,COMMA we have to remember that the driving force of biology is really coming from evolution .PERIOD
This is a dead crystal ,COMMA and I'm going to do something to it ,COMMA and it's going to become alive .PERIOD
But there's a problem ,COMMA because up until maybe a decade ago ,COMMA we were told that life was impossible and that we were the most incredible miracle in the universe .PERIOD
If we can make matter alive ,COMMA would we have a matterhazard ?QUESTIONMARK
Chemists are trying to study the molecules to look at disease .PERIOD
You can decode the genome ,COMMA you can look back ,COMMA you can link us all together by a mitochondrial DNA ,COMMA but we can't get further than the last ancestor ,COMMA the last visible cell that we could sequence or think back in history .PERIOD
What is life ?QUESTIONMARK What is this stuff of life ?QUESTIONMARK
So the whole area's been stuck for a while ,COMMA and it got reignited in the ' 80 s when analytical technologies and computer technologies were coming on .PERIOD
And the answer ,COMMA of course ,COMMA lies with mice .PERIOD
They're all made of the same stuff ,COMMA but they want their shape to win .PERIOD
And that is the key .PERIOD
Let's zoom out to what that could mean .PERIOD
If we could get evolution into the material world ,COMMA then I propose we should have a general theory of evolution .PERIOD
And that's really worth thinking about .PERIOD
So that means we could then start to develop different platforms for exploring this evolution .PERIOD
So you imagine ,COMMA if we're able to create a self-sustaining artificial life form ,COMMA not only will this tell us about the origin of life -- that it's possible that the universe doesn't need carbon to be alive ;SEMICOLON it can use anything -- we can then take [it] one step further and develop new technologies ,COMMA because we can then use software control for evolution to code in .PERIOD
But not only just that ,COMMA we will start to think about how we can start to develop a symbiotic relationship with biology .PERIOD
Evolution cannot be cut apart .PERIOD
And we're really becoming very close to understanding the key steps that makes dead stuff come alive .PERIOD
We are here today because [the] United Nations have defined goals for the progress of countries .PERIOD
Look here -- you have to end poverty ,COMMA education ,COMMA gender ,COMMA child and maternal health ,COMMA control infections ,COMMA protect the environment and get the good global links between nations in every aspect from aid to trade .PERIOD
That's a four percent reduction per year -- and this ,COMMA with measuring .PERIOD
I'll prove them wrong on both points .PERIOD
And I will take Kenya as an example .PERIOD
I was actually ,COMMA on Friday ,COMMA sitting in front of my computer ,COMMA and I saw the death rate fall from 128 to 84 just that morning .PERIOD
That's unfair .PERIOD
Had I been in the Ministry of Health in Kenya ,COMMA I may have joined these two points .PERIOD
So look at the average here -- this is the average for all of sub-Saharan Africa .PERIOD
I give you Congo ,COMMA which was high ,COMMA Ghana -- lower .PERIOD And Kenya -- even lower .PERIOD
Their countries are so different ,COMMA and they merit to be recognized in the same way ,COMMA as we don't talk about Europe as one place .PERIOD
There we are today .PERIOD
How the heck could they be [a] developing country ?QUESTIONMARK
Look -- even if we look in Africa -- these are the African countries .PERIOD
It's very clear that this is what happens .PERIOD
That is ,COMMA when we get girls in school ,COMMA we'll get an impact 15 to 20 years later ,COMMA which is a secular trend which is very strong .PERIOD
It's a decent life for children ,COMMA we are talking about .PERIOD
Do we care about those four billion people whose income levels are less than two dollars a day ,COMMA the so-called bottom of the pyramid ?QUESTIONMARK
But if you don't have money ,COMMA what happens ?QUESTIONMARK
And if they do so ,COMMA then ,COMMA of course ,COMMA the conditions improve ,COMMA and they start riding on scooters .PERIOD
An innovator is one who does not know it cannot be done .PERIOD
They combine all that .PERIOD
And it was that compassion which bothered them ,COMMA because when he saw -- in fact ,COMMA he told me about eight or nine years ago how he was driving his own car -- he drives his own car by the way -- and he saw in the rain ,COMMA a family like the one that I showed to you getting drenched with an infant .PERIOD
For example ,COMMA how we started :COLON Ratan just began with a five-engineer team ,COMMA young people in their mid-twenties .PERIOD
It was an open innovation ,COMMA ideas from all over were welcome .PERIOD

Are you getting more drugs because you are spending more time and more money ?QUESTIONMARK
The ideas have to be such that you think in completely different terms .PERIOD
And incubator costs 2000 dollars .PERIOD
But then he held it for a little while ,COMMA Lakshmi .PERIOD
That gave me a great message :COLON focus and you can achieve .PERIOD
And currently I'm president of Global Research Alliance ,COMMA 60000 scientists in nine counties ,COMMA right from India to the US .PERIOD
Commodities are things that you grow in the ground ,COMMA raise on the ground or pull out of the ground :COLON basically ,COMMA animal ,COMMA mineral ,COMMA vegetable .PERIOD
Long-distance telephone service sold on price ,COMMA price ,COMMA price ;SEMICOLON fast-food restaurants with all their value pricing ;SEMICOLON and even the Internet is commoditizing not just goods ,COMMA but services as well .PERIOD
Now most places that I talk to ,COMMA when I talk about experience ,COMMA I talk about Disney -- the world's premier experience-stager .PERIOD
And then I always finish off by talking about -- the thing that amazes me the most about this question ,COMMA particularly coming from the Dutch ,COMMA is that the Netherlands is every bit as manufactured as Disneyland .PERIOD
In fact ,COMMA you can look at how each of these economies developed ,COMMA that each one has their own business imperative ,COMMA matched with a consumer sensibility .PERIOD
Because all businesses are man-made objects ;SEMICOLON all business is involved with money ;SEMICOLON all business is a matter of using machinery ,COMMA and all those things make something inauthentic .PERIOD
At the end of a laundry list of advice he's giving to his son ,COMMA Laertes ,COMMA he says this :COLON And this above all :COLON to thine own self be true .PERIOD
As businesses ,COMMA are the economic offerings you are providing -- are they true to themselves ?QUESTIONMARK
And of course ,COMMA if you are both true to yourself ,COMMA and are what you say you are ,COMMA then you're real real !EXCLAMATIONMARK
Universal City Walk is a real fake -- in fact ,COMMA we got this very term from Ada Louise Huxtable's book ,COMMA The Unreal America .PERIOD
But is it really true to itself ?QUESTIONMARK
So she calls it a real fake .PERIOD
So ,COMMA understand what -- your past limits what you can do in the future .PERIOD
Right ,COMMA if you could check into the ads ,COMMA you'd have a great experience .PERIOD
Then you have that perception that you are phony .PERIOD
A few words about how I got started ,COMMA and it has a lot to do with happiness ,COMMA actually .PERIOD
I would make things for people as a way of ,COMMA you know ,COMMA giving ,COMMA showing them my love .PERIOD
So ,COMMA it has to end with this -- -- gratuitous violence .PERIOD
So that was how I first started to explore the way things moved ,COMMA and expressed it .PERIOD
I was also very interested in perhaps going into surgery and becoming a surgeon ,COMMA because it meant working with my hands in a very focused ,COMMA intense way .PERIOD
When I see objects ,COMMA I imagine them in motion .PERIOD
That's about that big .PERIOD
This kind of work is also very much like puppetry ,COMMA where the found object is ,COMMA in a sense ,COMMA the puppet ,COMMA and I'm the puppeteer at first ,COMMA because I'm playing with an object .PERIOD
And they would coalesce for just a moment ,COMMA so you could perceive that there was a chair there .PERIOD
What would I love ?QUESTIONMARK
So this is a little wire-bending tool .PERIOD
After many years of bending gears with a pair of pliers ,COMMA I made that tool ,COMMA and then I made this other tool for sort of centering gears very quickly -- sort of developing my own little world of technology .PERIOD
And the idea ,COMMA their premise was that we wanted to show pieces of sculpture on the street ,COMMA and there'd be no subjective decision about what was the best .PERIOD
So I'll just let this chair come down .PERIOD
And what we were going to do was scan a new project on the development of the fetus from conception to birth using these kinds of new technologies .PERIOD
25 Days :COLON Heart chamber developing 32 Days :COLON Arms &amp ;SEMICOLON hands are developing 36 Days :COLON Beginning of the primitive vertabrae These weeks are the period of the most rapid development of the fetus .PERIOD
51 Days 52 Days :COLON Developing retina ,COMMA nose and fingers The fetus' continual movement in the womb is necessary for muscular and skeletal growth .PERIOD
Every six months until they're six years old -- we're going to be doing actually to about 250 children -- watching exactly how the gyri and the sulci of the brains fold to see how this magnificent development actually turns into memories and the marvel that is us .PERIOD
I'm a spectroscopist .PERIOD
Sometimes we have to deal with just one tiny ,COMMA weak spectral line to measure the composition of that chemical element in the atmosphere .PERIOD
For instance ,COMMA you see the spectral line of the gold is the only spectral line in the spectrum of the Sun .PERIOD
It's a heavy element produced in thermonuclear explosions of supernovae .PERIOD
It's the only place where you can produce ,COMMA actually ,COMMA osmium .PERIOD
It was incredible .PERIOD The only conclusion we could make from this is clear evidence that there was a supernova explosion in this system ,COMMA which polluted the atmosphere of this star .PERIOD
They actually said that one of the stars you see in the spectra is an alien .PERIOD It comes from a different galaxy .PERIOD
And sometimes they just capture stars .PERIOD
We were very surprised to discover a super flare ,COMMA a flare which is thousands of millions of times more powerful than those we see in the Sun .PERIOD
This can be done with the future spectrographs .PERIOD
Coming back to the most important question ,COMMA Is there anybody out there ?QUESTIONMARK
Connection between life and radioactive nuclei is straightforward .PERIOD
It's exactly the same game .PERIOD A very tiny feature .PERIOD
It's amazing that we can detect vegetation from a spectrum .PERIOD
Now very recently ,COMMA very recently ,COMMA I'm talking about last six ,COMMA seven ,COMMA eight months ,COMMA water ,COMMA methane ,COMMA carbon dioxide have been detected in the spectrum of a planet outside the solar system .PERIOD
And with the known physics etc ,COMMA it's something actually which has been pointed out by Frank Drake ,COMMA many years ago ,COMMA and Shklovsky .PERIOD
They want to actually signal their presence through these spectral lines ,COMMA in the spectrum of a star ,COMMA in different ways .PERIOD
And we are doing this job since 2000 and it's a very heavy project .PERIOD
We have been working very hard .PERIOD
I think it will come from a spectrum like this .PERIOD
It will take about five years .PERIOD
And she said ,COMMA But the thing I liked about your talk is you're a storyteller .PERIOD
And she said ,COMMA I'm going to call you a storyteller .PERIOD
I'm a qualitative researcher .PERIOD
And maybe I'm just a storyteller .PERIOD
The other thing that they had in common was this :COLON They fully embraced vulnerability .PERIOD
They're willing to invest in a relationship that may or may not work out .PERIOD
Do you have any recommendations ?QUESTIONMARK
And I said ,COMMA I'm great .PERIOD I'm okay .PERIOD
I just need some strategies .PERIOD
And then I said ,COMMA It's bad ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK
The problem is -- and I learned this from the research -- that you cannot selectively numb emotion .PERIOD
You can't numb those hard feelings without numbing the other affects ,COMMA our emotions .PERIOD
Religion has gone from a belief in faith and mystery to certainty .PERIOD
There's no conversation .PERIOD
Which just ,COMMA I hope in 100 years ,COMMA people will look back and go ,COMMA Wow .PERIOD
And when you hold those perfect little babies in your hand ,COMMA our job is not to say ,COMMA Look at her ,COMMA she's perfect .PERIOD
My job is just to keep her perfect -- make sure she makes the tennis team by fifth grade and Yale by seventh grade .PERIOD
We do that in our personal lives .PERIOD
It is ,COMMA as you can see ,COMMA very small and also very cheap .PERIOD
So that when we think about using them to get some systematic improvement ,COMMA we also think about how they can be useful for self-improvement ,COMMA for self-discovery ,COMMA self-awareness ,COMMA self-knowledge .PERIOD
Some people will say it's for public health research .PERIOD
Thank you .PERIOD
I want to talk about it in the context of a story .PERIOD
All of our statuses are different .PERIOD
All of our hopes and dreams ,COMMA what we want to accomplish ,COMMA is different ,COMMA and our paths will be different ,COMMA they are all stories .PERIOD
and go from this concept of walking ,COMMA breathing ,COMMA and then his hands ,COMMA speak ,COMMA and ultimately happiness and function .PERIOD
And we took this ,COMMA and we converted it into data .PERIOD
But it's not a data point at that one moment in time .PERIOD
So ,COMMA here's Steven alone ,COMMA sharing this story in the world .PERIOD
We need to give to others to be successful .PERIOD
And I'm going to show you what Patients Like Me ,COMMA the company that myself ,COMMA my youngest brother and a good friend from MIT started .PERIOD
But you can aggregate this and you can discover things about treatments .PERIOD
So ,COMMA you can see the duration .PERIOD
I'm going to log in .PERIOD
And this is a new version of our platform we're launching right now .PERIOD
I'm taking three drugs to manage it .PERIOD Some of them are experimental .PERIOD
So ,COMMA can I take this data -- rearrange yourself ,COMMA put the symptoms in the left ,COMMA the drugs across the top ,COMMA tell me everything we know about Steven and everyone else ,COMMA and what interacts .PERIOD
Doctors actually love this sheet ,COMMA and they're actually really engaged .PERIOD
Ten percent of the people in our system took lithium .PERIOD
It's never going to work .PERIOD You can't do it .PERIOD
And then we say ,COMMA Well how do we line them all up ?QUESTIONMARK
And it works almost every time .PERIOD
And yeah ,COMMA all the clinicians in the audience will talk about power and all the standard deviation .PERIOD We'll do that later .PERIOD
We hired them ,COMMA set them up ,COMMA assisting at lab .PERIOD
Because something went different .PERIOD
And I am thankful .PERIOD
We know what they are .PERIOD
The B 15 iceberg broke off the Ross Ice Shelf .PERIOD
And what if we could get exquisite control over the essence of energy ,COMMA the electron ?QUESTIONMARK
A tremendous amount of energy is coming at us from the sun .PERIOD
Wouldn't it be really great if the window could flick back the heat into the room if we needed it or flick it away before it came in ?QUESTIONMARK
We'd have to see at night ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK
But because it's flexible ,COMMA it can be on any surface whatsoever .PERIOD
It was in actually a diner outside of Dallas/Fort Worth Airport .PERIOD
EBox is testing new nanomaterials to park an electron on the outside ,COMMA hold it until you need it ,COMMA and then be able to release it and pass it off .PERIOD
19 trillion dollars is what we're going to have to spend .PERIOD
I'm glad to be working with incredibly brilliant and kind scientists ,COMMA no kinder than many of the people in the world ,COMMA but they have a magic look at the world .PERIOD
By any standard this is wrong .PERIOD
I was two years older than my sister at the time -- I mean ,COMMA I'm two years older than her now -- but at the time it meant she had to do everything that I wanted to do ,COMMA and I wanted to play war .PERIOD
And on the other side were all my sister's My Little Ponies ready for a cavalry charge .PERIOD
I was nervous because my parents had charged me with making sure that my sister and I played as safely and as quietly as possible .PERIOD
with one broken leg .PERIOD
I can delete that dot because that's clearly a measurement error .PERIOD
So one of the very first things we teach people in economics and statistics and business and psychology courses is how ,COMMA in a statistically valid way ,COMMA do we eliminate the weirdos .PERIOD
When I applied to Harvard ,COMMA I applied on a dare .PERIOD
I didn't expect to get in ,COMMA and my family had no money for college .PERIOD
Which I'm glad you liked ,COMMA but they did not like that at all .PERIOD
Here's how we get to health :COLON We need to reverse the formula for happiness and success .PERIOD
Doctors are 19 percent faster ,COMMA more accurate at coming up with the correct diagnosis when positive instead of negative ,COMMA neutral or stressed .PERIOD
What we need to be able to do is to reverse this formula so we can start to see what our brains are actually capable of .PERIOD
Exercise teaches your brain that your behavior matters .PERIOD
And by the way ,COMMA all of these numbers are significantly higher if you happen to be black ,COMMA if you happen to be poor ,COMMA if you happen to exist in an overcrowded school .PERIOD
And so we're starting to see the establishment of men centers and men studies to think about how do we engage men in their experiences in the university .PERIOD
The next reason that boys' cultures are out of sync with school cultures :COLON there are fewer male teachers .PERIOD
But male role models for boys that say it's all right to be smart -- they've got dads ,COMMA they've got pastors ,COMMA they've got Cub Scout leaders ,COMMA but ultimately ,COMMA six hours a day ,COMMA five days a week they're spending in a classroom ,COMMA and most of those classrooms are not places where men exist .PERIOD
This is a place for girls .PERIOD
We have a serious compression of the curriculum happening out there .PERIOD
And if you ask Title 1 teachers ,COMMA they'll tell you they've got about four or five boys for every girl that's in their program ,COMMA in the elementary grades .PERIOD
All of those conversations need to be happening .PERIOD
Who has a computer ?QUESTIONMARK Yeah .PERIOD
OK ,COMMA so ,COMMA everyone has a computer .PERIOD
I went to MIT ,COMMA did my math ,COMMA but I had this wonderful opportunity ,COMMA because computers had just become visual .PERIOD
Remember that moment -- publishing your designs ?QUESTIONMARK
I didn't quite get it .PERIOD And Paul Rand was a kind of crusty designer ,COMMA you know ,COMMA a crusty designer ,COMMA like a good -- kind of like a good French bread ?QUESTIONMARK
This is the first sort of play thing I did ,COMMA my own serious play .PERIOD
This is actually bad :COLON human experiments .PERIOD
See ,COMMA humans don't know how to take orders ;SEMICOLON the computer's so good at it .PERIOD
This guy figured out how to get the computer to draw with two pens at once :COLON you know ,COMMA you ,COMMA pen ,COMMA do this ,COMMA and you ,COMMA pen ,COMMA do this .PERIOD
And after this I wanted to build a computer out of people ,COMMA called a human-powered computer .PERIOD
I have behind this wall a disk drive ,COMMA a CPU ,COMMA a graphics card ,COMMA a memory system .PERIOD
On the computer ,COMMA when you move your mouse ,COMMA that arrow moves around .PERIOD
I have no staff ;SEMICOLON it's all kind of made by hand -- these sort of broken hands .PERIOD
So ,COMMA Naomi was pivotal in that .PERIOD
So ,COMMA if you can see here ,COMMA you know ,COMMA that program you're seeing in the corner ,COMMA if you spread it out ,COMMA it's all these things all at once .PERIOD
You get it ?QUESTIONMARK No ?QUESTIONMARK OK .PERIOD
They're littler computers ,COMMA so the one-chip computers ,COMMA I began to program one-chip computers and make objects out of PC .PERIOD boards ,COMMA LEDs .PERIOD
I did a show in London last year made out of iPods -- I used iPods as a material .PERIOD
We have this gene defect in our mind .PERIOD
This is from the Cape last year .PERIOD
This is also out there ,COMMA you know .PERIOD
And I went after it with passion .PERIOD
I was ,COMMA like ,COMMA aha ,COMMA wait a second .PERIOD
So ,COMMA thank you everyone .PERIOD
What is it about flying cars ?QUESTIONMARK
But we haven't yet gotten to the point where on your way here this morning you see something that really ,COMMA truly seamlessly integrates the two-dimensional world that we're comfortable in with the three-dimensional sky above us -- that ,COMMA I don't know about you ,COMMA but I really enjoy spending time in .PERIOD
For those of us that spend most of our lives on the ground ,COMMA this may be counter-intuitive ,COMMA but driving has potholes ,COMMA cobblestones ,COMMA pedestrians ,COMMA other drivers and a rather long and detailed list of federal motor vehicle safety standards to contend with .PERIOD

Because actually ,COMMA never mind the actual intrinsic value of having gold jewelry .PERIOD This actually had symbolic value ,COMMA badge value .PERIOD
If you think about it ,COMMA Shakerism was a proto-environmental movement .PERIOD
And that what we add on top is kind of false .PERIOD It's a fake version .PERIOD
However ,COMMA what we do have now is a much more variegated media ecosystem in which to kind of create this kind of value ,COMMA and it's much fairer .PERIOD
Yet we've never created the opportunity for impulse saving .PERIOD
I would say it's a work of genius .PERIOD
So I just want to get your first impressions when you see that ,COMMA when you see the Diamond Shreddies box there .PERIOD
But it's kind of like flipping a six or a nine .PERIOD Like a six ,COMMA if you flip it over it looks like a nine .PERIOD
Thank you very much indeed .PERIOD

After all ,COMMA it was the buildings ,COMMA not the earthquake ,COMMA that killed 220000 people ,COMMA that injured 330000 ,COMMA that displaced 13 million people ,COMMA that cut off food and water and supplies for an entire nation .PERIOD
Behind that door is the National Judicial Archives .PERIOD
Now there's a solution to all these problems .PERIOD
And because I had 70 percent of my body burned ,COMMA it would take about an hour .PERIOD
So originally I didn't have much money ,COMMA so I went to a hardware store and I bought a carpenter's vice .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA Ten Commandments is something that is hard to bring into the education system ,COMMA so we said ,COMMA Why don't we get people to sign the honor code ?QUESTIONMARK
And this is particularly interesting ,COMMA because MIT doesn't have an honor code .PERIOD
No bill ever disappeared .PERIOD
We did not pay them with dollars ;SEMICOLON we paid them with something else .PERIOD
But this did not solve the big problem I had with Enron yet ,COMMA because in Enron ,COMMA there's also a social element .PERIOD
So everybody got an envelope with all the money for the experiment ,COMMA and we told them that at the end ,COMMA we asked them to pay us back the money they didn't make .PERIOD OK ?QUESTIONMARK
What would happen to the other people in the group ?QUESTIONMARK
Will they cheat more ,COMMA or will they cheat less ?QUESTIONMARK
All of the subjects sitting in the experiment were Carnegie Mellon students .PERIOD
When we remind people about their morality ,COMMA they cheat less .PERIOD
But unless we start testing those intuitions ,COMMA we're not going to do better .PERIOD
Okay .PERIOD
Well ,COMMA cèilidh first of all is Gaelic for party ,COMMA but kitchen party in Cape Breton is very common ,COMMA and basically somebody drops into the house ,COMMA and no matter what house you go to in Cape Breton ,COMMA there's a fiddle there ,COMMA guaranteed ,COMMA and I'd say ,COMMA well there's first of all more fiddlers per capita in Cape Breton than anywhere in the world ,COMMA so ten chances to one ,COMMA the fellow who walked in the door could play it ,COMMA so you'd have someone come into the house ,COMMA you'd invite them to play a tune ,COMMA and lo and behold a little party would start up and somebody would dance ,COMMA and somebody would sing ,COMMA and all that sort of thing ,COMMA so it was a wonderful ,COMMA wonderful way to grow up ,COMMA and that is where my beginnings in music come from :COLON my surroundings ,COMMA my family ,COMMA just my bloodline in itself ,COMMA and ,COMMA oh ,COMMA I've done lots of things with my music .PERIOD
Donnell Leahy :COLON Thank you .PERIOD I'm kind of new to the TED experience and I'm glad to be here ,COMMA but I'm just trying to put it all together ,COMMA trying to figure all you people out ,COMMA and I've been here for a short while ,COMMA and I'm starting to understand a little bit better .PERIOD
We learned to play the instruments ,COMMA but we kind of had to come from within or go from within ,COMMA because we didn't watch television ,COMMA we didn't listen to a lot of radio .PERIOD We went to church and to school sometimes ,COMMA and farmed and played music ,COMMA so we were able ,COMMA I think ,COMMA at a very critical age to develop our own style ,COMMA our own self ,COMMA and my mother plays ,COMMA my father plays ,COMMA and the style that came from the Ottawa Valley in Ontario ,COMMA we call it French-Canadian style but it originated in logging camps .PERIOD

So I quit my job and decided that that's the subject that I wanted to tackle .PERIOD
We've known about fusion since 1920 ,COMMA when Sir Arthur Stanley Eddington and the British Association for the Advancement of Science conjectured that that's why the sun shines .PERIOD
And once it was sort of explained to me how fast we were using up the world's resources ,COMMA I got very upset ,COMMA about as upset as I did when I realized that the Earth will only last about five billion years before it's swallowed by the sun .PERIOD
Energy ,COMMA at the moment ,COMMA is dominated by resource .PERIOD
It's a medium-sized nucleus .PERIOD
And indeed that's exactly what stars do .PERIOD
So ,COMMA that's that process there .PERIOD Deuterium and tritium goes together makes helium 5 .PERIOD
And that energy is what powers fusion .PERIOD
And as you go across there you see a few tens of years of oil -- the blue line ,COMMA by the way ,COMMA is the lowest estimate of existing resources .PERIOD
And as you go across there you will see that we've got a few tens of years ,COMMA and perhaps 100 years of fossil fuels left .PERIOD
So ,COMMA how would we make it ?QUESTIONMARK
We can do fusion .PERIOD In the center of this device we made 16 megawatts of fusion power in 1997 .PERIOD
If you want to know how ,COMMA ask yourself this question :COLON What would you attempt to do if you knew you could not fail ?QUESTIONMARK
Because when you ask it ,COMMA you begin to understand how the fear of failure constrains you ,COMMA how it keeps us from attempting great things ,COMMA and life gets dull ,COMMA amazing things stop happening .PERIOD
The path to truly new ,COMMA never-been-done-before things always has failure along the way .PERIOD
In October of 1903 ,COMMA the prevailing opinion of expert aerodynamicists was that maybe in 10 million years we could build an aircraft that would fly .PERIOD
40 years later ,COMMA aero experts coined the term transonic .PERIOD
Since we took to the sky ,COMMA we have wanted to fly faster and farther .PERIOD
It's boosted to near-space atop a Minotaur IV rocket .PERIOD
That's an unnatural act for a rocket .PERIOD

Now to conceal the shape ,COMMA we changed the aspect ratio a little bit .PERIOD
This is a hummingbird drone .PERIOD

Well I don't think we ultimately know what it will be ,COMMA right .PERIOD
It's actually ,COMMA Look at that cute hummingbird flying into my headquarters .PERIOD
Well look ,COMMA our singular mission is the creation and prevention of strategic surprise .PERIOD
That's what we do .PERIOD
And you persuade people to go to these great feats of invention ,COMMA but at a personal level ,COMMA in a way I can't imagine doing your job .PERIOD
But ,COMMA quite frankly ,COMMA on this issue ,COMMA there is no other road .PERIOD
Sorry ,COMMA this was my mother ,COMMA by the way ,COMMA in her bead shop in London .PERIOD
Because just that soil could make the acoustic difference .PERIOD
And the British government saying ,COMMA You need to be in the top five .PERIOD
But you just have to go to a garden center ,COMMA and they're in little paper packets .PERIOD
And so there was one particular toy that gave us a clue .PERIOD
And the government agreed to do that and not do anything else ,COMMA and focus our energy on that .PERIOD
This is the only project that we've done where the finished thing looked more like a rendering than our renderings .PERIOD
I'm sorry about my stupid voice there .PERIOD
So if we could chop that away and give the building a small bottom ,COMMA we could take that bit and put it at the top where the greater commercial value is for a property developer .PERIOD
Thank you .PERIOD
June Cohen :COLON So thank you .PERIOD Thank you ,COMMA Thomas .PERIOD You're a delight .PERIOD
Well that fundamental sense of oneness is lost on us very quickly .PERIOD
The self changed ,COMMA got affected ,COMMA broken ,COMMA destroyed ,COMMA but another one would evolve -- sometimes stronger ,COMMA sometimes hateful ,COMMA sometimes not wanting to be there at all .PERIOD
The self was not constant .PERIOD
But nature had its wicked way ,COMMA and brown babies were born .PERIOD
It was the first time that I existed inside a fully-functioning self -- one that I controlled ,COMMA that I steered ,COMMA that I gave life to .PERIOD
Well ,COMMA I thought I had the answer to that one ,COMMA and I said ,COMMA Skin color .PERIOD
For a start ,COMMA we can think about all the times when we do lose ourselves .PERIOD
I take it to therapy .PERIOD
And in that disconnected state ,COMMA yeah ,COMMA we can build factory farms with no windows ,COMMA destroy marine life and use rape as a weapon of war .PERIOD
Thank you for listening .PERIOD
You can see my fellow riders at the end of the picture ,COMMA looking at me with some concern .PERIOD
And here is another picture of them .PERIOD
They are supposed to be locked up .PERIOD
And I became increasingly more and more agitated ,COMMA because I was there not only to be with them ,COMMA but also to ride and create a team and I didn't know what to do .PERIOD
We're going downhill in some rocky terrain ,COMMA and the front tire of Alex gets caught in one of these crevasses here .PERIOD
I've had it .PERIOD
It took me several such incidents to figure out what I was supposed to do .PERIOD
At the beginning ,COMMA it was a disaster .PERIOD
I tried harsh words and threats and they took me nowhere .PERIOD
Go away you maniac-psychopath .PERIOD
And I would say ,COMMA Relax ,COMMA Alex .PERIOD
So ,COMMA for such a kid ,COMMA when an adult that he learns to respect stays close to him and doesn't walk away from him in any situation ,COMMA irrespective of how he behaves ,COMMA it's a tremendous healing experience .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA I come from a cutthroat world of science and high technology .PERIOD
I used to think that reason and logic and relentless drive were the only ways to make things happen .PERIOD
All you have to do is play with it ,COMMA change it a little bit ,COMMA and come up with something that does help ,COMMA that does work .PERIOD
Or you can also look back in time and realize that you've already conquered steeper mountains before .PERIOD
And so we talked about these special words that we teach them .PERIOD
In every one of these rides I always end up standing in one of these incredible locations ,COMMA taking in this incredible landscape around me ,COMMA and I feel blessed and fortunate that I'm alive ,COMMA and that I sense every fiber in my aching body .PERIOD
The blank slate was an influential idea in the 20 th century .PERIOD
This is a recent study by the neurobiologist Paul Thompson and his colleagues in which they -- using MRI -- measured the distribution of gray matter -- that is ,COMMA the outer layer of the cortex -- in a large sample of pairs of people .PERIOD
And as you can see ,COMMA large amounts of the brain are not purple ,COMMA showing that if one person has a thicker bit of cortex in that region ,COMMA so does his fraternal twin .PERIOD
And here's what happens if you get a pair of people who share all their DNA -- namely ,COMMA clones or identical twins .PERIOD
Another political fear of human nature is that if we are blank slates ,COMMA we can perfect mankind -- the age-old dream of the perfectibility of our species through social engineering .PERIOD
And so when Thomas Jefferson wrote in the Declaration of Independence ,COMMA We hold these truths to be self-evident ,COMMA that all men are created equal ,COMMA he did not mean We hold these truths to be self-evident ,COMMA that all men are clones .PERIOD
That is because the human mind is a complex system with many parts ,COMMA and some of them can inhibit others .PERIOD
For example ,COMMA there's excellent reason to believe that virtually all humans are born with a moral sense ,COMMA and that we have cognitive abilities that allow us to profit from the lessons of history .PERIOD
Well ,COMMA the night is young ,COMMA but the book has been out for half a year ,COMMA and nothing terrible has happened .PERIOD
Visual arts -- decoration of surfaces and bodies -- appears to be a human universal .PERIOD
A paraphrase of a quote by Virginia Woolf ,COMMA and there's some debate as to what she actually meant by that .PERIOD
I mean ,COMMA this is perhaps a representative example of the visual depiction of the female form in the 15 th century ;SEMICOLON here is a representative example of the depiction of the female form in the 20 th century .PERIOD
Well ,COMMA this turned out to be probably the most controversial claim in the book .PERIOD

I mean ,COMMA these are the people that I work with every single day .PERIOD
Because ,COMMA dude ,COMMA you know ,COMMA four years .PERIOD

They know that other things come first -- the business of doing the work comes first ,COMMA the business of getting it done .PERIOD
Most hazardous environment I'd ever seen ,COMMA and I was back with a guy ,COMMA lashing the pots down .PERIOD
I scamper down ,COMMA I go into the wheelhouse and I say ,COMMA with some level of incredulity ,COMMA Captain ,COMMA OSHA .PERIOD
It goes like this -- we've declared war on work ,COMMA as a society ,COMMA all of us .PERIOD
We turn them into heroes ,COMMA or we turn them into punch lines .PERIOD
I just know that that's a front in this war .PERIOD
And I realized ,COMMA probably too late in this game -- I hope not ,COMMA because I don't know if I can do 200 more of these things -- but we're going to do as many as we can .PERIOD
It's been great talking to you and get back to work ,COMMA will you ?QUESTIONMARK
Democracy ,COMMA as a type of politics ,COMMA is a technology for the control and deployment of power .PERIOD
I would put it in the following equation :COLON no 9 / 11 ,COMMA no war .PERIOD
Islam represents a way of engaging the world through which one can achieve certain desirable goals .PERIOD
You can show the Capitol -- I had the same problem when I was designing the cover of my forthcoming book ,COMMA in fact -- what do you put on the cover to show democracy ?QUESTIONMARK
You can show a mosque ,COMMA or you can show worshippers ,COMMA but there's not a straightforward way of depicting Islam .PERIOD
These are contested points ,COMMA and it's impossible to answer them by saying ,COMMA Ah ha ,COMMA I looked in the right place ,COMMA and I found out what these concepts mean .PERIOD
And I think that that's ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA probably the first appropriate response .PERIOD
And the hopeful response derives from recognizing that Islam and democracy are technologies .PERIOD
And they're making this argument wherever they're permitted to make it .PERIOD
They were actually blocked from even forming a party under the political system there .PERIOD Why ?QUESTIONMARK
Now what I want to suggest to you is that the reason for hope in this case is that we are on the edge of a real transformation in the Muslim world .PERIOD
When these heartbreaking images of oiled birds finally began to emerge from the Gulf of Mexico last year during the horrific BP oil spill ,COMMA a German biologist by the name of Silvia Gaus was quoted as saying ,COMMA We should just euthanize all oiled birds because studies have shown that fewer than one percent of them survive after being released .PERIOD
And the local seabird rescue center ,COMMA named SANCCOB ,COMMA immediately launched a massive rescue operation -- and this soon would become the largest animal rescue ever undertaken .PERIOD
I was a penguin aquarist at the New England Aquarium .PERIOD
I was instantly transported back to that moment in time .PERIOD
So for the few of us that were there in a professional capacity ,COMMA this extraordinary volunteer response to this animal crisis was profoundly moving and awe-inspiring .PERIOD
Now mind you ,COMMA three days earlier ,COMMA we had 60 penguins under our care ,COMMA so we were definitely overwhelmed and just a bit terrified -- at least I was .PERIOD
And you may notice they're wearing very thick gloves .PERIOD
He said ,COMMA Okay ,COMMA why don't we try and collect the birds at the greatest risk of getting oiled -- they collected 20000 -- and we'll ship them 500 miles up the coast to Port Elizabeth in these open air trucks and release them into the clean waters there and let them swim back home .PERIOD
About a year prior to this oil spill ,COMMA a 17 year-old student had invented a degreaser .PERIOD
Just look at that 17 year-old .PERIOD
And the two main threats to penguins today are overfishing and global warming .PERIOD
And I was doing some rather controversial religious programs .PERIOD
This went down very well in the UK ,COMMA where religion is extremely unpopular .PERIOD
Indeed ,COMMA some of the world traditions think very little of religious orthodoxy .PERIOD
You behave in a committed way ,COMMA and then you begin to understand the truths of religion .PERIOD
Why ?QUESTIONMARK Because in compassion ,COMMA when we feel with the other ,COMMA we dethrone ourselves from the center of our world and we put another person there .PERIOD And once we get rid of ego ,COMMA then we're ready to see the Divine .PERIOD
And in particular ,COMMA every single one of the major world traditions has highlighted -- has said -- and put at the core of their tradition what's become known as the Golden Rule .PERIOD
Hillel stood on one leg and said ,COMMA That which is hateful to you ,COMMA do not do to your neighbor .PERIOD That is the Torah .PERIOD The rest is commentary .PERIOD
So the traditions also insisted -- and this is an important point ,COMMA I think -- that you could not and must not confine your compassion to your own group :COLON your own nation ,COMMA your own co-religionists ,COMMA your own fellow countrymen .PERIOD You must have what one of the Chinese sages called jian ai :COLON concern for everybody .PERIOD Love your enemies .PERIOD Honor the stranger .PERIOD
And this ,COMMA again -- this universal outreach -- is getting subdued in the strident use of religion -- abuse of religion -- for nefarious gains .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA I've lost count of the number of taxi drivers who ,COMMA when I say to them what I do for a living ,COMMA inform me that religion has been the cause of all the major world wars in history .PERIOD Wrong .PERIOD
Because it seems to me that with -- our current situation is so serious at the moment that any ideology that doesn't promote a sense of global understanding and global appreciation of each other is failing the test of the time .PERIOD
I was part of that United Nations initiative called the Alliance of Civilizations ,COMMA which was asked by Kofi Annan to diagnose the causes of extremism ,COMMA and to give practical guidelines to member states about how to avoid the escalation of further extremism .PERIOD
It was just one of those pot-luck things where you get it right first time .PERIOD
Moving on to something a bit larger ,COMMA this is an X-ray of a bus .PERIOD
It's not just Topshop ,COMMA I get some strange looks when I go out getting my props .PERIOD

In fact ,COMMA that is three months solid X-raying .PERIOD

So ,COMMA I like to use them .PERIOD
That flower doesn't come in bright orange ,COMMA I don't think .PERIOD
I'm now going to show you a short film ,COMMA I'll step to the side .PERIOD

I look out the window ,COMMA and I realize that every single time we stop and I look out that window ,COMMA framed in that window ,COMMA wherever we are ,COMMA I am observing more life than there is in the rest of the known universe beyond the planet Earth .PERIOD
That ,COMMA to me ,COMMA is an incredible thing .PERIOD
I began The Vagina Monologues because I was worried about vaginas .PERIOD
What does anyone mean when they talk about real security ?QUESTIONMARK
This is ,COMMA of course ,COMMA unless your whole life is about being secure .PERIOD
You become whatever it is that will freeze you ,COMMA numb you and protect you from doubt or change .PERIOD
But all this does ,COMMA actually ,COMMA is shut down your mind .PERIOD
One of the amazing things that I've discovered in my travels is that there is this emerging species .PERIOD
I've discovered these people ,COMMA who ,COMMA in V-Day world ,COMMA we call Vagina Warriors .PERIOD
They raised 10000 dollars on a production that never occurred .PERIOD
Now this seems like a fairly ,COMMA you know ,COMMA frivolous ,COMMA but what happened as a result of that ,COMMA is that that school now is forming a sex education class .PERIOD It's beginning to talk about sex ,COMMA it's beginning to look at why it would be wrong for a young high school girl to talk about her vagina publicly or to say that she loved her vagina publicly .PERIOD
In the years that she walked ,COMMA she educated parents ,COMMA mothers ,COMMA fathers .PERIOD
Real security is contemplating death ,COMMA not pretending it doesn't exist .PERIOD
And I think part of what I'm learning in this process is that one must allow oneself to feel grief .PERIOD
Now I was stupid ,COMMA but not so stupid that I turned it down .PERIOD
It is the story factory ,COMMA one of the very best in the world .PERIOD
But they all have one thing in common :COLON They all need to look like something .PERIOD
They all need a face .PERIOD
The first was Katharine Hepburn's memoirs ,COMMA and the second was a biography of Marlene Dietrich .PERIOD
So the Hepburn story is words and the Dietrich story is pictures ,COMMA and so we did this .PERIOD
And what I ended up with was a graphic representation of us seeing this animal coming into being .PERIOD
No ,COMMA that is not me .PERIOD
That's a responsibility .PERIOD
A book cover is a distillation .PERIOD

Huhh !EXCLAMATIONMARK And now the sultan is in danger .PERIOD

The students should teach their teachers .PERIOD
Well ,COMMA we heard that one too ,COMMA but Pioneer Germ Fighters totally rules .PERIOD
Instead of just scoffing at this heresy that a kid wanted to get published or saying wait until you're older ,COMMA my parents were really supportive .PERIOD
The school I went to was pretty boring .PERIOD
And that was the finishing post right there .PERIOD
But our school at that time got a grant from the government ,COMMA and they got an incredible computer -- the research machine 3 DZ -- and they left the programming manuals lying around .PERIOD
That's what they thought they had built it for .PERIOD
This is one of my favorite ones here ,COMMA where they have rabbit breeding ,COMMA so males choose the lucky rabbit .PERIOD
So I went on for the next 20 years or so making a lot of different games .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA Chris did ask me to bring some statistics with me ,COMMA so I've done that .PERIOD
But 83 percent of games don't have any mature content whatsoever ,COMMA so it's just not true .PERIOD
It makes about 80 million bucks a month in subscriptions .PERIOD
I wanted to update that video and give you a new look at it .PERIOD
I played in the backyard ,COMMA learned to read ,COMMA and even ate some of my vegetables .PERIOD
But as was the case for most of my generation ,COMMA I spent a lot of time in front of the TV .PERIOD
Their importance blends into the sensationalized drama of prime time TV .PERIOD

She's never going to know a world where video games aren't incredibly emotional and will probably make her cry .PERIOD
Chris Anderson :COLON David Perry .PERIOD That was awesome .PERIOD
It's this change in perspective on what it is we think we're perceiving that has helped us make more progress in the last 400 years than we have in the rest of human history .PERIOD
So one of the things that goes from simple to complex is when we do more .PERIOD We like more .PERIOD
And in fact ,COMMA what Murray was talking about yesterday in the fractal beauty of nature -- of having the descriptions at various levels be rather similar -- all goes down to the idea that the elementary particles are both sticky and standoffish ,COMMA and they're in violent motion .PERIOD
Not because it wasn't beautiful or anything ,COMMA but because it misses the thing that most students fail to understand about molecular biology ,COMMA and that is :COLON why is there any probability at all of two complex shapes finding each other just the right way so they combine together and be catalyzed ?QUESTIONMARK
So they had created these artifacts .PERIOD

Directly going in -- it's a little bit further away ,COMMA but not that far away -- going in and altering the genes in the first cell in an embryo .PERIOD
People can try and ban these things .PERIOD
Other people are going to say ,COMMA This is great .PERIOD
And from the beginning of today's sessions you'd think that they're going to see this as this horrible difficult ,COMMA painful period that we struggled through .PERIOD
And I don't think that's what's going to happen .PERIOD
They are going to think about it as this glorious instant when we laid down the very foundations of their lives ,COMMA of their society ,COMMA of their future .PERIOD

If you go back two billion years ,COMMA you're not on an Earth-like planet any more .PERIOD
What we call an Earth-like planet is actually a very short interval of time .PERIOD
We are right now in the beautiful Oreo of existence -- of at least life on Planet Earth -- following the first horrible microbial age .PERIOD
We have as much time for animals to exist on this planet as they have been here now ,COMMA till we hit the second microbial age .PERIOD
And that's the fate of a planet ,COMMA too .PERIOD
All along it was thought to be either an act of God or perhaps long ,COMMA slow climate change ,COMMA and that really changed in 1980 ,COMMA in this rocky outcrop near Gubbio ,COMMA where Walter Alvarez ,COMMA trying to figure out what was the time difference between these white rocks ,COMMA which held creatures of the Cretaceous period ,COMMA and the pink rocks above ,COMMA which held Tertiary fossils .PERIOD

Because I realized that if we could find a way to target remediation ,COMMA we could also find a way to treat asthmatic patients more effectively .PERIOD
These chemical pollutants are currently not a criteria air pollutant ,COMMA as defined by the US .PERIOD Clean Air Act .PERIOD

The really neat thing about this stuff is that's life .PERIOD
And in the measure that we learn how chickens grow wings ,COMMA and what the program is for those cells to differentiate ,COMMA one of the things we're going to be able to do is to stop undifferentiated cells ,COMMA which you know as cancer ,COMMA and one of the things we're going to learn how to do is how to reprogram cells like stem cells in such a way that they express bone ,COMMA stomach ,COMMA skin ,COMMA pancreas .PERIOD

They have this very continuous feedback loop .PERIOD
They said ,COMMA You roll the ball ,COMMA you hear some pins go down .PERIOD

The government noticed in Ethiopia that many of the people were so far away from a health clinic ,COMMA they were over a day's travel away from a health clinic .PERIOD
The third component of Coke's success is marketing .PERIOD

This is really destructive .PERIOD
David Milch ,COMMA creator of Deadwood and other amazing TV shows ,COMMA has a really good description for this .PERIOD

So I can diagnose the problem a little more specifically in math .PERIOD
The math serves the conversation ,COMMA the conversation doesn't serve the math .PERIOD
I like this question .PERIOD It's about a water tank .PERIOD
I've got kids who are mathematically and conversationally intimidated joining the conversation .PERIOD
We need more patient problem solvers .PERIOD Thank you .PERIOD
Because actually radical innovation does sometimes come from the very best ,COMMA but it often comes from places where you have huge need -- unmet ,COMMA latent demand -- and not enough resources for traditional solutions to work -- traditional ,COMMA high-cost solutions ,COMMA which depend on professionals ,COMMA which is what schools and hospitals are .PERIOD
We'll grow by six cities of 12 million people a year for the next 30 years .PERIOD
This is where you'll find the fastest growing young populations of the world .PERIOD
Or you can go to places like this .PERIOD
This is Kibera ,COMMA which is the largest slum in East Africa .PERIOD
Millions of people living here ,COMMA stretched over many kilometers .PERIOD
They're private schools .PERIOD There are no state schools in slums .PERIOD
It's not to do with electricity or water .PERIOD
If you want to design from scratch virtually any service in Africa ,COMMA you would start now with the mobile phone .PERIOD
This is a place called the Madangiri Settlement Colony ,COMMA which is a very developed slum about 25 minutes outside New Delhi ,COMMA where I met these characters who showed me around for the day .PERIOD
Ten years ago ,COMMA they certainly would have been married .PERIOD
This is the best you can get in Hyderabad in Indian education .PERIOD
But they find it completely obvious to use computers ,COMMA websites ,COMMA make videos ,COMMA so on and so forth .PERIOD
One is to deliver extrinsic motivation ,COMMA that education has a payoff .PERIOD
That's too long if you're poor .PERIOD
So you need education to be relevant and help people to make a living there and then ,COMMA often .PERIOD
Our education systems ,COMMA you do all that stuff afterward ,COMMA if you're lucky ,COMMA sport ,COMMA drama ,COMMA music .PERIOD
So El Sistema in Venezuela uses a violin as a technology of learning .PERIOD
Taio Rocha uses making soap as a technology of learning .PERIOD
And I learned it from this guy ,COMMA who is an amazing character .PERIOD
And it also supports working-class kids going into Indian schools .PERIOD
And it's the same wherever you go .PERIOD
It's reliable and people know exactly where they are .PERIOD
Why can't we do it more like the Chinese restaurants ?QUESTIONMARK
There are Big Picture schools in the US .PERIOD and Australia .PERIOD
But because so many of the issues in education aren't just in school ,COMMA they're in family and community ,COMMA what you also need ,COMMA definitely ,COMMA is more on the right hand side .PERIOD
You need efforts to supplement schools .PERIOD
That's an entire second adult lifetime that's been added to our lifespan .PERIOD
But many people today -- philosophers ,COMMA artists ,COMMA doctors ,COMMA scientists -- are taking a new look at what I call the third act ,COMMA the last three decades of life .PERIOD
They realize that this is actually a developmental stage of life with its own significance -- as different from midlife as adolescence is from childhood .PERIOD
I've spent the last year researching and writing about this subject .PERIOD
Obviously ,COMMA there's no guarantee that it can be a time of fruition and growth .PERIOD
It was about a man named Neil Selinger -- 57 years old ,COMMA a retired lawyer -- who had joined the writers group at Sarah Lawrence where he found his writer's voice .PERIOD

If however ,COMMA we can go back and alter our relationship ,COMMA re-vision our relationship to past people and events ,COMMA neural pathways can change .PERIOD
I mean ,COMMA as girls ,COMMA we start off feisty -- Yeah ,COMMA who says ?QUESTIONMARK
We have agency .PERIOD
But very often ,COMMA many ,COMMA if not most of us ,COMMA when we hit puberty ,COMMA we start worrying about fitting in and being popular .PERIOD
Thank you very much .PERIOD
But most species actually use insects to do their bidding ,COMMA and that's more intelligent in a way ,COMMA because the pollen ,COMMA they don't need so much of it .PERIOD
The insects and other species can take the pollen ,COMMA transfer it directly to where it's required .PERIOD
There are markings on many plants that look like other insects .PERIOD
These are the anthers of a lily ,COMMA cleverly done so that when the unsuspecting insect lands on it ,COMMA the anther flips up and whops it on the back with a great load of pollen that it then goes to another plant with .PERIOD
And basically what the insect has to do -- we're in the middle of the flower -- it has to stick its little proboscis right into the middle of that and all the way down that nectar tube to get to the nectar .PERIOD
So not only has the fly not got the nectar from the mimic plant ,COMMA it's also -- if you look very closely just at the head end ,COMMA you can see that it's got a bit of pollen that it would be transmitting to another plant ,COMMA if only some botanist hadn't come along and stuck it to a blue piece of card .PERIOD
And when the insect gets there and lands on it ,COMMA dousing itself in pollen ,COMMA of course ,COMMA that it's going to take to another plant ,COMMA if you look at the every-home-should-have-one scanning electron microscope picture ,COMMA you can see that there are actually some patterning there ,COMMA which is three-dimensional .PERIOD
Sometimes the whole plant mimics an insect ,COMMA even to us .PERIOD
So flies love this .PERIOD
They lay their eggs in it ,COMMA thinking it's a nice bit of carrion ,COMMA and not realizing that there's no food for the eggs ,COMMA that the eggs are going to die ,COMMA but the plant ,COMMA meanwhile ,COMMA has benefited ,COMMA because the bristles release and the flies disappear to pollinate the next flower -- fantastic .PERIOD
This thing does something else which is unusual .PERIOD
Recently ,COMMA a wise media theorist Tweeted ,COMMA The 19 th century culture was defined by the novel ,COMMA the 20 th century culture was defined by the cinema ,COMMA and the culture of the 21 st century will be defined by the interface .PERIOD
And I believe this is going to prove true .PERIOD
And that's us down there in LA .PERIOD and Long Beach on the bottom .PERIOD
This is Baron Wolfgang von Kempelen's mechanical chess playing machine .PERIOD

So we resynthesized this song .PERIOD
And then you'd do your best to recreate that with your own voice .PERIOD
After previewing it and confirming it's what you submitted ,COMMA you could submit it into the Mechanical Turk with no other context .PERIOD
I'm sorry for this .PERIOD
And this was seen by a director in LA .PERIOD named James Frost who said ,COMMA Wait a minute .PERIOD
And I think one of my favorite parts of this project was not just shooting a video with lasers ,COMMA but we also open sourced it ,COMMA and we made it released as a Google Code project ,COMMA where people could download a bunch of the data and some source code to build their own versions of it .PERIOD
So we thought this was the perfect project to build a collaborative memorial and a virtual resurrection for Johnny Cash .PERIOD
Collaborator Five :COLON As much as is different from frame to frame ,COMMA it really is personal .PERIOD
But there's a bunch of different styles .PERIOD
There is a real problem with snobbery .PERIOD

Snobbery is a global phenomenon .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA the opposite of a snob is your mother .PERIOD

We're told ,COMMA from many sources ,COMMA that anyone can achieve anything .PERIOD
We are now in a system where anyone can rise to any position they please .PERIOD
They own their success .PERIOD But they also own their failure .PERIOD
But I think it's insane to believe that we will ever make a society that is genuinely meritocratic .PERIOD It's an impossible dream .PERIOD
What we fear is the judgment and ridicule of others .PERIOD And it exists .PERIOD
And then are fit for ridicule .PERIOD
Now is there any alternative to this ?QUESTIONMARK
And that's why we enjoy looking at glaciers and oceans ,COMMA and contemplating the Earth from outside its perimeters ,COMMA etc .PERIOD
When banking is no longer so respectable ,COMMA we lose interest in banking .PERIOD
But what I really want to stress is by all means ,COMMA success ,COMMA yes .PERIOD
Because the emphasis nowadays is so much on the justice of everything ,COMMA and politicians always talk about justice .PERIOD
But it doesn't matter that much that we're putting too much emphasis on that ?QUESTIONMARK
Thank you very much .PERIOD

And when I said I'm going to go out and do a 15 -hour swim ,COMMA and we're coming into the dock after a long day and it's now night ,COMMA and we come in and it's 14 hours and 58 minutes and I can touch the dock and we're done ,COMMA the trainer says ,COMMA That's great .PERIOD
Try going in with an armada like we had of 50 people and five boats and CNN's crew ,COMMA etc .PERIOD

And I gathered together ,COMMA honestly ,COMMA the world's leading experts in every possible way .PERIOD
And a month ago ,COMMA the 23 rd of September ,COMMA I stood on that shore and I looked across to that long ,COMMA long faraway horizon and I asked myself ,COMMA do you have it ?QUESTIONMARK
You're really left alone with your own thoughts .PERIOD
First of all ,COMMA you're going to hit obstacles .PERIOD
And even though you're feeling great at any one moment ,COMMA don't take it for granted ,COMMA be ready ,COMMA because there's going to be pain ,COMMA there's going to be suffering .PERIOD

Henry ,COMMA what's your question ?QUESTIONMARK
And I said ,COMMA Well it's odd that you've learned of this as a noble kind of pursuit ,COMMA but yeah ,COMMA I know those guys .PERIOD
He said ,COMMA That's what you need .PERIOD
Thank you .PERIOD
This hope is still alive .PERIOD
Are you going to swim the Atlantic ?QUESTIONMARK
I said ,COMMA Nope .PERIOD I didn't know .PERIOD
And I left everything and went for a long series of odd jobs .PERIOD
They come in a lot of different shapes .PERIOD
So I'm always looking for the false cognates or identical words in different languages .PERIOD
So I did a series of work where it was identical words in French and in English .PERIOD
So if you don't know one of these languages ,COMMA it's instant learning .PERIOD
It's all if .PERIOD
And we can use them also as a safety net .PERIOD
People tell me their lives ,COMMA their memories ,COMMA their aspirations ,COMMA and I create a mindscape .PERIOD
I was also interested in the physicality of this format ,COMMA because you have to walk to see it .PERIOD
So it's like the different layers of what we are made of and what we present to the world as an identity .PERIOD
Why do I call it a book ?QUESTIONMARK
After eight years of rejection ,COMMA I was thrilled to get my first commission with the Percent for Art in New York City .PERIOD
Here it's faceted glass in the Bronx .PERIOD
Because if you sit a long time in summer in shorts ,COMMA you will walk away with temporary branding of the story element on your thighs .PERIOD
It's a story about transformation and connections .PERIOD
And here I've been working for the last three years with a South Bronx developer to bring art to life to low-income buildings and affordable housing .PERIOD
And I wanted to give them an escape .PERIOD
But the result is always to have stories .PERIOD
And you get to think about yourself and your memories ,COMMA and before you go back into suspension ,COMMA you edit your memories and you change your personality and so forth .PERIOD
But lots of people now live to 90 or 100 ,COMMA unless they shake hands too much or something like that .PERIOD
Which ,COMMA by chimpanzee standards ,COMMA is very good indeed .PERIOD
And I guess I better skip all the rest of this ,COMMA which are some details on how we might make those smart machines and -- -- and the main idea is in fact that the core of a really smart machine is one that recognizes that a certain kind of problem is facing you .PERIOD
Any guesses ?QUESTIONMARK 1816 .PERIOD

And then as we go further ,COMMA today we have continuous glucose sensors .PERIOD
I didn't have one of those ,COMMA but I got the Fitbit .PERIOD

There's also a tremendous number of techniques that chefs have developed ,COMMA some about new aesthetics ,COMMA new approaches to food .PERIOD
None of the techniques that these people have developed over the course of the last 20 years is in any of those books .PERIOD
Is there a way we can show people food in a way they have not seen it before ?QUESTIONMARK
Then each of the different little pieces around it explain some fact .PERIOD
Well ,COMMA that first cutaway picture worked ,COMMA so we said ,COMMA Okay ,COMMA let's do some more .PERIOD
Once you start cutting things in half ,COMMA you kind of get carried away ,COMMA so you see we cut the jars in half as well as the pan .PERIOD
And each of these text blocks explains a key thing that's going on .PERIOD
But to make them palatable ,COMMA we cut it out of a steel plate and put it in front of a fire and photographed it like this .PERIOD
Everybody knows that your various appliances have wattage ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK
As it comes out of the grinder ,COMMA you just have a little tray ,COMMA and you just take it off in little passes ,COMMA build it up ,COMMA slice it vertically .PERIOD
Now watch closely .PERIOD This is popcorn .PERIOD I'll explain it here .PERIOD
The popcorn is illustrating a key thing in physics .PERIOD
But surgeons in these eras are a little bit more conservative than their bold ,COMMA trephinating ancestors .PERIOD
And he is credited with doing over 4000 of these public surgeries ,COMMA wandering around in Europe ,COMMA which is an astonishing number ,COMMA when you think that surgery must have been a last resort .PERIOD
Joseph Lister was aepsis's ,COMMA or sterility's ,COMMA biggest advocate ,COMMA to a very very skeptical bunch of surgeons .PERIOD
The Mayo brothers came out to visit Lister in Europe .PERIOD
Something so simple .PERIOD
Laparoscopy is doing this kind of surgery :COLON surgery with long instruments through small incisions .PERIOD
But there were casualties of this revolution .PERIOD
They had to give up their wrists .PERIOD
They had to give up intuitive motion in the instruments .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA what you put between those instruments and those hands ,COMMA is a large ,COMMA fairly complicated robot .PERIOD
And since this was introduced in 1999 ,COMMA a lot of these robots have been out and being used for surgical procedures like a prostatectomy ,COMMA which is a prostate deep in the pelvis ,COMMA and it requires fine dissection and delicate manipulation to be able to get a good surgical outcome .PERIOD
More useful than a solid gold surgeon ,COMMA but ,COMMA still ,COMMA it's a fairly big capital investment .PERIOD
It has to be able to come off of the centerline and then be able to work back toward that centerline .PERIOD
It's not so simple .PERIOD
For the patient ,COMMA however ,COMMA it's transparent .PERIOD This is all they're going to see .PERIOD
It's very exciting to think where we get to go with this .PERIOD
As we take these capabilities ,COMMA and we get to go to the next places ,COMMA we get to decide what our new surgeries are going to be .PERIOD
And I think to really get the rest of the way in that revolution ,COMMA we need to not just take our hands in in new ways ,COMMA we also need to take our eyes in in new ways .PERIOD
We need to see beyond the surface .PERIOD
You know for me ,COMMA the interest in contemporary forms of slavery started with a leaflet that I picked up in London .PERIOD
And I'm going to admit to hubris .PERIOD
It was mind-blowing .PERIOD
But in fact that kind of bluey color are the countries where we can't find any cases of slavery .PERIOD
Well ,COMMA it builds up with these factors .PERIOD
Add in the increased vulnerability of very large numbers of people in the developing world ,COMMA caused by civil wars ,COMMA ethnic conflicts ,COMMA kleptocratic governments ,COMMA disease .PERIOD you name it ,COMMA you know it .PERIOD
But if corruption creeps in and people don't have the opportunity to have that protection of the rule of law ,COMMA then if you can use violence ,COMMA if you can use violence with impunity ,COMMA you can reach out and harvest the vulnerable into slavery .PERIOD
All around the world I've been told an almost identical story .PERIOD

Ten miles ,COMMA 100 miles ,COMMA 1000 miles later ,COMMA they find themselves in dirty ,COMMA dangerous ,COMMA demeaning work .PERIOD

Kevin Bales :COLON Okay ,COMMA you figured it out .PERIOD That's a spoof .PERIOD
Slaves cost between 3000 to 8000 dollars in North America ,COMMA but I could take you places in India or Nepal where human beings can be acquired for five or 10 dollars .PERIOD
They key here is that people have ceased to be that capital purchase item and become like Styrofoam cups .PERIOD
You buy them cheaply ,COMMA you use them ,COMMA you crumple them up ,COMMA and then when you're done with them you just throw them away .PERIOD
I've got to say ,COMMA one of the most exciting parts about my job is that I get to ,COMMA and I want to introduce you to one of those .PERIOD
This is not James ,COMMA this is one of the kids that he works with .PERIOD
And it can be done .PERIOD
Liberation ,COMMA and more importantly all the work that comes after liberation .PERIOD
This is what liberation really looks like .PERIOD
She said ,COMMA No ,COMMA because we've got hope now .PERIOD
Okay ,COMMA thank you so much .PERIOD
Despite the New York Times' and Vanity Fair's best efforts recently ,COMMA they're not brothers .PERIOD
This is actually a training film for a clown college that they had .PERIOD
There is a picture of Charles .PERIOD So let's watch the next clip .PERIOD
But people live on this land .PERIOD
So what we're going to see is some of the icons of Eames furniture .PERIOD
And I'm really here to talk about design .PERIOD
And this is a little film I made about the making of the Eames lounge chair .PERIOD
Because it just kind of ,COMMA you know ,COMMA doesn't get any more basic than that .PERIOD
This is a relatively famous chair .PERIOD
But doing these splints they learned a lot about the manufacturing process ,COMMA which was incredibly important to them .PERIOD
I'm trying to show you too much ,COMMA because I want you to really get a broth of ideas and images .PERIOD
This is a house that Charles and Ray designed .PERIOD
My sister is chasing someone else .PERIOD It's not me .PERIOD
Although I endorse heartily the fact that he stole her diary ,COMMA it's not me .PERIOD
The house is 1949 .PERIOD
And now I'm going to test you .PERIOD
I hope you had a nice time at Buddy's party .PERIOD
And they honor events in the linear world from the fictional world .PERIOD
And then Embassy Row is actually a historical site ,COMMA because in the Kymaerican story this is where the Parisian Diaspora started ,COMMA where there embassy was .PERIOD
And the town has really embraced it .PERIOD
And you're kind of trapped in the texture of Kymaerica .PERIOD
And this is Cranbrook .PERIOD I've got a real treat for you ,COMMA which is the first film that Charles ever made .PERIOD
And he made it for the 1939 faculty exhibition .PERIOD
You want to learn how to make films ?QUESTIONMARK Go make a movie .PERIOD
So my point is that this scope of vision ,COMMA this holistic vision of design ,COMMA was with them from the beginning .PERIOD
It wasn't like Oh ,COMMA we made some chairs and got successful .PERIOD
So we're going to do the last clip .PERIOD
And part of why this stuff is important and all the things that we do are important ,COMMA is that these are the ideas we need .PERIOD
And ,COMMA working on the idea that the cheapest electric toaster would also be the simplest to reverse-engineer ,COMMA I went and bought the cheapest toaster I could find ,COMMA took it home and was kind of dismayed to discover that ,COMMA inside this object ,COMMA which I'd bought for just 349 pounds ,COMMA there were 400 different bits made out of a hundred-plus different materials .PERIOD
Can I come up and get some iron ?QUESTIONMARK
But after some nagging ,COMMA I got him to do that .PERIOD
But instead of a bellows ,COMMA I had a leaf blower .PERIOD
Plastic is the defining feature of cheap electrical goods .PERIOD
And you can actually make plastic from obviously oils which come from plants ,COMMA but also from starches .PERIOD
So this is attempting to make potato starch plastic .PERIOD
And it was looking good for a while ,COMMA but I left it outside ,COMMA because you had to leave it outside to dry ,COMMA and unfortunately I came back and there were snails eating the unhydrolyzed bits of potato .PERIOD
So kind of out of desperation ,COMMA I decided that I could think laterally .PERIOD
And there it is on the shelves .PERIOD
I don't know if you could see ,COMMA but I was never able to make insulation for the wires .PERIOD
They were trying to catch fish .PERIOD
However ,COMMA the report focused on what had already occurred and offered no information on what to expect now .PERIOD
Voice 1 :COLON It's coming again .PERIOD Voice 2 :COLON New wave ?QUESTIONMARK
You know ,COMMA if you think about something like Google ,COMMA which essentially is relying on the collective intelligence of the Web to seek out those sites that have the most valuable information -- we know that Google does an exceptionally good job of doing that ,COMMA and it does that because ,COMMA collectively ,COMMA this disorganized thing we call the World Wide Web actually has a remarkable order ,COMMA or a remarkable intelligence in it .PERIOD
But what the blogosphere offers is the possibility of getting at the kind of collective ,COMMA distributive intelligence that is out there ,COMMA and that we know is available to us if we can just figure out a way of accessing it .PERIOD
A network is not just the product of its component parts .PERIOD
It is something more than that .PERIOD
And that phenomenon of piling on the existing links is one that is characteristic of the blogosphere ,COMMA particularly of the political blogosphere ,COMMA and it is one that essentially throws off this beautiful ,COMMA decentralized ,COMMA bottom-up intelligence that blogs can manifest in the right conditions .PERIOD
When we talk about bottom-up ,COMMA decentralized phenomena ,COMMA the ant colony is the classic metaphor ,COMMA because ,COMMA no individual ant knows what it's doing ,COMMA but collectively ants are able to reach incredibly intelligent decisions .PERIOD
But the pace of exponential growth is really what describes information technologies .PERIOD
It makes a huge difference .PERIOD
And Moore's Law was not the first paradigm to bring exponential growth to computing .PERIOD
When that comes to an end we'll go to the sixth paradigm ;SEMICOLON three-dimensional self-organizing molecular circuits .PERIOD
The Great Depression made not a dent in this exponential progression .PERIOD
And I was asked ,COMMA Well aren't you nervous ?QUESTIONMARK
And the cost of a transistor cycle ,COMMA which is a measure of the price performance of electronics ,COMMA comes down about every year .PERIOD
But that was really right on schedule .PERIOD
Communication technologies :COLON 50 different ways to measure this ,COMMA the number of bits being moved around ,COMMA the size of the Internet .PERIOD
Some critics say ,COMMA Oh ,COMMA well software is stuck in the mud .PERIOD
When I was a student it was across campus ,COMMA now it's in our pockets .PERIOD
All the intellectual property that is created and taught will be online and available ,COMMA and developed online in a collaborative fashion .PERIOD

A couple of weeks ago we took it down to Walter Reed ,COMMA which is unfortunately more in the news these days .PERIOD
It's going to go inside something that we use in CAT scans and MRIs of whatever is their good arm ,COMMA to make silicon rubber ,COMMA then coat it ,COMMA and paint it in 3 D -- exact mirror image of their other limb .PERIOD
This weighs 69 pounds .PERIOD
Now he's going to pick up a pen with his opposed thumb and index finger .PERIOD
That's about 10 percent of our global needs and 100 percent of some island nations .PERIOD
It all began when two scientists ,COMMA Fred Grassle and Jesse Ausubel ,COMMA met in Woods Hole ,COMMA Massachusetts where both were guests at the famed oceanographic institute .PERIOD
They ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA are an endangered species themselves .PERIOD
So fishermen could only catch what they could either eat or sell that day .PERIOD
But this is no laughing matter .PERIOD
That's the sort of technology that's available today that really wasn't available even a decade ago .PERIOD
And so for animals that come to the surface to breathe ,COMMA such as this elephant seal ,COMMA it's an opportunity to send data back to shore and tell us where exactly it is in the ocean .PERIOD
For example ,COMMA the dark blue shows you where the elephant seal moved in the north Pacific .PERIOD
For animals that don't surface ,COMMA we have something called pop-up tags ,COMMA which collect data about light and what time the sun rises and sets .PERIOD
Geneticists have developed a similar tool called genetic barcoding .PERIOD
And so they put this together ,COMMA a list of all the species ,COMMA where they're known to occur ,COMMA and it really seemed like a very esoteric ,COMMA scientific type of exercise .PERIOD
So all of a sudden ,COMMA this labor of love for no obvious economic reason has become a critical piece of information in terms of how that system is going to recover ,COMMA how long it will take and how the lawsuits and the multi-billion-dollar discussions that are going to happen in the coming years are likely to be resolved .PERIOD
You can do this on a global scale ,COMMA but you can also do it on a regional scale .PERIOD
Now while a lot of the species we discovered in the census are things that are small and hard to see ,COMMA that certainly wasn't always the case .PERIOD
Similarly this Golden V kelp collected in Alaska just below the low water mark is probably a new species .PERIOD
This particular shrimp ,COMMA we've dubbed it the Jurassic shrimp ,COMMA it's thought to have gone extinct 50 years ago -- at least it was ,COMMA until the census discovered it was living and doing just fine off the coast of Australia .PERIOD
Now this little critter ,COMMA it's only about half a millimeter in size ,COMMA not terribly charismatic .PERIOD
And we also found this spectacular yeti crab that lives near boiling hot hydrothermal vents at Easter Island .PERIOD
That means 91 percent ,COMMA even after the census ,COMMA still remain to be discovered .PERIOD
But the really intriguing thing about the microbes is just how diverse they are .PERIOD
A single drop of seawater could contain 160 different types of microbes .PERIOD
The other point I'd like to make about this is that this ocean's interconnected .PERIOD
Census scientists worked in the rain ,COMMA they worked in the cold ,COMMA they worked under water and they worked above water trying to illuminate the wondrous discovery ,COMMA the still vast unknown ,COMMA the spectacular adaptations that we see in ocean life .PERIOD
So whether you're a yak herder living in the mountains of Chile ,COMMA whether you're a stockbroker in New York City or whether you're a TEDster living in Edinburgh ,COMMA the oceans matter .PERIOD

Well ,COMMA it's been around for 2500 years .PERIOD
And we do something different than what we did in the past ;SEMICOLON we add kind of a modicum of intelligence to that .PERIOD
If there are 15 operations ,COMMA you know that none of them work .PERIOD
You've heard that word several times in the last four days ,COMMA and everyone's familiar with Kuhnian paradigms .PERIOD
And by the human spirit ,COMMA I don't mean anything divine ,COMMA I don't mean anything supernatural -- certainly not coming from this skeptic .PERIOD
What I mean is this ability that each of us has to be something greater than herself or himself ;SEMICOLON to arise out of our ordinary selves and achieve something that at the beginning we thought perhaps we were not capable of .PERIOD
There has certainly been no argument about that in this room in the past four days .PERIOD
So ,COMMA if we are to be the world's healer ,COMMA every disadvantaged person in this world -- including in the United States -- becomes our patient .PERIOD
I would like to quote one of my own household gods .PERIOD

So the old days before digital radio when you were tuning in your radio and you heard crrcckkk on the station you wanted to hear ,COMMA that was the noise .PERIOD
So if you're lucky enough to be able to knock a small white ball into a hole several hundred yards away using a long metal stick ,COMMA our society will be willing to reward you with hundreds of millions of dollars .PERIOD
But we're going to represent beliefs with probabilities .PERIOD
But there's another source of information ,COMMA and that's effectively prior knowledge .PERIOD
But you know that your senses are not perfect ,COMMA and therefore there's some variability of where it's going to land shown by that cloud of red ,COMMA representing numbers between 05 and maybe 01 .PERIOD
That information is available in the current shot ,COMMA but there's another source of information not available on the current shot ,COMMA but only available by repeated experience in the game of tennis ,COMMA and that's that the ball doesn't bounce with equal probability over the court during the match .PERIOD
As we go around ,COMMA we learn about statistics of the world and lay that down ,COMMA but we also learn about how noisy our own sensory apparatus is ,COMMA and then combine those in a real Bayesian way .PERIOD
So that really means I have to make predictions of the future .PERIOD
Any discrepancy should hopefully be external .PERIOD
So as I go around the world ,COMMA I'm making predictions of what I should get ,COMMA subtracting them off .PERIOD
And we replay that to the other hand with a time delay .PERIOD
And based on this illustration ,COMMA we really convinced ourselves in the field that the brain's making precise predictions and subtracting them off from the sensations .PERIOD
So we were looking for a much more objective way to assess this phenomena .PERIOD
So if they retaliate with the same force ,COMMA the first person will think it's been escalated .PERIOD
Now we don't work with children ,COMMA we don't work with hitting ,COMMA but the concept is identical .PERIOD
We started with a motor with a little lever ,COMMA a little force transfuser .PERIOD
So it re-shows the brain makes predictions and fundamentally changes the precepts .PERIOD
But we've got a problem .PERIOD
And there's a big gap between the task and the movement system .PERIOD
I could choose these two paths out of an infinite number of paths .PERIOD
Maybe we don't all quite move the same way .PERIOD
But there's noise added to this .PERIOD
So if I pick the same command through many times ,COMMA I will get a different noisy version each time ,COMMA because noise changes each time .PERIOD
And the fundamental idea is you want to plan your movements so as to minimize the negative consequence of the noise .PERIOD
So you want to avoid big forces as one principle .PERIOD
So we've shown that using this ,COMMA we can explain a huge amount of data -- that exactly people are going about their lives planning movements so as to minimize negative consequences of noise .PERIOD
All the conversation stopped .PERIOD All the eyes turned to me .PERIOD
And so ,COMMA what I'd like to do now is to tell you about what we've learned in those journeys .PERIOD
They put smart skylights through their stores so they could harvest the daylight and reduce the lighting demands .PERIOD
So ,COMMA let me tell you this :COLON when Wal-Mart achieves 20 percent energy reductions ,COMMA that's going to be a very big deal .PERIOD But I'm afraid it's not enough .PERIOD
Well ,COMMA Bob said the most important thing we could do right now is to make it clear in Sacramento ,COMMA California that we need a market-based system of mandates that's going to cap and reduce greenhouse gases in California .PERIOD
Here's a story about national policy that we could all learn from .PERIOD
They'd run ethanol or ordinary gasoline .PERIOD
So ,COMMA what's happened in Brazil is ,COMMA they've replaced 40 percent of the gasoline consumed by their automotive fleet with ethanol .PERIOD
So ,COMMA a team of Berkeley researchers with 15 million dollars from the Gates Foundation is engineering ,COMMA designing a radical new way to make the key ingredient ,COMMA called artemisinin ,COMMA and they're going to make that drug 10 times cheaper .PERIOD
Well ,COMMA I'll tell you -- a lot .PERIOD
Second fact :COLON the President's new budget for renewable energy is barely a billion dollars in total .PERIOD
Third fact :COLON I bet you didn't know that there's enough energy in hot rocks under the country to supply America's energy needs for the next thousand years .PERIOD And the federal budget calls for a measly 20 million dollars of R&ampD in geothermal energy .PERIOD
Not enough to stabilize the climate .PERIOD
Not enough to keep the ice in Greenland from crashing into the ocean .PERIOD
We've got to make this economic so that all people and all nations make the right outcome ,COMMA the profitable outcome ,COMMA and therefore the likely outcome .PERIOD
It is the mother of all markets .PERIOD You remember that Internet ?QUESTIONMARK
She's like ,COMMA Oh ,COMMA us .PERIOD I'm like ,COMMA Okay .PERIOD All right .PERIOD That's cool .PERIOD
And there's a dude selling these aftermarket weapons for Lego ,COMMA because Lego -- the Danish -- no ,COMMA they're not into guns .PERIOD
But the Americans ?QUESTIONMARK Oh ,COMMA we'll make some guns for Lego ,COMMA no problem .PERIOD
And at a certain point ,COMMA you look around ,COMMA you're like ,COMMA Whoa ,COMMA this is a really nerdy crowd .PERIOD
I'm kind of into this stuff ,COMMA and I'm going to stop being embarrassed .PERIOD
And so this is like this CAD program where you build it .PERIOD
I have to take a moment .PERIOD
There's a whole gray market for Lego ,COMMA thousands of home-based businesses .PERIOD
Let's see here .PERIOD
That's 300 million years per minute .PERIOD
So ,COMMA this is frozen water .PERIOD
The most intriguing and puzzling measurement ,COMMA in my opinion ,COMMA we've obtained of Mars ,COMMA was released earlier this year in the magazine Science .PERIOD
And what we're looking at is the presence of the gas methane ,COMMA CH 4 ,COMMA in the atmosphere of Mars .PERIOD
That's because the northern hemisphere is the region of the ancient ocean basin .PERIOD
And that's because the water protected the basin from being impacted by asteroids and meteorites .PERIOD
Here's Hellas Basin ,COMMA a very very different place ,COMMA geologically .PERIOD
We addressed on the board the major questions that have not been answered .PERIOD
And the result of our meeting was a robotic rocket-powered airplane we call ARES .PERIOD
And our goal is to inspire the American public who is paying for this mission through tax dollars .PERIOD
How do we transport an airplane to Mars ?QUESTIONMARK
And we have it in something called an aeroshell .PERIOD
Because we have tested ARES model ,COMMA several models in a half a dozen wind tunnels at the NASA Langley Research Center for eight years ,COMMA under Mars conditions .PERIOD
We're ready to go .PERIOD
This is the ARES team ;SEMICOLON we have about 150 scientists ,COMMA engineers ;SEMICOLON where we're working with Jet Propulsion Laboratory ,COMMA Goddard Space Flight Center ,COMMA Ames Research Center and half a dozen major universities and corporations in developing this .PERIOD
Thank you very much .PERIOD
And my colleague ,COMMA James Fowler and I have been studying for quite sometime what are the mathematical ,COMMA social ,COMMA biological and psychological rules that govern how these networks are assembled and what are the similar rules that govern how they operate ,COMMA how they affect our lives .PERIOD
They actually diffuse through networks .PERIOD
You could have friendship relationships ,COMMA sibling relationships ,COMMA spousal relationships ,COMMA co-worker relationships ,COMMA neighbor relationships and the like .PERIOD
Or their altruistic or their charitable giving behavior might be influenced by their coworkers ,COMMA or by their neighbors .PERIOD
Nicholas Christakis :COLON B ,COMMA it's obvious .PERIOD
And what we show here is -- like ,COMMA here -- very few people are affected ,COMMA more and more and more and up to here ,COMMA and here's the peak of the epidemic .PERIOD
And if they nominate the party host as their friend ,COMMA that party host has a hundred friends ,COMMA therefore ,COMMA has more friends than they do .PERIOD
So ,COMMA we thought we would exploit this idea in order to study whether we could predict phenomena within networks .PERIOD
And also ,COMMA we had them [actively] email us a couple of times a week .PERIOD
By monitoring the friends group ,COMMA we could get 16 days advance warning of an impending epidemic in this human population .PERIOD
Now in our case ,COMMA although it wasn't necessary ,COMMA we could also actually map the network of the students .PERIOD
We're going to take daily cuts through the network for 120 days .PERIOD
Every dot is a person ,COMMA and every line represents a volume of calls between the people .PERIOD
And in fact ,COMMA we are in the era of what I would call massive-passive data collection efforts .PERIOD
They're all kinds of ways we can use massively collected data to create sensor networks to follow the population ,COMMA understand what's happening in the population ,COMMA and intervene in the population for the better .PERIOD
One is quasi-active ,COMMA like the flu example I gave ,COMMA where we get some people to nominate their friends and then passively monitor their friends -- do they have the flu ,COMMA or not ?QUESTIONMARK -- and then get warning .PERIOD
They collect millions of points at a time with very high accuracy and very high resolution .PERIOD
They were gone in an instant .PERIOD
The Royal Tombs had been destroyed by suspected arson .PERIOD
Let me leave you with a final thought .PERIOD
And that was that an American congresswoman named Patricia Schroeder from Colorado met with a group of journalists .PERIOD
It will refer you directly to your congressperson ,COMMA to your US .PERIOD senator ,COMMA to your governor where divestment legislation is pending .PERIOD
For instance ,COMMA the referral of the crimes in Darfur to the International Criminal Court ,COMMA which the Bush administration doesn't like .PERIOD
He moved with the headlines .PERIOD
But ,COMMA uh-oh ,COMMA the killers are within the camps .PERIOD
Well ,COMMA if you denounce ,COMMA you're probably never going to get back in the room .PERIOD
You're un-owned .PERIOD
He started as somebody who would denounce harmdoers ,COMMA he would charge up to people who were violating international law ,COMMA and he would say ,COMMA you're violating ,COMMA this is the UN .PERIOD Charter .PERIOD
All the great progress in this country with relation to our adversaries has come by going into the room .PERIOD
There's going to be a lot of people .PERIOD
But it never struck me as it did that moment ,COMMA because on that image was a woman trying to nurse her baby ,COMMA and she had no milk to nurse .PERIOD
A hundred years ago ,COMMA we didn't .PERIOD
At our time in history ,COMMA these images are out of place .PERIOD
This is more than HIV/AIDS ,COMMA malaria and tuberculosis combined .PERIOD
And here you see a brain scan of two children -- one who had adequate nutrition ,COMMA another ,COMMA neglected and who was deeply malnourished .PERIOD
And so today we focus on not just passing out food ,COMMA but making sure the mothers have enough enrichment ,COMMA and teaching them about breastfeeding .PERIOD
It doesn't need to be refrigerated ,COMMA it doesn't need water ,COMMA which is often lacking .PERIOD
Eighty percent of the people in the world have no food safety net .PERIOD
And usually the institutions -- churches ,COMMA temples ,COMMA other things -- do not have the resources to provide a safety net .PERIOD
And if you fill the cup with local agriculture from small farmers ,COMMA you have a transformative effect .PERIOD
Many kids in the world can't go to school because they have to go beg and find a meal .PERIOD
It costs less than 25 cents a day to change a kid's life .PERIOD
Families need the help .PERIOD
So is this a hopeless cause ?QUESTIONMARK
Cameroon ,COMMA northern Cameroon ,COMMA boom and bust cycles of hunger every year for decades .PERIOD
Food aid coming in every year when people are starving during the lean seasons .PERIOD
You manage ,COMMA the village manages these warehouses .PERIOD
And the food banks are growing .PERIOD
We're seeing that now in the Horn of Africa where food prices are up 240 percent in some areas over last year .PERIOD
The shopkeepers are hiring more people .PERIOD
And they require that a third of that food come from the smallest farmers who would have no opportunity .PERIOD
I've gone out there ;SEMICOLON I've met with the small farmers who have built their livelihoods on the opportunity and platform provided by this .PERIOD
You look at the cost-benefit analysis ,COMMA and my dream is to take this issue ,COMMA not just from the compassion argument ,COMMA but to the finance ministers of the world ,COMMA and say we cannot afford to not invest in the access to adequate ,COMMA affordable nutrition for all of humanity .PERIOD
When a leader says ,COMMA Not under my watch ,COMMA everything begins to change .PERIOD
WFP's been able to leave 30 nations because they have transformed the face of hunger in their nations .PERIOD
Not only that ,COMMA transforming hunger is an opportunity ,COMMA but I think we have to change our mindsets .PERIOD
What's exciting is that over the last two or three years ,COMMA the government has spent 400 million dollars ,COMMA and they've allocated another billion dollars ,COMMA to what we call the Cancer Genome Atlas Project .PERIOD
The Cancer Genome Atlas is coming out now .PERIOD
There's also a field of proteomics that I'll talk about in a few minutes ,COMMA which I think is going to be the next level in terms of understanding and classifying disease .PERIOD
Cancer is an interaction of a cell that no longer is under growth control with the environment .PERIOD
The goal of me as a cancer doctor is not to understand cancer .PERIOD
You know ,COMMA if I measured your temperature over 30 days ,COMMA and I asked ,COMMA What was the average temperature ?QUESTIONMARK
I mean ,COMMA this is a scary slide ,COMMA not to take an aside ,COMMA but it looks at obesity in the world .PERIOD
So ,COMMA our systems today are dramatically different than our systems a decade or two ago .PERIOD
That is the most effective ,COMMA cost-effective ,COMMA best way we can do things today .PERIOD
Sounds are affecting your hormone secretions all the time ,COMMA but also your breathing ,COMMA your heart rate -- which I just also did -- and your brainwaves .PERIOD
It has the frequency of roughly 12 cycles per minute .PERIOD
There are eight expressions of a brand in sound .PERIOD
You all recognize that one .PERIOD This is the most-played tune in the world today .PERIOD
Why are we doing this ?QUESTIONMARK
The first is ,COMMA it's essential for us to understand the human brain if we do want to get along in society ,COMMA and I think that it is a key step in evolution .PERIOD
And you may think that anesthetics work by sending you into some deep sleep ,COMMA or by blocking your receptors so that you don't feel pain ,COMMA but in fact most anesthetics don't work that way .PERIOD
99 percent of what you see is not what comes in through the eyes .PERIOD
They are highly reactive ,COMMA and they are super-plastic ,COMMA and so the autists are probably capable of building and learning a symphony which is unthinkable for us .PERIOD
They choose very carefully who they connect with .PERIOD
And we did that for tens of thousands of neurons ,COMMA built digital models of all the different types of neurons we came across .PERIOD
And we think this is species-specific ,COMMA which means that that could explain why we can't communicate across species .PERIOD
So ,COMMA let's switch it on .PERIOD But to do it ,COMMA what you have to do is you have to make this come alive .PERIOD
There literally are only a handful of equations that you need to simulate the activity of the neocortex .PERIOD
Here we activate it .PERIOD And this gives the first glimpse of what is happening in your brain when there is a stimulation .PERIOD
We can ask ,COMMA Where is it inside ,COMMA if we stimulate it with a picture ?QUESTIONMARK
Fifty years ago ,COMMA when I began exploring the ocean ,COMMA no one -- not Jacques Perrin ,COMMA not Jacques Cousteau or Rachel Carson -- imagined that we could do anything to harm the ocean by what we put into it or by what we took out of it .PERIOD
I want to share with you my personal view of changes in the sea that affect all of us ,COMMA and to consider why it matters that in 50 years ,COMMA we've lost -- actually ,COMMA we've taken ,COMMA we've eaten -- more than 90 percent of the big fish in the sea ;SEMICOLON why you should care that nearly half of the coral reefs have disappeared ;SEMICOLON why a mysterious depletion of oxygen in large areas of the Pacific should concern not only the creatures that are dying ,COMMA but it really should concern you .PERIOD
I'm haunted by the thought of what Ray Anderson calls tomorrow's child ,COMMA asking why we didn't do something on our watch to save sharks and bluefin tuna and squids and coral reefs and the living ocean while there still was time .PERIOD
For me ,COMMA as a scientist ,COMMA it all began in 1953 when I first tried scuba .PERIOD
Since then ,COMMA I've used about 30 kinds of submarines and I've started three companies and a nonprofit foundation called Deep Search to design and build systems to access the deep sea .PERIOD
And I'm living proof .PERIOD
No matter where on Earth you live .PERIOD
Over time ,COMMA most of the planet's organic carbon has been absorbed and stored there ,COMMA mostly by microbes .PERIOD
You did a great job with the land ,COMMA the dirt .PERIOD
We need new deep-diving submarines .PERIOD
That's bad news for us too .PERIOD
We're putting hundreds of millions of tons of plastic and other trash into the sea .PERIOD
Millions of tons of discarded fishing nets ,COMMA gear that continues to kill .PERIOD
We're still killing bluefin tuna ;SEMICOLON truly endangered and much more valuable alive than dead .PERIOD
Using Google Earth you can witness trawlers -- in China ,COMMA the North Sea ,COMMA the Gulf of Mexico -- shaking the foundation of our life support system ,COMMA leaving plumes of death in their path .PERIOD
Together we had just broken the world speed record for a trek to the South Pole .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA many of you are probably saying ,COMMA Wait a sec ,COMMA is this tough to do ?QUESTIONMARK
You'll be in a massive headwind .PERIOD

Look at that central building right in the middle of the picture :COLON that's the 130 -foot diameter library ,COMMA that is exactly the size of the base of the spaceship .PERIOD
Two days later ,COMMA the space traveler's manifesto explaining why -- just like we heard yesterday -- why we need to go into space :COLON trips to satellites of the outer planets .PERIOD August 20 ,COMMA 1958 .PERIOD
And that's why when you get something declassified ,COMMA that's what it looks like .PERIOD
This is Ed Day putting .PERIOD So each of these coffee cans has three pounds of C 4 in it .PERIOD
So ,COMMA thanks to him .PERIOD
And now we have ground hazard assessments when you have a blow-up on the pad .PERIOD
This is the kind of stuff that's not been declassified ,COMMA just that people managed to sneak home and after ,COMMA you know ,COMMA on their deathbed basically gave me .PERIOD
And one part of NASA was interested in it but the headquarters in NASA ,COMMA they killed the project .PERIOD
So finally at the end ,COMMA we can see the thing followed its sort of design path right up to 1965 and then all those paths came to a halt .PERIOD
And it turned out to be quite fun in two ways .PERIOD
And to the extent you believe I didn't shrink the lines ,COMMA which I didn't ,COMMA I've proven to you that your eyes were deceiving you .PERIOD
Right ?QUESTIONMARK It's impossible to overcome this sense that this is indeed longer .PERIOD
Turns out that they got to 28 percent after mailing every household in the country a letter begging people to join this organ donation program .PERIOD
When you walk into the DMV ,COMMA the person who designed the form will have a huge influence on what you'll end up doing .PERIOD
What do you do ?QUESTIONMARK Do you pull the patient back and try ibuprofen ?QUESTIONMARK
The other group of the physicians ,COMMA they said ,COMMA Yesterday when you reviewed the case you discovered there were two medications you didn't try out yet ,COMMA ibuprofen and piroxicam .PERIOD
Now think of it .PERIOD This decision makes it as easy to let the patient continue with hip replacement .PERIOD
The thing is is that no physician would ever say ,COMMA Piroxicam ,COMMA ibuprofen ,COMMA hip replacement .PERIOD
An online subscription for 59 dollars .PERIOD
These are the market share .PERIOD Most people wanted the combo deal .PERIOD
The answer was absolutely yes .PERIOD
Now you're getting it .PERIOD
And we also have more than five billion of these devices here .PERIOD
These 14 million cellular radio masts ,COMMA or base stations ,COMMA consume a lot of energy .PERIOD
And that creates a big problem .PERIOD
it's good for a nice suntan ,COMMA but otherwise dangerous for the human body .PERIOD
And multiply that by 10000 ,COMMA then you end up at 14 billion .PERIOD
Not usable for a YouTube video .PERIOD
And the light goes through that hole .PERIOD
And that signal is then converted back to a high-speed data stream .PERIOD
And not only integrate a photo detector here ,COMMA but maybe use the camera inside .PERIOD
So what happens when I switch on that light ?QUESTIONMARK
But at the same time ,COMMA you see this video coming up here .PERIOD
So no one ,COMMA if I have a light here ,COMMA if I have secure data ,COMMA no one on the other side of this room through that wall would be able to read that data .PERIOD
So for me ,COMMA the applications of it ,COMMA to me ,COMMA are beyond imagination at the moment .PERIOD
And they use light to illuminate space down there .PERIOD
If you saw 2001 :COLON A Space Odyssey ,COMMA and you heard the boom ,COMMA boom ,COMMA boom ,COMMA boom ,COMMA and you saw the monolith ,COMMA you know ,COMMA that was Arthur C .PERIOD Clarke's representation that we were at a seminal moment in the evolution of our species .PERIOD
And ,COMMA you know ,COMMA we in the last 30 years in particular have seen this acceleration in knowledge and technology ,COMMA and technology has bred more knowledge and given us tools .PERIOD
And we've seen many seminal moments .PERIOD
You're walking around ;SEMICOLON your car has 12 microprocessors .PERIOD
Then we go along and create the Internet and connect the world together ;SEMICOLON we flatten the world .PERIOD
The DNA is organized in words ,COMMA call them :COLON genes and chromosomes .PERIOD
DNA is a very elegant molecule .PERIOD
This here is a bug in my genome that I have struggled with for a long ,COMMA long time .PERIOD
What is the code ?QUESTIONMARK
then you can go about the process of trying to fix it and figure it out .PERIOD
For my wife :COLON eat three times as much and you never put on any weight .PERIOD
It's all hidden in this code ,COMMA and it's starting to be understood at breakneck pace .PERIOD
We can understand ,COMMA for example ,COMMA why we create plaque in our arteries ,COMMA what creates the starchiness inside of a grain ,COMMA why does yeast metabolize sugar and produce carbon dioxide .PERIOD
We can also look at ,COMMA at a grander scale ,COMMA what creates problems ,COMMA what creates disease ,COMMA and how we may be able to fix them .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA you have the genome and you say to yourself ,COMMA So ,COMMA if I plug this synthetic genome -- if I pull the old one out and plug it in -- does it just boot up and live ?QUESTIONMARK
And this is extremely profound .PERIOD
So ,COMMA then what do you do ?QUESTIONMARK
We can start to figure that out .PERIOD
And he had the best answer I ever heard to this question :COLON Well ,COMMA somebody has to .PERIOD
You cannot compete with the environment ,COMMA if you have an adolescent dog's brain .PERIOD

He'll find Jamie wherever he is ,COMMA you know ,COMMA wherever kids are ,COMMA crushing rocks by a stream or something ,COMMA and take him a little message that says ,COMMA Hey ,COMMA dinner's ready .PERIOD Come in for dinner .PERIOD
So ,COMMA at this point ,COMMA the dog knows what we want it to do .PERIOD
The dog lives with you ,COMMA the dog can get you any time .PERIOD
So the second stage in training is to teach the dog to want to do what we want him to do ,COMMA and this is very easy .PERIOD
And what we're doing ,COMMA in essence ,COMMA is we're teaching the dog ,COMMA kind of like -- we're letting the dog think that the dog is training us .PERIOD
And now the dog's really happy .PERIOD
There's several definitions of what a punishment is ,COMMA but one definition ,COMMA the most popular ,COMMA is :COLON a punishment is a stimulus that reduces the immediately preceding behavior ,COMMA such that it's less likely to occur in the future .PERIOD
The dog is actually euthanized now ,COMMA but this was a dog I worked with for a while .PERIOD
When the dog would try to leave the mat ,COMMA she would say ,COMMA Rover ,COMMA on the mat ,COMMA on the mat ,COMMA on the mat .PERIOD
How are you going to reprimand a grizzly bear ?QUESTIONMARK
Rover ,COMMA come here .PERIOD Rover ,COMMA come here ,COMMA you son of a bitch .PERIOD
And I went ,COMMA Oh my God ,COMMA do I do something ?QUESTIONMARK
The husband won't clear up his clothes ,COMMA or the wife's always late for meetings ,COMMA whatever it is ,COMMA OK ?QUESTIONMARK
You see it especially in the workplace ,COMMA especially from boss to employee .PERIOD
And this ,COMMA I would say ,COMMA is the biggest human foible that we have .PERIOD
Your kids are easy to train .PERIOD
We think how we do it -- one night in bed ,COMMA we're pregnant ,COMMA and then we're raising the most important thing in life ,COMMA a child .PERIOD
And it concludes in something that you see here ,COMMA that you actually wouldn't expect as being the result of rationality .PERIOD
I call it sort of shotgun flexibility .PERIOD
So what you're seeing now is actually the design of the building .PERIOD
So that was the core idea .PERIOD
So ,COMMA once we had presented that back to them ,COMMA they agreed that this sort of core concept could work .PERIOD
The things on the -- on the left-hand side of the diagram ,COMMA those are the boxes .PERIOD
That skin serves double duty ,COMMA again for economics .PERIOD
So it's an unusual building for a public library ,COMMA obviously .PERIOD
That was the main sort of technology area in the building .PERIOD
You dizzy yet ?QUESTIONMARK
And it allowed us to go back to first principles ,COMMA and redefine fly tower ,COMMA acoustic enclosure ,COMMA light enclosure and so forth .PERIOD
They came to us and they said -- unlike normal developers -- they said ,COMMA We want to start out by providing a contemporary art museum in Louisville .PERIOD That's our main goal .PERIOD
And so instead of being a developer that sees an opportunity to make money ,COMMA they saw an ability to be a catalyst in their downtown .PERIOD
And that pro forma led us to a mixed-use building that was very large in order to support their aspirations of the art ,COMMA but it also opened up opportunities for the art itself to collaborate ,COMMA interact with commercial spaces that actually artists more and more want to work within .PERIOD
And there is a pedestrian corridor that they wanted to add that would link a series of cultural buildings ,COMMA and a view corridor -- because this is the historic district -- that they didn't want to obstruct with the new building .PERIOD
It also means that if an artist wants to invade something like a swimming pool ,COMMA they can begin to do their exhibition in a swimming pool ,COMMA so they're not forced to always work within the confines of a contemporary gallery space .PERIOD
OK .PERIOD Now ,COMMA you're 19 now ?QUESTIONMARK
And I tried ,COMMA and I made it .PERIOD
And you made it out of what ?QUESTIONMARK
And so ,COMMA and that windmill ,COMMA what -- it worked ?QUESTIONMARK
Yeah .PERIOD
So what did they make of -- that you were 14 ,COMMA 15 at the time -- what did they make of this ?QUESTIONMARK They were impressed ?QUESTIONMARK

The oil was running out ,COMMA and a nuclear winter would finish us off .PERIOD
It just tells you they were both designed to fit the human hand .PERIOD
Homo erectus made the same tool for 30000 generations .PERIOD
Of course there were a few changes ,COMMA but tools changed slower than skeletons in those days .PERIOD

So Oz is better at both spears and axes than Adam .PERIOD
Ask yourself how long you would have to work to provide for yourself an hour of reading light this evening to read a book by .PERIOD
And that's seven and a half seconds of prosperity that you've gained since 1950 ,COMMA as it were ,COMMA because that's seven and a half seconds in which you can do something else ,COMMA or you can acquire another good or service .PERIOD

My belief is that you don't have to make yourself bad to look at these issues .PERIOD
How can we investigate this flora of viruses that surround us ,COMMA and aid medicine ?QUESTIONMARK
But evolution is a balance :COLON where you have fast change ,COMMA you also have ultra-conservation -- things that almost never change .PERIOD
And so we looked into this a little more carefully ,COMMA and I'm going to show you data now .PERIOD
Down here you can see slower evolution :COLON less diversity .PERIOD
OK ,COMMA so that's what we did ,COMMA but how are we going to do that ?QUESTIONMARK
If you've got enough money to buy just a Camry ,COMMA you can build one of these too ,COMMA and so we put a deep how-to guide on the Web ,COMMA totally free ,COMMA with basically order-off-the-shelf parts .PERIOD
And so what we did -- and this is a really cool project -- we just started by making a respiratory virus chip .PERIOD
That's the scourge of daycare centers everywhere -- it's like boogeremia ,COMMA basically .PERIOD
And so it is not any one stripe or something that tells me I have a virus of a particular type here ;SEMICOLON it's the barcode that in bulk represents the whole thing .PERIOD
That's me ,COMMA getting a nasal lavage .PERIOD
Actually ,COMMA we thought the nasal tract might be full of viruses even when you're walking around healthy .PERIOD
So that's great ,COMMA but again ,COMMA cheap shot ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK
So ,COMMA we built out the chip .PERIOD
Now we're using this chip .PERIOD And what are we using it for ?QUESTIONMARK
And this is what this looks like .PERIOD
And that is ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA what these particular cell cultures are chronically infected with .PERIOD
So let's do something a little bit harder .PERIOD
They did a CT scan .PERIOD
Switch antibiotics :COLON so they switched to another antibiotic ,COMMA Tamiflu .PERIOD
There's almost no epidemiology or studies on it .PERIOD
And why is that ?QUESTIONMARK Just lore .PERIOD There's no data -- no data to support whether it causes severe or mild disease .PERIOD
It doesn't make sense -- unless ,COMMA maybe ,COMMA there's a virus ?QUESTIONMARK
And this is a little phylogenetic tree to see how it's related to other viruses .PERIOD
Is it the case that these guys are just more susceptible to viruses ?QUESTIONMARK
This was all done by folks in the lab -- I cannot take credit for most of this .PERIOD
I'm talking about the production of aluminum .PERIOD

I felt the thrill of realization when I knew I'd come upon the answer .PERIOD
It's pretty cool ,COMMA at least in theory .PERIOD
We go to the laboratory .PERIOD

And since they discovered those things ,COMMA it really stuck with them so much more ,COMMA and also they would experience their own failures ;SEMICOLON there was a failure-based aspect to learning there .PERIOD It was very important .PERIOD
And another thing that really impressed me a long time ago was Powers of Ten ,COMMA Charles and Ray Eames' film .PERIOD
And so I'm going to show you a toy today that I've been working on ,COMMA that I think of more than anything else as kind of a philosophy toy .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA we actually play through many generations here ,COMMA at the cellular scale .PERIOD
But basically ,COMMA this is the editor where we're going to design the next generation of our creature .PERIOD So it has a little spine .PERIOD
But really the goal here was ,COMMA within about a minute ,COMMA I wanted somebody to replicate what typically takes a pictorial artist several weeks to create .PERIOD
OK ,COMMA now I'll put some hands on it .PERIOD
And I can see how it might dance .PERIOD
I can also play with the dynamics of this world over time .PERIOD
And our cities are going to be at risk too ,COMMA because a lot of these are coastal cities .PERIOD
Here it is ,COMMA some indigenous life down here .PERIOD
You see ,COMMA now they've actually gone to tribal dynamics .PERIOD
I think I'll leave before they get hostile .PERIOD
But these are the things that we can kind of put in this little galaxy here .PERIOD
Because I think most of the problems that our world is facing right now is the result of short-term thinking ,COMMA and the fact that it is so hard for us to think 50 ,COMMA 100 ,COMMA or 1000 years out .PERIOD
And so I'm going to talk a little bit about that ,COMMA keeping in mind that we have a lot on the program here .PERIOD
What's in it for the ant ?QUESTIONMARK
No ,COMMA it's worse than that .PERIOD
There are a lot of ideas to die for .PERIOD
The secret of happiness is :COLON Find something more important than you are and dedicate your life to it .PERIOD
Actually ,COMMA I think we're all responsible for not just the intended effects of our ideas ,COMMA but for their likely misuses .PERIOD
So let me just point out :COLON memes are like viruses .PERIOD
And you might think ,COMMA Well ,COMMA how can that be ?QUESTIONMARK
They're made of information ,COMMA and can be carried in any physical medium .PERIOD
Not just the priests .PERIOD Everybody .PERIOD
After all ,COMMA the meme for Shaker-dom was essentially a sterilizing parasite .PERIOD
But among all those ideas that inevitably flow out into the whole world thanks to our technology ,COMMA are a lot of toxic ideas .PERIOD
And it's not our fault ,COMMA anymore than it's our fault when our germs lay waste to people that haven't developed the immunity .PERIOD
We drove to the Goodwill and we threw the sweater away somewhat ceremoniously ,COMMA my idea being that I would never have to think about the sweater nor see it ever again .PERIOD
I tell that story ,COMMA because it has served and continues to serve as a metaphor to me about the level of connectedness that we all have on this Earth .PERIOD
It's thrilling .PERIOD
First ,COMMA she talked about comfort ,COMMA status ,COMMA beauty .PERIOD
And we've started making curtains ,COMMA and not only is it beautiful ,COMMA but people can see status -- that you care about your children .PERIOD
Thank you .PERIOD
My job depends upon it .PERIOD
Up to and around about the Second World War ,COMMA conductors were invariably dictators -- these tyrannical figures who would rehearse ,COMMA not just the orchestra as a whole ,COMMA but individuals within it ,COMMA within an inch of their lives .PERIOD
Let's be under no illusions .PERIOD
Simply through singing .PERIOD
So we got some shows off the ground .PERIOD We started touring them internationally .PERIOD
One of them was Carmen .PERIOD
I want to play you a tiny clip of it now for no other reason than to give you proof positive that there is nothing tiny about South African music making .PERIOD
They don't read music .PERIOD
And yet ,COMMA ladies and gentlemen ,COMMA every single one of us on this planet probably engages with music on a daily basis .PERIOD
I've got a little experiment I want to try with you .PERIOD
T ,COMMA see it's the same as F in music .PERIOD
There I am like a bloody windmill again ,COMMA you see .PERIOD
The music will start ,COMMA and then at a signal from me ,COMMA you will sing that .PERIOD
One more time ,COMMA with feeling ,COMMA ladies and gentlemen .PERIOD
It's going to be Britain's first ever national disabled orchestra .PERIOD
Clarence :COLON I would rather be able to play an instrument again than walk .PERIOD
I only wish that some of those musicians were here with us today ,COMMA so you could see at firsthand how utterly extraordinary they are .PERIOD
If any of you thinks you want to help me in any way to achieve what is a fairly impossible and implausible dream still at this point ,COMMA please let me know .PERIOD
Haydn remonstrated with the prince ,COMMA but to no avail .PERIOD
♫ Like the heather ♫ ♫ on the hillside ♫ ♫ as they drove us ♫ ♫ from the Highlands ♫ ♫ Like the ice flow ♫ ♫ from the Arctic ♫ ♫ where we landed ♫ ♫ in Newfoundland ♫ ♫ There's a color ♫ ♫ to my sorrow ♫ ♫ There's a name for ♫ ♫ all this sadness ♫ ♫ Like the ocean ♫ ♫ in between us ♫ ♫ I am blue ♫ ♫ Blue is a river ♫ ♫ Blue remembered ♫ ♫ Blue water ♫ ♫ running clear ♫ ♫ Blue like a planet ♫ ♫ to a spaceman ♫ ♫ Blue river ♫ ♫ of my tears ♫ ♫ So I came here ♫ ♫ to the city ♫ ♫ where the dream burns ♫ ♫ like a furnace ♫ ♫ And I dazzled ♫ ♫ in these dark streets ♫ ♫ like a diamond ♫ ♫ in a coalface ♫ ♫ Then the cold wind ♫ ♫ from the islands ♫ ♫ blew a storm cloud ♫ ♫ across the new moon ♫ ♫ Like the gun smoke ♫ ♫ above the houses ♫ ♫ in my home ♫ ♫ Blue is a river ♫ ♫ Blue remembered ♫ ♫ Blue water ♫ ♫ running clear ♫ ♫ Blue like a planet ♫ ♫ to a spaceman ♫ ♫ Blue river ♫ ♫ of my tears ♫ ♫ Blue river ♫ ♫ of my tears ♫ Well ,COMMA the subject of difficult negotiation reminds me of one of my favorite stories from the Middle East ,COMMA of a man who left to his three sons 17 camels .PERIOD
Seventeen doesn't divide by two .PERIOD
The wise old woman thought about their problem for a long time ,COMMA and finally she came back and said ,COMMA Well ,COMMA I don't know if I can help you ,COMMA but at least ,COMMA if you want ,COMMA you can have my camel .PERIOD
They had one camel left over .PERIOD
Now if you think about that story for a moment ,COMMA I think it resembles a lot of the difficult negotiations we get involved in .PERIOD
As I've spent the last better part of three decades ,COMMA almost four ,COMMA traveling the world ,COMMA trying to work ,COMMA getting involved in conflicts ranging from Yugoslavia to the Middle East to Chechnya to Venezuela ,COMMA some of the most difficult conflicts on the face of the planet ,COMMA I've been asking myself that question .PERIOD
So how do they deal with their differences ?QUESTIONMARK
But what we don't often see is that there's always a third side ,COMMA and the third side of the conflict is us ,COMMA it's the surrounding community ,COMMA it's the friends ,COMMA the allies ,COMMA the family members ,COMMA the neighbors .PERIOD
Perhaps the most fundamental way in which the third side can help is to remind the parties of what's really at stake .PERIOD
And we met in the Hague ,COMMA in the Peace Palace ,COMMA in the same room where the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal was taking place .PERIOD
And then he went on ,COMMA and then he turned to me and said ,COMMA You're an American .PERIOD
Now I don't pretend to have an answer to the Middle East conflict ,COMMA but I think I've got a first step ,COMMA literally ,COMMA a first step ,COMMA something that any one of us could do as third-siders .PERIOD
And so my question is ,COMMA yes ,COMMA let's try and resolve the politics there in the Middle East ,COMMA but let's also take a look at the story .PERIOD
Let's see if we can apply the third side to it .PERIOD
What would that mean ?QUESTIONMARK What is the story there ?QUESTIONMARK
Now as anthropologists ,COMMA we know that every culture has an origin story .PERIOD
That man ,COMMA of course ,COMMA was Abraham .PERIOD
What's the opposite of terrorism ?QUESTIONMARK
It's taking an innocent stranger and treating them as a friend whom you welcome into your home in order to sow and create understanding ,COMMA or respect ,COMMA or love .PERIOD
And that's what comes to the first step here .PERIOD
That's the essence of the Abraham path .PERIOD
So what we discovered is that Abraham is not just a figure out of a book for those people .PERIOD
And just a couple weeks ago ,COMMA there was an NPR story on it .PERIOD
And they quoted a villager who said ,COMMA This walk connects us to the world .PERIOD
She's partially blind ,COMMA her husband can't work ,COMMA she's got seven kids .PERIOD
And so more and more walkers have come ,COMMA and lately she's begun to earn an income to support her family .PERIOD
So my question is ,COMMA if it can be done in Europe ,COMMA why not in the Middle East ?QUESTIONMARK
That's walking Abraham's path .PERIOD
After a TEDTalk ,COMMA why not a TEDWalk ?QUESTIONMARK
There's an old African proverb that goes :COLON When spider webs unite ,COMMA they can halt even the lion .PERIOD
If we're able to unite our third-side webs of peace ,COMMA we can even halt the lion of war .PERIOD
Well ,COMMA what is needed for the earliest possible warning of a heart attack ?QUESTIONMARK
A means to determine if there's a complete blockage of a coronary artery .PERIOD
And if we had a computer put into the body of a person who's at risk ,COMMA we could know ,COMMA before they even have symptoms ,COMMA that they're having a heart attack ,COMMA to save their life .PERIOD
And what we tried with the pig was external electrodes on the skin ,COMMA like you see in an emergency room ,COMMA and I'm going to show you why they don't work very well .PERIOD
Next to it ,COMMA at 30 seconds ,COMMA you see this rise here ,COMMA then this rise -- that's the ST elevation .PERIOD
Then ,COMMA on Friday at 643 ,COMMA he began to get certain signs ,COMMA which later we had the pig run around -- I'm not going to go into this early stage .PERIOD
Finally ,COMMA if you're lucky ,COMMA you are treated in three or four hours after the incident ,COMMA but the heart muscle has died .PERIOD
And now I want to talk about something entirely different .PERIOD
So here's a picture of what we're doing .PERIOD
There's this migraine that is preceded by a visual aura ,COMMA and this visual aura ,COMMA by the way -- and I'll show you a picture -- but it sort of begins with little dancing lights ,COMMA gets bigger and bigger until it fills your whole visual field .PERIOD
Christina Sidebottom :COLON Well ,COMMA my first reaction was that it was -- looked awfully gun-like ,COMMA and it was very strange .PERIOD
The most severe headaches responded better after we did it several times ,COMMA and the unexpected finding indicates that even established headaches ,COMMA not only those with aura ,COMMA get treated and get diminished .PERIOD
Well ,COMMA responsive electrical stimulation means that we sense ,COMMA at a place in your brain which is called an epileptic focus ,COMMA which is where the epileptic seizure begins -- we sense there ,COMMA that it's going to happen ,COMMA and then we respond by applying an electrical energy at that spot ,COMMA which erases the errant signal so that you don't get the clinical manifestations of the migraine headache .PERIOD
That concludes my discussion of epilepsy ,COMMA which is the third invention that I want to discuss here this afternoon .PERIOD
We want to have some people ,COMMA who really know how to do this ,COMMA perform human engineering studies to develop the optimum design for the portable device for treating migraine headaches .PERIOD
And that is the second wish .PERIOD
We needed to take what we had built and create a platform out of it so that it could be used elsewhere in the world .PERIOD
And so there is a team of developers from all over Africa ,COMMA who are part of this team now -- from Ghana ,COMMA from Malawi ,COMMA from Kenya .PERIOD
What is the veracity level of what you're looking at ?QUESTIONMARK
So you've got a lot of information .PERIOD That's great .PERIOD
Take the crowd and apply them to the information .PERIOD
And we are very happy to be part of the TED family .PERIOD
It's inevitable ,COMMA terrible ,COMMA but really what I want to talk about is ,COMMA I'm just fascinated by the legacy people leave when they die .PERIOD
A value for things with a personal touch -- an autograph book ,COMMA a soul-searching letter .PERIOD
If a fraction of this powerful TED audience could be inspired to buy a beautiful paper -- John ,COMMA it'll be a recycled one -- and write a beautiful letter to someone they love ,COMMA we actually may start a revolution where our children may go to penmanship classes .PERIOD
So what do I plan to leave for my son ?QUESTIONMARK
I plan to publish my own notebook .PERIOD
I have no idea how I'm going to do it ,COMMA but I am committed to compiling his thoughts and mine into a book ,COMMA and leave that published book for my son .PERIOD
What's happened in the music world is there's a culture or an ecosystem that's been created that ,COMMA if you take some words from Apple ,COMMA the catchphrase that we create ,COMMA rip ,COMMA mix and burn .PERIOD
And what that's done is it's created ,COMMA like I said ,COMMA a vibrant community that's very inclusive with people continually working to connect musical ideas ,COMMA innovate them and keep things constantly up to date .PERIOD
Imagine making it free ,COMMA so that anyone in the world can have access to all of this knowledge ,COMMA and imagine using information technology so that you can update this content ,COMMA improve it ,COMMA play with it ,COMMA on a timescale that's more on the order of seconds instead of years .PERIOD
In fact ,COMMA a lot of this use coming from Unites States ,COMMA K-through- 12 schools because anyone who's involved in a school scale back ,COMMA the first thing that's cut is the music curriculum and so this is just indicating the tremendous thirst for this kind of open ,COMMA free content .PERIOD
We've been working with AMD ,COMMA which has a project called 50 by ' 15 ,COMMA which is trying to bring Internet connectivity to 50 percent of the world's population by 2015 .PERIOD
In particular ,COMMA a bunch of the projects that are funded by Hewlett Foundation ,COMMA who have taken a real leadership role in this area of open content .PERIOD
OK ,COMMA burn ,COMMA I think this is sort of ,COMMA quite interesting .PERIOD
How much would it cost in a bookstore ?QUESTIONMARK
Why does it cost 22 dollars ?QUESTIONMARK
Remember we took the book ,COMMA tore the pages out ?QUESTIONMARK
Imagine music XML that actually lets you delve into the semantic structure of music ,COMMA play with it ,COMMA understand it .PERIOD
Even the three wise men .PERIOD
Because we're saying that anybody can contribute things to this commons .PERIOD Anybody can contribute anything .PERIOD
So ,COMMA thanks very much .PERIOD
I've been at MIT for 44 years .PERIOD I went to TED I .PERIOD
Everybody agrees that whatever the solutions are to the big problems ,COMMA they include education ,COMMA sometimes can be just education ,COMMA and can never be without some element of education .PERIOD
So with those as the principles -- some of you may know Seymour Papert ;SEMICOLON this is back in 1982 ,COMMA when we were working in Senegal .PERIOD
Here we're in the ' 80 s .PERIOD
And these kids ,COMMA their first English word is Google ,COMMA and they only know Skype .PERIOD They've never heard of telephony .PERIOD
Screw you .PERIOD Go to the back of the line and someone else will do it ,COMMA and then when you figure out that this works ,COMMA you can join as well .PERIOD
And the idea is to launch with enough scale that the scale itself helps bring the price down ,COMMA and that's why I said seven to 10 million there .PERIOD
Now once people start looking at this ,COMMA they say ,COMMA ah ,COMMA this is a laptop project .PERIOD
Because laptop economics are the following :COLON I say 50 percent here ;SEMICOLON it's more like 60 ,COMMA 60 percent of the cost of your laptop is sales ,COMMA marketing ,COMMA distribution and profit .PERIOD
OK ,COMMA I've been using laptops since their inception .PERIOD
The dual mode display -- the idea is to have a display that both works outdoors -- isn't it fun using your cell phone outdoors in the sunlight ?QUESTIONMARK
And in about 30 days we'll know for sure whether this works .PERIOD
Probably the most important piece there is that the kids really can do the maintenance .PERIOD
So this is just a mechanical engineering sort of embodiment of it for you to play with .PERIOD
Everybody thinks they know about education ,COMMA a lot of culture is built into it as well .PERIOD
Well ,COMMA guess what ,COMMA we're not .PERIOD
Because there's no market for post office trucks .PERIOD
You can spray paint it ;SEMICOLON you can do anything you want .PERIOD
That came from a 1960 paper on space travel ,COMMA because ,COMMA if you think about it ,COMMA space is pretty awkward .PERIOD
He said ,COMMA No ,COMMA no ,COMMA no .PERIOD Here's a better way .PERIOD
And he said ,COMMA Well ,COMMA okay .PERIOD
And if you were able to print out everybody in your cell phone ,COMMA the room would be very crowded .PERIOD
These are the people that you have access to right now ,COMMA in general -- all of these people ,COMMA all of your friends and family that you can connect to .PERIOD
But when you actually visualize it ,COMMA all the connections that we're doing right now -- this is an image of the mapping of the Internet -- it doesn't look technological .PERIOD
It actually looks very organic .PERIOD
It's that they're helping us to be more human ,COMMA helping us to connect with each other .PERIOD
We're just increasing our humanness and our ability to connect with each other ,COMMA regardless of geography .PERIOD
So that's why I study cyborg anthropology .PERIOD
and people are initially reluctant to tell you .PERIOD
We talk about things in relative terms .PERIOD
And so when we look at these PMTCT programs ,COMMA what does it mean ?QUESTIONMARK
Imagine yourself ,COMMA if you can ,COMMA you're a young woman in Africa ,COMMA you're going to the hospital or clinic .PERIOD
And you don't know who you can talk to ,COMMA because the truth is ,COMMA HIV is so stigmatizing that if you partner ,COMMA your family ,COMMA anyone in your home ,COMMA you're likely to be thrown out without any means of support .PERIOD
And this -- this is the face and story of HIV in Africa today .PERIOD
But we're here to talk about possible solutions and some good news .PERIOD
Our organization ,COMMA mothers 2 mothers ,COMMA enlists women with HIV as care providers .PERIOD
But if you wanted to understand what that surgery would do to your life ,COMMA you'd like to engage someone ,COMMA someone who's had the procedure .PERIOD
And so doctors and nurses -- they look up to them as experts .PERIOD
Men are not frequently part of pregnancy care .PERIOD
And this is so important in breaking through the stigma .PERIOD
And if we can change enough communities ,COMMA we can change national attitudes .PERIOD
We have the medicines ,COMMA we have the tests ,COMMA but how do you reduce the stigma ?QUESTIONMARK
I've been afraid to tell everybody .PERIOD
How do you build a better health care system ?QUESTIONMARK
And our organization helps women across that bridge .PERIOD
The program is now working in nine countries ,COMMA we have 670 program sites ,COMMA we're seeing about 230000 women every month ,COMMA we're employing 1600 mentor mothers ,COMMA and last year ,COMMA they enrolled 300000 HIV-positive pregnant women and mothers .PERIOD
All of this is possible ,COMMA if we each contribute to this fight .PERIOD
Thank you .PERIOD
Then they irradiate our food ,COMMA trying to make it last longer ,COMMA so it can travel thousands of miles from where it's grown to the supermarkets .PERIOD
This man ,COMMA Joel Salatin ,COMMA they call him a lunatic farmer because he grows against the system .PERIOD
Since I'm home-schooled ,COMMA I went to go hear him speak one day .PERIOD
I want you to know that there are farmers' markets in every community popping up .PERIOD
Not too long ago ,COMMA my uncle said that he offered my six-year-old cousin cereal .PERIOD
Now we had a Harvard professor here -- she was from Harvard ,COMMA I just wanted to mention and -- and she was actually a professor from Harvard .PERIOD
The scales here are religiosity from zero percent ,COMMA or atheist ,COMMA to 100 percent ,COMMA Bible literally true .PERIOD
Now let's talk about some of the characteristics that are important for this revolutionary device .PERIOD
First of all ,COMMA it needs to be small .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA I bought this device from Clifford Stoll for about 900 bucks .PERIOD
Free Bird .PERIOD
OK ,COMMA one more time -- I'm just going to give you a little help .PERIOD
And finally ,COMMA we're going to put the Marriott Hotel and the Portola Plaza on the top .PERIOD
Mr .PERIOD Vice President ,COMMA I wish I knew how to quit you .PERIOD
And Sylvia Earle and I were on an expedition in this submarine 20 years ago in Japan .PERIOD
But when I got there ,COMMA I found lots of plastic garbage and other debris .PERIOD
It's in the mid-Pacific .PERIOD It's about five days from anywhere .PERIOD
So that's when I first learned of the Islands and had no idea what I was getting into .PERIOD
It's a very deep-water part of our planet .PERIOD
But we got up there ,COMMA and I had the unique and wonderful scientific opportunity and personal opportunity to get to a place that had never been dived and just get to an island and go ,COMMA Okay ,COMMA where are we going to dive ?QUESTIONMARK
Let's try there ,COMMA and then falling into the water .PERIOD
The Phoenix Islands and all the equatorial parts of our planet are very important for tuna fisheries ,COMMA especially this yellowfin tuna that you see here .PERIOD
So I thought the scenes of never-ending wilderness would go on forever ,COMMA but they did finally come to an end .PERIOD
They basically are one nation that controls most of the equatorial waters of the Central Pacific Ocean .PERIOD
And for some reason they didn't want me to come ,COMMA or it was hard to find a time and a place ,COMMA and it took a while ,COMMA but finally they said ,COMMA Okay ,COMMA you can come .PERIOD
And I was free for dinner ,COMMA and I went out to dinner with the Minister of Fisheries in Kiribati .PERIOD
It had occurred on land ,COMMA in rainforests of South America and Africa ,COMMA where landowners had been paid not to cut the trees down .PERIOD
So we had very strong leadership ,COMMA very good vision and a lot of science ,COMMA a lot of lawyers involved .PERIOD
So suddenly we had this area that we were protecting ,COMMA but now it appeared to be dead ,COMMA at least in the coral areas .PERIOD
And that's the story with climate-change heating .PERIOD
And we are now in the process of raising the full endowment .PERIOD
And I actually went to see some of the design companies in Hong Kong in my stay there .PERIOD
And I'll just give you one example .PERIOD I had gotten my first Walkman .PERIOD
Last November ,COMMA a museum opened in Tokyo called The Mori Museum ,COMMA in a skyscraper ,COMMA up on the 56 th floor .PERIOD
And ,COMMA for sure ,COMMA I haven't looked at the sky in the same way after spending an hour in there .PERIOD
You know ,COMMA one is :COLON just working without pressure .PERIOD
This is ,COMMA you know ,COMMA related to it :COLON getting out of the studio .PERIOD
Again ,COMMA we could supply the content for it .PERIOD
Icons like Batman ,COMMA Superman ,COMMA Wonder Woman and their colleagues will be teaming up with icons Jabbar ,COMMA Noora ,COMMA Jami and their colleagues .PERIOD
As Christian iconography got changed ,COMMA and swastikas were created out of crucifixes ,COMMA Batman and Superman were created by Jewish young men in the United States and Canada ,COMMA also going back to the Bible .PERIOD
Superman is not only sent to Earth from the heavens ,COMMA or Krypton ,COMMA but he's sent in a pod ,COMMA much like Moses was on the Nile .PERIOD
So 33 of the stones are smuggled onto the Nina ,COMMA the Pinta and the Santa Maria and are spread in the New World .PERIOD
To which he said ,COMMA Let them be ,COMMA because what they're giving us is worth a lot more than what we're paying them .PERIOD
So these 99 stones ,COMMA a few kind of rules in the game :COLON Number one ,COMMA you don't choose the stone ;SEMICOLON the stone chooses you .PERIOD
Well .PERIOD
We have Jabbar from Saudi who starts breaking things when he has the power .PERIOD
I'm like ,COMMA are all the girls going to be kind and merciful and the guys all strong ?QUESTIONMARK
That's not timely .PERIOD
And that led to all kinds of things ,COMMA from being in curricula in universities and schools to -- one of my favorite pictures I have from South Asia ,COMMA it was a couple of men with long beards and a lot of girls wearing the hijab -- it looked like a school .PERIOD
Opened a theme park through a license in Kuwait a year and a half ago called The 99 Village Theme Park -- 300000 square feet ,COMMA 20 rides ,COMMA all with our characters :COLON a couple back-to-school licenses in Spain and Turkey .PERIOD
Rughal :COLON There must be something we can do .PERIOD
Dr .PERIOD Razem :COLON It's time to go ,COMMA Miklos .PERIOD
You are Noora the Light .PERIOD
I don't deserve it .PERIOD I don't deserve anything .PERIOD
Jabbar :COLON We're here to help you .PERIOD
Miklos :COLON No .PERIOD He gave me access ,COMMA and you want to reboot the [unclear] .PERIOD No more [unclear] .PERIOD
As the father of five sons ,COMMA I worry about who they're going to be using as role models .PERIOD
And torture's a terrible enough thing as it is ,COMMA but when it's done by your hero ,COMMA that just breaks you in so many ways .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA one of the things that I refer to when I -- about the importance of this message -- is that I gave a lecture at the medical school at Kuwait University ,COMMA where I lecture on the biological basis of behavior ,COMMA and I gave the students two articles ,COMMA one from The New York Times and one from New York magazine .PERIOD
Any boys and girls caught flirting would get married off immediately ,COMMA okay .PERIOD
The second one took place in upstate New York .PERIOD
She was actually coming out of an Amnesty International meeting .PERIOD
And the good news is there might be an easy solution to that ,COMMA and that's using our eyes more .PERIOD
And it mushroomed slightly .PERIOD Afghanistan and Iraq mushroomed now to 3000 billion .PERIOD
So there it is :COLON 227 billion is what Africa owes .PERIOD
And the recent financial crisis ,COMMA how much of this diagram might that figure take up ?QUESTIONMARK
We need to imagine what a landscape of the world's fears might look like .PERIOD
This is Mountains Out of Molehills ,COMMA a timeline of global media panic .PERIOD
And there's a very interesting and odd pattern hidden in this data that you can only see when you visualize it .PERIOD
Let me show you this .PERIOD
I'll take answers .PERIOD
I wonder if I could make my life beautiful .PERIOD
It's the language of the eye .PERIOD
But of course ,COMMA China has an enormous population .PERIOD
And if it can do that ,COMMA maybe it can also change your behavior .PERIOD
But what it points to is that visualizing information like this is a form of knowledge compression .PERIOD
So heart is filtered out ,COMMA so I can see if I'm curious about that .PERIOD
So the data is now alive ;SEMICOLON this is a living image ,COMMA and I can update it in a second .PERIOD
It's even fun to engage with them because it's visual .PERIOD
And that is beautiful .PERIOD Thank you .PERIOD
I will show it to you .PERIOD
The top note that you smelled at the very beginning ,COMMA the cut-grass green ,COMMA what we call in perfumery -- they’re weird terms -- and this would be called a green note ,COMMA because it smells of something green ,COMMA like cut grass .PERIOD
This is cis- 3 -hexene- 1 -ol .PERIOD And I had to learn chemistry on the fly in the last three years .PERIOD A very expensive high school chemistry education .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA this is a totally insane idea .PERIOD
And my definition of a theory is ,COMMA it’s not just something that you teach people ;SEMICOLON it’s labor saving .PERIOD
If it does ,COMMA you put the glass down ,COMMA you go to a different bar .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA I showed this to a physicist friend of mine who has a profound distaste for biology ,COMMA and he says ,COMMA That’s easy !EXCLAMATIONMARK The things are a different color !EXCLAMATIONMARK

And in an enormous 40 -page paper in German he says ,COMMA at one point -- my wife is German and she translated it for me -- and at one point he says ,COMMA ganz widerlich Geruch ,COMMA an absolutely repulsive smell ,COMMA which is good .PERIOD Reminiscent of hydrogen sulfide .PERIOD
And it’s fair to say that if you look up somebody’s nose ,COMMA you’re unlikely to see anything resembling this .PERIOD
OK .PERIOD Now .PERIOD If something absorbs the energy ,COMMA the electron can travel .PERIOD
What’s nice about this idea ,COMMA if you have a philosophical bent of mind ,COMMA is that then it tells you that the nose ,COMMA the ear and the eye are all vibrational senses .PERIOD
He says to me ,COMMA I bet you cannot make a coumarin .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA coumarin is a very common thing ,COMMA a material ,COMMA in fragrance which is derived from a bean that comes from South America .PERIOD
And :COLON You’re completely wrong ,COMMA and I’m sure you’re completely wrong .PERIOD
Working with the Harvard Business School ,COMMA you'll see this example when you talk about minimum payment :COLON If you spent 62 dollars for a meal ,COMMA the longer you take to pay out that loan ,COMMA you see ,COMMA over a period of time using the minimum payment it's 99 dollars and 17 cents .PERIOD
But it's going to work .PERIOD It's more effective than just computational aids .PERIOD
Received very favorably by business .PERIOD
And there is some good news to report today .PERIOD
There is no way we should do business with companies that have agreements with stealth provisions and that are unintelligible .PERIOD
Now we come down to it ,COMMA relatives grieving .PERIOD

I had saved a few hundred photos of dodo skeletons into my Creative Projects folder -- it's a repository for my brain ,COMMA everything that I could possibly be interested in .PERIOD
Assuming it was roughly the size of my wife's hand ,COMMA I made some measurements of her thumb ,COMMA and I scaled them out to the size of the skull .PERIOD
Built out of words ,COMMA it is the engine that drives the plot of his book and also the movie ,COMMA in which another object is created :COLON a prop that has to represent the thing that Hammett created out of words ,COMMA inspired by the Kniphausen Hawk ,COMMA and this represents the falcon in the movie .PERIOD
And so now it was time to do some research .PERIOD
What do they do ,COMMA how do you start something like that ?QUESTIONMARK I really don't know .PERIOD
And I'm following all the light kicks on this thing and making sure that as I'm holding the light in the same position ,COMMA I'm getting the same type of reflection on it -- that's the level of detail I'm going into this thing .PERIOD
This thing was made of resin and it was too light .PERIOD
That's half the weight of my dog ,COMMA Huxley .PERIOD
On the far left is a piece of crap -- a replica I bought on eBay .PERIOD
So what do I do ?QUESTIONMARK I figure I have two options .PERIOD
One ,COMMA I can fire a freaking laser at it ,COMMA which I have already done ,COMMA to do a 3 D scan -- there's a 3 D scan of this Falcon .PERIOD
But really ,COMMA if we're all going to be honest with ourselves ,COMMA I have to admit that achieving the end of the exercise was never the point of the exercise to begin with ,COMMA was it .PERIOD
It was actually developed for use by the offshore oil industry for diving on oil rigs down to a depth of 2000 feet .PERIOD
If I go out in the open ocean environment ,COMMA virtually anywhere in the world ,COMMA and I drag a net from 3000 feet to the surface ,COMMA most of the animals -- in fact ,COMMA in many places ,COMMA 80 to 90 percent of the animals that I bring up in that net -- make light .PERIOD
So you turn on the camera ,COMMA turn out the lights .PERIOD
I knew my forward speed ,COMMA I knew the area ,COMMA and so I could figure out how many hundreds of sources there were per cubic meter .PERIOD
So it uses its red bioluminescence like a sniper's scope to be able to sneak up on animals that are blind to red light and be able to see them without being seen .PERIOD
And a lot of animals will use their bioluminescence as a lure .PERIOD
So ,COMMA she's got a lure that she sticks out in front of this living mousetrap of needle-sharp teeth in order to attract in some unsuspecting prey .PERIOD
So ,COMMA now we believe that the different shape of the lure is how the male recognizes the female in the anglerfish world ,COMMA because many of these males are what are known as dwarf males .PERIOD
Well ,COMMA this is a deep-sea version of Women's Lib .PERIOD
She always knows where he is ,COMMA and she doesn't have to be monogamous ,COMMA because some of these females come up with multiple males attached .PERIOD
And we were using a special trawling net that we were able to bring these animals up alive .PERIOD
This is an unbelievable light show .PERIOD
So ,COMMA I've wanted for a long time to figure out a different way to explore .PERIOD
That's me on the left ,COMMA my graduate student at the time ,COMMA Erika Raymond ,COMMA and Lee Fry ,COMMA who was the engineer on the project .PERIOD
We're at the edge of the Brine Pool ,COMMA there's a fish that's swimming towards the camera .PERIOD
DNA :COLON Design ,COMMA Nature ,COMMA Art .PERIOD These are the three things that condition my world .PERIOD

It's like 21 st-century Henry Moore .PERIOD When you see a Henry Moore still ,COMMA your hair stands up .PERIOD There's some amazing spiritual connect .PERIOD
We need to be in that realm .PERIOD I want to do stuff like that .PERIOD

I'm not putting Charles Eames' furniture in buildings anymore .PERIOD
Who cares ?QUESTIONMARK
This is called a Plasnet .PERIOD
These are my sculptures .PERIOD
This is a room of sleep-deprived women .PERIOD
And in the course of that ,COMMA I studied ,COMMA I met with medical doctors ,COMMA scientists ,COMMA and I'm here to tell you that the way to a more productive ,COMMA more inspired ,COMMA more joyful life is getting enough sleep .PERIOD
And our guide was a local science teacher .PERIOD
At the end of this day I could have filled a book just with stories about law from this one teacher .PERIOD
We lack even a vocabulary to deal with this problem ,COMMA and that's because we have the wrong frame of reference .PERIOD
The trial lawyers say ,COMMA Well ,COMMA this legal fear makes doctors practice better medicine .PERIOD
The fear has chilled professional interaction so thousands of tragic errors occur because doctors are afraid to speak up :COLON Are you sure that's the right dosage ?QUESTIONMARK
it goes on .PERIOD We did a study of all the rules that affect one school in New York .PERIOD The Board of Ed .PERIOD had no idea .PERIOD
I mean it's just absolutely a formula for failure .PERIOD
And why not ?QUESTIONMARK They don't trust the law .PERIOD Why don't they trust the law ?QUESTIONMARK
Well how do you fix it ?QUESTIONMARK We could spend 10000 lifetimes trying to prune this legal jungle .PERIOD
But law is different than other kinds of uncertainties ,COMMA because it carries with it the power of state .PERIOD
If you make people self-conscious about their judgments ,COMMA studies show you will make them make worse judgments .PERIOD
Edison stated it best .PERIOD He said ,COMMA Hell ,COMMA we ain't got no rules around here ,COMMA we're trying to accomplish something .PERIOD
All these choices involve value judgments and social norms ,COMMA not objective facts .PERIOD
You can't run a society by the lowest common denominator .PERIOD
So ,COMMA what's needed is a basic shift in philosophy .PERIOD
Law is a human institution ;SEMICOLON responsibility is a human institution .PERIOD
If the judge doesn't have the authority to toss out unreasonable claims ,COMMA then all of us go through the day looking over our shoulders .PERIOD
What the world needs now is to restore the authority to make common choices .PERIOD
The second thing I want to do is introduce my co-author and dear friend and co-teacher .PERIOD
We certainly can't trust the bankers ,COMMA and we certainly can't trust the brokers .PERIOD
And even as we do our own work ,COMMA all too often ,COMMA we find ourselves having to choose between doing what we think is the right thing and doing the expected thing ,COMMA or the required thing ,COMMA or the profitable thing .PERIOD
Or if they do have our interests at heart ,COMMA we worry that they don't know us well enough to figure out what they need to do in order to allow us to secure those interests .PERIOD
In addition ,COMMA we are struggling to find some way to create incentives for people in the financial services industry that will have them more interested in serving the long-term interests even of their own companies ,COMMA rather than securing short-term profits .PERIOD
If there is a lesson to be learned from the financial collapse it is that .PERIOD
A wise person knows when to bend the rules .PERIOD
A wise person knows when to improvise .PERIOD
And most important ,COMMA a wise person does this improvising and rule-bending in the service of the right aims .PERIOD
He was supporting his wife and a child ,COMMA and the child was going to parochial school .PERIOD
Then he lost his job .PERIOD
The judge on the case ,COMMA Judge Lois Forer thought that this made no sense .PERIOD

In the Veterans' Court -- this was the first of its kind in the United States .PERIOD
Why has the idea spread ?QUESTIONMARK
Anyone would glom onto a criminal justice system that has this kind of a record .PERIOD
So here's is a system-changer ,COMMA and it seems to be catching .PERIOD
Aristotle thought that practical wisdom was the key to happiness ,COMMA and he was right .PERIOD
Indeed ,COMMA we argue ,COMMA there is no substitute for wisdom .PERIOD
First of all ,COMMA we started off the nuclear age in 1945 .PERIOD
We had a few nuclear weapons ,COMMA two of which we dropped on Japan ,COMMA in Hiroshima ,COMMA a few days later in Nagasaki ,COMMA in August 1945 ,COMMA killing about 250000 people between those two .PERIOD
So the goal was to evacuate the target cities .PERIOD
We would move people out of the target cities into the countryside .PERIOD
This disconnect was never actually resolved .PERIOD
So ,COMMA what is a nuclear terror threat ?QUESTIONMARK
There are plans for how to create a terror farm where you could actually manufacture and develop all the components and assemble it .PERIOD
Since there is no real retribution possible that would make any difference ,COMMA since there are people willing to actually give up their lives in order to do a lot of damage to us ,COMMA it becomes apparent that the whole notion of this mutually assured destruction would not work .PERIOD
You take it wherever you want to take it ,COMMA and you can detonate it .PERIOD
You can't get an exact number for that kind of probability ,COMMA but what I'm trying to say is that we have all the elements of that happening .PERIOD
I don't think we would see an all-out nuclear war any time soon ,COMMA although even that is not completely off the table .PERIOD
There's still enough nuclear weapons in the arsenals of the superpowers to destroy the Earth many ,COMMA many times over .PERIOD
We're coming down ,COMMA and we bring that truck that you just saw somewhere in here ,COMMA in the Financial District .PERIOD
This is a 10 -kiloton bomb ,COMMA slightly smaller than was used in Hiroshima .PERIOD And I want to just conclude this by just giving you some information .PERIOD I think -- news you could use kind of concept here .PERIOD
And if you're in this vicinity ,COMMA you've got to get away .PERIOD
And if you're wearing clothing ,COMMA you've taken off your clothing ,COMMA you're going to get showered down some place and remove the radiation that would be -- the radioactive material that might be on you .PERIOD
Thank you .PERIOD
No ,COMMA no ,COMMA I wasn't 14 years old .PERIOD
I wasn't really a rocket scientist ,COMMA but I was working at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in sunny California where it's warm ;SEMICOLON whereas now I'm in the mid-West ,COMMA and it's cold .PERIOD
And he told me ,COMMA Biosignatures ,COMMA we need to look for a biosignature .PERIOD
And he said ,COMMA It's any measurable phenomenon that allows us to indicate the presence of life .PERIOD
But immediately the system goes like ,COMMA What kind of dumb piece of code was this ?QUESTIONMARK
So you see waves of new types taking over the other types .PERIOD
As long as I know that there's some sort of alphabet .PERIOD
And obviously each of these letters comes off about roughly equally frequent .PERIOD
And if I look at French texts ,COMMA it looks a little bit different ,COMMA or Italian or German .PERIOD
It doesn't matter whether it's a poem or whether it's a mathematical text .PERIOD
The Avidians being the denizens of this computer world where they are perfectly happy replicating and growing in complexity .PERIOD
Too hot ,COMMA too hot .PERIOD
And I'm just showing this to you again because it's so nice .PERIOD
One of them is ,COMMA if we are able to think about life in abstract terms -- and we're not talking about things like plants ,COMMA and we're not talking about amino acids ,COMMA and we're not talking about bacteria ,COMMA but we think in terms of processes -- then we could start to think about life ,COMMA not as something that is so special to Earth ,COMMA but that ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA could exist anywhere .PERIOD
But what really turns me on about technology is not just the ability to get more songs on MP 3 players .PERIOD
What I would like to see is idealism decoupled from all constraints .PERIOD
Political ,COMMA economic ,COMMA psychological ,COMMA whatever .PERIOD
Don't ask .PERIOD
Well ,COMMA I turned him down .PERIOD
That's not a cause .PERIOD That's an emergency .PERIOD
And what we're facing in Africa is an unprecedented threat to human dignity and equality .PERIOD
That's right .PERIOD
We like to give ,COMMA and we give a lot .PERIOD
You see ,COMMA Africa makes a fool of our idea of justice .PERIOD
Africa is a continent in flames .PERIOD
Anyway ,COMMA I believe that that kind of thinking offends the intellectual rigor in this room .PERIOD
There's an opportunity here ,COMMA and it's real .PERIOD
Our credibility ?QUESTIONMARK
I can't ;SEMICOLON you can't ,COMMA as individuals ;SEMICOLON but we can change the world .PERIOD
But working together ,COMMA we can actually change the world .PERIOD
Ideas that you gestated in your youth .PERIOD
Well ,COMMA now ,COMMA actually because of you ,COMMA it is possible to change the physical world .PERIOD
So why ,COMMA then ,COMMA are we not pumping our fists into the air ?QUESTIONMARK
But for the first time in history ,COMMA we have the technology ;SEMICOLON we have the know-how ;SEMICOLON we have the cash ;SEMICOLON we have the life-saving drugs .PERIOD
The Clash wore big army boots ,COMMA not sandals .PERIOD
But some of them they haven't .PERIOD
Not only in lives saved ,COMMA but in goodwill ,COMMA stability and security that we'll gain .PERIOD
What I hope is that beyond individual merciful acts ,COMMA that you will tell the politicians to do right by Africa ,COMMA by America and by the world .PERIOD
Give us that kind of dreaming ,COMMA that kind of doing .PERIOD
The war against terror ,COMMA yes .PERIOD
Actually we're talking to ABC today about the Oscars .PERIOD
We need to get the math ;SEMICOLON we need to get the statistics out to the American people .PERIOD
One by one they step forward ,COMMA a nurse ,COMMA a teacher ,COMMA a homemaker ,COMMA and lives are saved .PERIOD
We can make history .PERIOD
We can start to make poverty history .PERIOD
The idea that the Internet ,COMMA which changed all of our lives ,COMMA can transform a country -- and a continent that has hardly made it to analog ,COMMA let alone digital -- blows my mind .PERIOD
Communication is very important for Ethiopia -- will transform the country .PERIOD
I am ,COMMA of course ,COMMA referring to none other than Elvis Presley .PERIOD
And love is not love ,COMMA but being all shook up .PERIOD
Does that correspond ?QUESTIONMARK
Metaphor creates a kind of conceptual synesthesia ,COMMA in which we understand one concept in the context of another .PERIOD
One of the sentences was ,COMMA Some jobs are jails .PERIOD
And they had those expectations because agent metaphors imply the deliberate action of a living thing pursuing a goal .PERIOD
But there is a better translation .PERIOD
The Latin word cogito is derived from the prefix co ,COMMA meaning together ,COMMA and the verb agitare ,COMMA meaning to shake .PERIOD
And in that sense ,COMMA ballooning is a beautiful metaphor .PERIOD
We want to go in a direction ,COMMA but the winds push us in another direction ,COMMA like in life .PERIOD
And as long as we fight horizontally ,COMMA against life ,COMMA against the winds ,COMMA against what's happening to us ,COMMA life is a nightmare .PERIOD
How do we go from the metaphor to something more practical that we can really use every day ?QUESTIONMARK
It's not true .PERIOD
This is very practical .PERIOD
This is why you need people with long-term vision .PERIOD
But we were expected to have doubts ;SEMICOLON we're expected to have fears .PERIOD
It's to show you how much gas was left in the last bottles .PERIOD
We landed with 40 kilos .PERIOD

And when the capsule of my balloon was introduced officially in the Air and Space Museum in Washington ,COMMA together with the airplane of Charles Lindbergh ,COMMA with Apollo 11 ,COMMA with the Wright Brothers' Flyer ,COMMA with Chuck Yeager's 61 ,COMMA I had really a thought then .PERIOD
It will be prohibited because we'll have to save our natural resources in a few decades from now .PERIOD
Which means that they have more proven the limits of renewable energies than the potential of it .PERIOD
The goal is to take off ,COMMA end of this year for the first test ,COMMA but mainly next year ,COMMA spring or summer ,COMMA take off ,COMMA on our own power ,COMMA without additional help ,COMMA without being towed ,COMMA climb to 9000 meters altitude .PERIOD
So ,COMMA you see that this airplane is more a symbol .PERIOD
I don't think it will transport 200 people in the next years .PERIOD
And 20 years later there were 200 people in every airplane crossing the Atlantic .PERIOD
And each time we have some ice in the future ,COMMA we have to know that life will be great ,COMMA and the success will be brilliant if we dare to overcome our fear of the ice ,COMMA to go through the obstacle ,COMMA to go through the problem ,COMMA in order to see what there is on the other side .PERIOD
I wish I could show you my Yemen .PERIOD
It was very hard ,COMMA you know ,COMMA to impose my authority .PERIOD
But a woman's got to do what a woman's got to do .PERIOD
It's about proving who you are and what you can do .PERIOD
But in assuming this responsibility and going about it as you have ,COMMA you have become a bridge between an older and traditional society and the one that you are now creating at the paper .PERIOD
And this is true .PERIOD
Well the Yemen Times ,COMMA across 20 years ,COMMA has been through so much .PERIOD
They think that if there's anything against them ,COMMA then we are being an opposition newspaper .PERIOD
And very ,COMMA very difficult times .PERIOD
And he ended up writing about a story that even surprised me -- hip hop -- that there are young Yemeni men who express themselves through dancing and puchu puchu .PERIOD
That thing .PERIOD
I'm not so old .PERIOD
Actually ,COMMA that's a documentary that's available online ;SEMICOLON the video's online .PERIOD
And certainly you yourself and what you do have given us a view of the future that we will embrace and be grateful for .PERIOD
On Twitter also .PERIOD
And it doesn't take much time to discover some really astonishing statistics with this issue .PERIOD
It's the number one contaminant of groundwater ,COMMA drinking water ,COMMA rain water .PERIOD
In some cases ,COMMA another species like the North American Leopard Frog showed that males exposed to atrazine grew eggs in their testes .PERIOD
Normally the testes should make testosterone ,COMMA the male hormone .PERIOD
In fact ,COMMA this aromatase is so important in breast cancer that the latest treatment for breast cancer is a chemical called letrozole ,COMMA which blocks aromatase ,COMMA blocks estrogen ,COMMA so that if you developed a mutated cell ,COMMA it doesn't grow into a tumor .PERIOD
PJC :COLON So speaking of estrogen ,COMMA one of the other compounds that Tyrone talks about in the film is something called bisphenol A ,COMMA BPA ,COMMA which has been in the news recently .PERIOD
So we're dosing our babies ,COMMA our newborns ,COMMA our infants ,COMMA with a synthetic estrogen .PERIOD
So the pup you see on the bottom is affected by atrazine that its grandmother was exposed to .PERIOD
And given the life of many of these chemicals ,COMMA generations ,COMMA years ,COMMA dozens of years ,COMMA that means that we right now are affecting the health of our grandchildren's grandchildren by things that we're putting into the environment today .PERIOD
And this was something that was really brought home to me a year ago when I found out I was pregnant and the first scan revealed that my baby had a birth defect associated with exposure to estrogenic chemicals in the womb and the second scan revealed no heartbeat .PERIOD
We know so much about global warming and climate change ,COMMA and yet ,COMMA we have no concept of what I've been calling internal environmentalism .PERIOD
I'm not married ,COMMA but one year ago today ,COMMA I woke up from a month-long coma ,COMMA following a double lung transplant .PERIOD

Literally hundreds of elevator rides were spent with me alone stuffing the pump into my Spanx ,COMMA hoping the doors wouldn't open unexpectedly .PERIOD
Against my doctors' and family's wishes ,COMMA I needed to go back for the funeral .PERIOD
I was dying ,COMMA and if I didn't mix that stuff up fast ,COMMA I would never leave that apartment alive .PERIOD
I went back to the States ,COMMA anticipating I'd return to Europe ,COMMA but the heart catheterization showed that I wasn't going anywhere further that a flight-for-life from Johns Hopkins Hospital .PERIOD
A happy patient is a healthy patient .PERIOD
And it was right-heart failure .PERIOD
It was a match .PERIOD
Because ,COMMA despite their problems ,COMMA I had spent my whole life training my lungs ,COMMA and I was not particularly enthusiastic about giving them up .PERIOD
They left my chest open for two weeks .PERIOD
An infection ravaged my skin .PERIOD

Children are incredibly adept at climbing trees .PERIOD
That's my son ,COMMA Oliver .PERIOD
If ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny ,COMMA then children are somewhat closer to our roots as primates in the arboreal forest .PERIOD
You ascend 30 stories .PERIOD
And there's also something that I want to show you .PERIOD
The scientists are doing all kinds of experiments in these trees .PERIOD
We're looking at the very top of Gaya ,COMMA which is thought to be the oldest Redwood .PERIOD
What can the Redwoods tell us about ourselves ?QUESTIONMARK
The flickering ,COMMA transitory quality of human time and the brevity of human life -- the necessity to love .PERIOD
And I think that one of the happiest things is the sense that with my children I've been able to introduce them into the very small circle of humans who are lucky enough ,COMMA or possibly stupid enough ,COMMA to still climb trees .PERIOD
But that's just a very small facet of a much greater problem of invasions of species worldwide ,COMMA all through the ecosystems ,COMMA and you know ,COMMA the Earth itself -- CA :COLON Partly caused by us ,COMMA inadvertently .PERIOD

There are lots of people shaping decisions and so if we want to predict correctly we have to pay attention to everybody who is trying to shape the outcome ,COMMA not just the people at the pinnacle of the decision-making pyramid .PERIOD
So with just that little bit of input we can work out what the choices are that people have ,COMMA what the chances are that they're willing to take ,COMMA what they're after ,COMMA what they value ,COMMA what they want ,COMMA and what they believe about other people .PERIOD
I remind you of that 90 percent accuracy rate .PERIOD

YouTube cares deeply about the rights of content owners ,COMMA but in order to give them choices about what they can do with copies ,COMMA mashups and more ,COMMA we need to first identify when copyrighted material is uploaded to our site .PERIOD

This is the universe of 2007 ,COMMA the last two months .PERIOD
But we can actually be more specific in defining our universe .PERIOD
So we see Obama and the Clintons meet in Alabama .PERIOD
You can see that this is an important story ;SEMICOLON there are a lot of things in its orbit .PERIOD If we open this up ,COMMA we get different perspectives on this story .PERIOD
And you'll all be able to use it and kind of explore what your own personal mythology might be .PERIOD
As you search for the things that are important to you in your world ,COMMA and then see what the constellations of those might look like .PERIOD
We're facing this problem .PERIOD
There is the problem .PERIOD
And you know ,COMMA going back maybe 10 years in time when I got the funding to buy my first graphics computer -- it was a huge machine .PERIOD
It was cabinets of processors and storage and everything .PERIOD
This is a data set that was captured using a CT scanner .PERIOD
And of course all the data is inside ,COMMA so I can start rotating ,COMMA I can look at it from different angles ,COMMA and I can see that this woman had a problem .PERIOD
And one of the applications that we've been working on -- and this has gotten a little bit of traction worldwide -- is the application of virtual autopsies .PERIOD
So this is from a virtual autopsy .PERIOD
The person was killed by stabs in the heart ,COMMA but they just deposited the knife by putting it through one of the eyeballs .PERIOD
Here's another case that I think is interesting .PERIOD
During a physical autopsy ,COMMA if you actually have to dig through the body to find these fragments ,COMMA that's actually quite hard to do .PERIOD
So if you have the opportunity ,COMMA please try it out .PERIOD
It's really a hands-on experience .PERIOD
And this is a bit of science fiction now ,COMMA so we're moving into really the future .PERIOD
And he's also hearing our instructions when we tell him to do things .PERIOD
And in just a second here you will see -- okay ,COMMA here .PERIOD Motts ,COMMA now move your left foot .PERIOD
I can look inside of it .PERIOD
And here it is .PERIOD Here is the nose of the bear .PERIOD
Well ,COMMA 80 percent of the men in Lesotho worked in the mines over the border ,COMMA in brutal conditions .PERIOD
He was the son of one of the poorest families in the village .PERIOD
Perhaps the universe existed before the bang ,COMMA and the bang was just a violent event in a pre-existing universe .PERIOD
I won't go into the details of why we think the universe is like this ,COMMA but it comes out of the math and trying to explain the physics that we know .PERIOD
And there've been bangs in the past ,COMMA and there will be bangs in the future .PERIOD
What about Africa ?QUESTIONMARK
It's still going on .PERIOD
What about Africa's capacity to do something about these problems ?QUESTIONMARK
Well ,COMMA here's the number of physicians in Africa .PERIOD
And while I was busy working -- I was working on these colliding worlds ,COMMA in the day .PERIOD
And we got lots of applicants .PERIOD
You have to rethink ,COMMA what is the university for ?QUESTIONMARK
No droning on at the chalkboard .PERIOD
Everyone lives together in this hotel -- lecturers and students -- and it's not surprising at all to find an impromptu tutorial at 1 am .PERIOD
We especially emphasize areas of great relevance to Africa's development ,COMMA because ,COMMA in those areas ,COMMA scientists working in Africa will have a competitive advantage .PERIOD
They'll publish ,COMMA be invited to conferences .PERIOD
And AIMS has done extremely well .PERIOD
Five students can be educated at AIMS for the cost of educating one in the US .PERIOD or Europe .PERIOD
She communicates well with the immunologists at the hospital .PERIOD
Here are the current students at AIMS .PERIOD There are 53 of them from 20 different countries ,COMMA including 20 women .PERIOD
So now I'm going to get to my TED business .PERIOD
I want to point out a few other exceptional people in this picture .PERIOD
And she's now at AIMS .PERIOD
And our wish has two parts :COLON one is a dream and the other's a plan .PERIOD OK .PERIOD
Our TED dream is that the next Einstein will be African .PERIOD
We want to add entrepreneurship and policy skills .PERIOD
Over the last year ,COMMA we've been visiting sites in Africa ,COMMA looking at potential sites for new AIMS centers .PERIOD
So we have political support right across the continent .PERIOD
But nobody was really worried about this .PERIOD
This is a quote ,COMMA actually ,COMMA from Alan Turing :COLON In 30 years ,COMMA it will be as easy to ask a computer a question as to ask a person .PERIOD
This was in 1946 .PERIOD And now ,COMMA in 2007 ,COMMA it's still not true .PERIOD
That's how much power this computer uses .PERIOD
Rory is a graduate student at Stanford .PERIOD
I estimate 10 to the 16 bits per second ,COMMA which is actually about very similar to what Blue Gene does .PERIOD
And let me just summarize .PERIOD So the bottom line :COLON the brain processes information using 100000 times less energy than we do right now with this computer technology that we have .PERIOD
So ,COMMA this clip is from the PBS series ,COMMA The Secret Life of the Brain .PERIOD
And that's basically what's going on in your brain right now as you're watching this .PERIOD
The devices that computers use are what's called a transistor .PERIOD
Your computer uses this presence of current to represent a one ,COMMA and the absence of current to represent a zero .PERIOD
But ,COMMA when it's open ,COMMA because these ions have to line up and flow through ,COMMA one at a time ,COMMA you get a kind of sporadic ,COMMA not steady -- it's a sporadic flow of current .PERIOD
In fact ,COMMA there's about 12 electrons can all be flowing this way .PERIOD
What you see here is that there's these redundant connections .PERIOD
This is Kareem's dark eyes and that's the white background that you see here .PERIOD
So we are really duplicating the kind of signals that you have on the optic nerve .PERIOD
Let me just end by saying that this is what happens when you put Africa in a piano ,COMMA OK .PERIOD
And I had this gut reaction that this was the wrong way to do it .PERIOD
I'm interested in finding whether or not there is a really massive ,COMMA what we like to call supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy .PERIOD
But today ,COMMA the way I want you to understand a black hole ,COMMA for the proof of a black hole ,COMMA is to think of it as an object whose mass is confined to zero volume .PERIOD
So why is it so important ?QUESTIONMARK
Now ,COMMA the key here is to figure out what that Schwarzschild radius is .PERIOD
It depends only on the mass of the object .PERIOD
There are big ones .PERIOD There are little ones .PERIOD
And there are a hundred billion stars in that galaxy ,COMMA just to give you a sense of scale .PERIOD
So ,COMMA at the center there ,COMMA that's actually where most of the starlight comes out from .PERIOD
So ,COMMA you can't see the black hole itself ,COMMA but you can convert the gravitational energy of the black hole into the light we see .PERIOD
And if there is a supermassive black hole ,COMMA what we need to assume is that it's a black hole on a diet .PERIOD
And we live in the middle of it ,COMMA so when we look towards the center ,COMMA we see this plane which defines the plane of the galaxy ,COMMA or line that defines the plane of the galaxy .PERIOD
It's the gravitational pull that makes these things orbit .PERIOD
So ,COMMA this is great ,COMMA because remember my job is to show there is a lot of mass inside a small volume .PERIOD
So ,COMMA I want to see the stars that are as close to the center of the galaxy as possible .PERIOD
Because I want to show there is a mass inside as small a region as possible .PERIOD
And that buys us about a factor of 20 .PERIOD
So ,COMMA without this technology you can't see the stars .PERIOD
And this one ,COMMA this one goes around in a human lifetime .PERIOD
And the truth is ,COMMA I'm not quite there .PERIOD
But we actually have no alternative today to explaining this concentration of mass .PERIOD
Likewise ,COMMA for the young stars ,COMMA or in contrast ,COMMA the young stars ,COMMA they just should not be there .PERIOD
Using observations that are not the ones I've shown you today ,COMMA we can actually figure out which ones are old and which ones are young .PERIOD
The old ones are red .PERIOD
He didn't read a note ,COMMA and he was profoundly hearing impaired .PERIOD
And the thing about classical music ,COMMA that what and how ,COMMA it's inexhaustible .PERIOD
And a tough ,COMMA slouchy kid got up to bat ,COMMA and he took a swing and really connected .PERIOD
Brah dada dadadadah .PERIOD
And whether we call them 440 per second ,COMMA A ,COMMA or 3729 ,COMMA B flat -- trust me ,COMMA that's right -- they're just phenomena .PERIOD
And in the 17 th century ,COMMA it was more like this .PERIOD
And there began to be a real difference at this point between the art of improvisation and the art of composition .PERIOD
So in the first eight centuries or so of this tradition the big 'what' was to praise God .PERIOD
The 'how' was a style called polyphony ,COMMA music of many independently moving voices that suggested the way the planets seemed to move in Ptolemy's geocentric universe .PERIOD
Ah ,COMMA avaricious heaven !EXCLAMATIONMARK
And the chords ,COMMA it turned out ,COMMA were capable of representing incredible varieties of emotions .PERIOD
It's just these two notes in the middle .PERIOD
And it turned out the symphony could be used for more complex issues ,COMMA like gripping ones of culture ,COMMA such as nationalism or quest for freedom or the frontiers of sensuality .PERIOD
What happens when the music stops ?QUESTIONMARK
Where does it go ?QUESTIONMARK What's left ?QUESTIONMARK
It's the passing on part .PERIOD It's the 'why' part of it .PERIOD
At the same time technology ,COMMA by taking over the role that notation had always played ,COMMA shifted the balance within music between instinct and intelligence way over to the instinctive side .PERIOD
What's the long-term effect of this on us or on music ?QUESTIONMARK
Nobody knows .PERIOD
There's just a role here for so many people -- teachers ,COMMA parents ,COMMA performers -- to be explorers together .PERIOD
You can start anywhere .PERIOD Ramble a bit .PERIOD
Then these two fellows came along ,COMMA and they were flying kites to develop the control systems that would ultimately enable powered human flight .PERIOD
But unfortunately ,COMMA it relegated kites once again to be considered children's toys .PERIOD
And it doesn't hurt to do it in a location like this either .PERIOD
If you'd loan me your Gulfstream ,COMMA I'll rip its wings off and generate you a megawatt .PERIOD
The story starts with just a single person ,COMMA a child ,COMMA behaving a little strangely .PERIOD
They're creating the ecosystem from which innovation emerges .PERIOD
It's based on hundreds of hours of research ,COMMA of practice .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA here's an example -- pre-Internet -- of this machine in action .PERIOD
I mean ,COMMA you might just be a kid with a webcam ,COMMA but if you can do something that goes viral ,COMMA you get to be seen by the equivalent of sports stadiums crammed with people .PERIOD
And even if it's not that eloquent -- and it's not -- it can still really make your day .PERIOD
In fact ,COMMA my colleague ,COMMA June Cohen ,COMMA has taken to calling it radical openness ,COMMA because it works for us each time .PERIOD
By giving away our TEDx brand ,COMMA we suddenly have a thousand-plus live experiments in the art of spreading ideas .PERIOD
We're a social species .PERIOD
And that's why what I'm excited about ,COMMA and what I think is under-reported ,COMMA is the significance of the rise of online video .PERIOD
He's a unicyclist .PERIOD
Jove is a website that was founded to encourage scientists to publish their peer-reviewed research on video .PERIOD
Why do people like watching TEDTalks ?QUESTIONMARK
500 years ago ,COMMA it ran into a competitor with a lethal advantage .PERIOD
I mean ,COMMA today ,COMMA one person speaking can be seen by millions ,COMMA shedding bright light on potent ideas ,COMMA creating intense desire for learning and to respond -- and in his case ,COMMA intense desire to laugh .PERIOD
Thousands of people are figuring out new ways to learn and ,COMMA crucially ,COMMA to respond ,COMMA completing the cycle .PERIOD
And so ,COMMA as we've thought about this ,COMMA you know ,COMMA it's become clear to us what the next stage of TED's evolution has to be .PERIOD
They used the same trash to form green manure .PERIOD
Thank you .PERIOD
The name Abegg -- Abegg is actually A-B-E-G-G ,COMMA and that's the main theme in the melody .PERIOD
What I do first is ,COMMA I make a lot of little musical ideas -- you can just improvise here at the piano -- and I choose one of those to become my main theme ,COMMA my main melody ,COMMA like the Abegg that you just heard .PERIOD
So ,COMMA for inspiration I listened to Liszt and Tchaikovsky and all the great Romantic composers .PERIOD
And once I realized it ,COMMA there's a parallel between creating music and creating art ,COMMA because for your motive or your little initial idea for your drawing ,COMMA it's your character -- you want to decide who do you want to draw ,COMMA or if you want to draw an original character .PERIOD
Like ,COMMA am I going to use one page ?QUESTIONMARK
Am I going to use a two-page spread like a comic book for more grandiose effect ,COMMA I guess ?QUESTIONMARK
Instead ,COMMA I'd like to try something called improvisation .PERIOD
And that's a huge amount of data .PERIOD
And the more technical topics ,COMMA such as architecture ,COMMA materials and ,COMMA strangely enough ,COMMA men ,COMMA those are not good topics to talk about .PERIOD
Ingenious TEDTalks ,COMMA much more this green color ,COMMA etc ,COMMA et .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA since this is TEDActive ,COMMA and I learned from my analysis that I should actually give you something ,COMMA I will not impose the ultimate or worst TEDTalk on you ,COMMA but rather give you a tool to create your own .PERIOD
And I call this tool the TEDPad .PERIOD
Thank you very much .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA if you combine this very simple ,COMMA very conservative thought -- go with the grain of human nature -- with all the advances in behavioral economics ,COMMA some of which we were just hearing about ,COMMA again ,COMMA I think we can achieve a real increase in well-being ,COMMA in happiness ,COMMA in a stronger society without necessarily having to spend a whole lot more money .PERIOD
Well I can't ,COMMA in the time I've got ,COMMA give huge numbers of examples ,COMMA but let me just give a few of the ways that life can change .PERIOD
And this is so obvious ,COMMA in a way ,COMMA because you think about how all of you have changed the way we shop ,COMMA the way we travel ,COMMA the way that business is done .PERIOD
We want to get people to be more energy efficient .PERIOD
Obviously ,COMMA here we have JFK with that incredibly simple and powerful formulation ,COMMA Ask not what your country can do for you ;SEMICOLON ask what you can do for your country ,COMMA an incredibly noble sentiment .PERIOD
But when he made that speech ,COMMA what could you do to build the stronger ,COMMA better society ?QUESTIONMARK
And I think an even more wonderful speech ,COMMA which I'm going to read a big chunk of ,COMMA which sums up what I said at the beginning about believing there is more to life than money ,COMMA and more that we should try and measure than money .PERIOD
Some say up to five tons .PERIOD
They're fantastic creatures .PERIOD
So they were incredibly important animals .PERIOD
The importance of basking sharks to the coast communities is recognized through the language .PERIOD
And most of what we do know is based on their habit of coming to the surface .PERIOD
And we try to guess what they're doing from their behavior on the surface .PERIOD
And we tagged them very simply ,COMMA not very hi-tech ,COMMA with a big ,COMMA long pole .PERIOD
And of course ,COMMA sharks ,COMMA fish ,COMMA are underwater most of the time .PERIOD
And here's a couple of maps that we've done .PERIOD
That one ,COMMA you can see that we tagged both off Kerry .PERIOD
So he did another study using microsatellites ,COMMA which are much more expensive ,COMMA much more time consuming ,COMMA and ,COMMA to his surprise ,COMMA came up with almost identical results .PERIOD
And it's thought maybe it was a bottleneck ,COMMA a genetic bottleneck thought to be 12000 years ago ,COMMA and this has caused a very low diversity .PERIOD
But the average of all these studies came out -- the mean is about 5000 ,COMMA which I personally don't believe ,COMMA but then I am a skeptic .PERIOD
In fact ,COMMA of those 20000 ,COMMA 8000 were thought to be females .PERIOD
They didn't get enough samples to really explore the genetics in enough detail .PERIOD
And some are caught in nets ,COMMA in trawls .PERIOD
And in about half an hour ,COMMA we got five samples ,COMMA five individual sharks ,COMMA were sampled using Simon's shark slime sampling system .PERIOD
And I was thinking of humpback whales breaching and dolphins .PERIOD
And what you're trying to look at is the males have claspers ,COMMA which kind of dangle out behind the back of the shark .PERIOD
And you just want to learn as much as you can as soon as you can .PERIOD
Philosophers ,COMMA dramatists ,COMMA theologians have grappled with this question for centuries :COLON what makes people go wrong ?QUESTIONMARK
So when I read Robert Louis Stevenson ,COMMA that wasn't fiction .PERIOD
And apparently ,COMMA he disobeyed God ,COMMA and that's the ultimate disobedience to authority .PERIOD
I became an expert witness for one of the guards ,COMMA Sergeant Chip Frederick ,COMMA and in that position ,COMMA I had access to the dozen investigative reports .PERIOD
I had access to him .PERIOD I could study him ,COMMA have him come to my home ,COMMA get to know him ,COMMA do psychological analysis to see ,COMMA was he a good apple or bad apple .PERIOD
Why ?QUESTIONMARK Tier 1 -A was the center for military intelligence .PERIOD
That's one of the visual illustrations of evil .PERIOD
Who are the bad apples ?QUESTIONMARK Well ,COMMA that's a bad question .PERIOD
And so we're interested in ,COMMA what are the external factors around the individual -- the bad barrel ?QUESTIONMARK
And social scientists stop there ,COMMA and they miss the big point that I discovered when I became an expert witness for Abu Ghraib .PERIOD
This is Stanley Milgram ,COMMA little Jewish kid from the Bronx ,COMMA and he asked the question ,COMMA Could the Holocaust happen here ,COMMA now ?QUESTIONMARK
He gets tied up to the shock apparatus in another room .PERIOD
And so ,COMMA he's the modern Lucifer effect ,COMMA a man of God who becomes the Angel of Death .PERIOD
It was a real cop car ,COMMA it was a real policeman ,COMMA and there were real neighbors in the street ,COMMA who didn't know that this was an experiment .PERIOD
Do they kill ,COMMA torture ,COMMA mutilate ?QUESTIONMARK 13 .PERIOD
If you give people power without oversight ,COMMA it's a prescription for abuse .PERIOD They knew that ,COMMA and let that happen .PERIOD
The answer is nobody ,COMMA and ,COMMA I think ,COMMA nobody on purpose .PERIOD
Banality of heroism is ,COMMA it's ordinary people who do heroic deeds .PERIOD
He was a low-level private ,COMMA and that stopped it .PERIOD Was he a hero ?QUESTIONMARK No .PERIOD
She came down ,COMMA saw that madhouse and said ,COMMA You know what ,COMMA it's terrible what you're doing to those boys .PERIOD
So the psychology of heroism is -- we're going to end in a moment -- how do we encourage children in new hero courses ,COMMA that I'm working with Matt Langdon -- he has a hero workshop -- to develop this heroic imagination ,COMMA this self-labeling ,COMMA I am a hero in waiting ,COMMA and teach them skills .PERIOD
Wesley and the guy -- 20 and a half inches height .PERIOD
A half an inch would have taken his head off .PERIOD
Take path one ,COMMA you're going to be a perpetrator of evil .PERIOD
Path two ,COMMA you become guilty of the evil of passive inaction .PERIOD
We should ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA because without having this possibility of conscious minds ,COMMA we would have no knowledge whatsoever about our humanity ;SEMICOLON we would have no knowledge whatsoever about the world .PERIOD
So much for the wonder ,COMMA now for the mystery .PERIOD
And in that image there ,COMMA you see a variety of islands of what I call image-making regions in the brain .PERIOD
You have the green for example ,COMMA that corresponds to tactile information ,COMMA or the blue that corresponds to auditory information .PERIOD
But what about the self ?QUESTIONMARK
And for a long time ,COMMA people did not even want to touch it ,COMMA because they'd say ,COMMA How can you have this reference point ,COMMA this stability ,COMMA that is required to maintain the continuity of selves day after day ?QUESTIONMARK
I like to call it an almost infinite sameness from day to day .PERIOD
There is the brain stem in between the cerebral cortex and the spinal cord .PERIOD
It developed in collectives of human beings .PERIOD
Why care if it is the brain stem or the cerebral cortex and how this is made ?QUESTIONMARK
And if we are interested ,COMMA for example ,COMMA in the fact that anti-gravity is pulling galaxies away from the Earth ,COMMA why should we not be interested in what is going on inside of human beings ?QUESTIONMARK
When I was just a little girl ,COMMA my mom started what is now the longest-running women's film festival in the world .PERIOD
Fishnet stockings .PERIOD
I thought they were really hot .PERIOD
There are lots of very modern political movements that have caught fire in no small part because of cultural hipness .PERIOD
And one of our biggest successes is we get mail from teenage girls in the middle of Iowa who say ,COMMA I Googled Jessica Simpson and stumbled on your site .PERIOD
We don't want one face .PERIOD
Thank you .PERIOD
It's enough to make you feel very overwhelmed .PERIOD
Which brings me to my third paradox .PERIOD
You may have guessed by now ,COMMA I did not light myself on fire .PERIOD
Cornel West says ,COMMA Of course it's a failure .PERIOD
She was talking about board meetings ,COMMA she was founding peace organizations ,COMMA she was coordinating carpools ,COMMA she was consoling friends -- all these daily acts of care and creativity .PERIOD
And surely ,COMMA at three and four years old ,COMMA I was listening to the soothing sound of her voice ,COMMA but I think I was also getting my first lesson in activist work .PERIOD
Know thyself .PERIOD
And we feel like we have to get far ,COMMA far away to a secluded retreat ,COMMA leaving it all behind .PERIOD
This is the term that armies use when they've lost a battle .PERIOD
You may or may not have noticed that I'm wearing a tiny electrode on my forehead .PERIOD
Let me show you what it looks like .PERIOD
Or what if I can take that information and put it into an organic shape up on the screen ?QUESTIONMARK
I may also be interested in knowing how focused I am ,COMMA so I can put my level of attention into the circuit board on the other side .PERIOD
And that was responsiveness .PERIOD
We then realized that if technology could know something about you and use it to help you ,COMMA there's an even more valuable application than that .PERIOD
In the original Zen Bound game ,COMMA you play it by scrolling your fingers over the pad .PERIOD
You have graphs and charts that tell you how your brain was doing -- not just how much rope you used or what your high score is ,COMMA but what was going on inside of your mind .PERIOD
The way these children will be able to use their new awareness to improve themselves will upend many of the damaging and widespread social stigmas that people who are diagnosed as different are challenged with .PERIOD
Thank you .PERIOD
So I used to get my eyes tested just for fun .PERIOD
So let me just tell you ,COMMA the great part of all of this ?QUESTIONMARK
And so when I heard that eye specialist tell me all the things ,COMMA a big fat no ,COMMA everybody imagines I was devastated .PERIOD
The first thing I thought about was my mom ,COMMA who was crying over beside me .PERIOD
And that wind in my face made me believe that he was mad and I would drive .PERIOD
Oh ,COMMA for the love of God .PERIOD
I just was so -- how do I tell him ?QUESTIONMARK
And then he said to me ,COMMA What did you want to be when you were little ?QUESTIONMARK
I know this run so well ,COMMA by the back of my hand .PERIOD
I count the steps and the lampposts and all those things that visually impaired people have a tendency to have a lot of meetings with .PERIOD
And you know ,COMMA the extraordinary part of it is I just simply had no answers .PERIOD
And nobody can tell me no .PERIOD
Yes ,COMMA you can say I can't be an archeologist .PERIOD
I'm going to go across India on the back of an elephant .PERIOD
And I never thought about noes anymore ,COMMA or not seeing ,COMMA or any of that kind of nothing .PERIOD
And consequently ,COMMA we can see the result all around us .PERIOD
I hope it's not the curb cut between the Chuck E .PERIOD Cheese and the Target store because that's not good enough for Americans to be spilling their blood for .PERIOD
This is the other side of the building .PERIOD
And what is the message that is coming ,COMMA what are the vocabularies and grammars that are coming ,COMMA from this building and how is it informing us about who we are ?QUESTIONMARK
You know ,COMMA this is a building designed like a DVD player .PERIOD
Anyway ,COMMA this is how you compose and assemble a downtown business building ,COMMA and this is what happened when in Glens Falls ,COMMA New York ,COMMA when we tried to do it again ,COMMA where it was missing ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK
And that starts to be delivered in the form of the railroad suburb :COLON the country villa along the railroad line ,COMMA which allows people to enjoy the amenity of the city ,COMMA but to return to the countryside every night .PERIOD
And that's the great non-articulated agony of suburbia and one of the reasons that it lends itself to ridicule .PERIOD
I don't have any eyes on the side of my head .PERIOD I can't see .PERIOD
So they take the first one that comes along ,COMMA often .PERIOD
We're going to have to do something else instead .PERIOD
So that ,COMMA you know ,COMMA the residences make sense deployed in relation to the places of business ,COMMA of culture and of governance .PERIOD
The dead malls :COLON what are we going to do with them ?QUESTIONMARK
No amount or combination of alternative fuels is going to allow us to continue running what we're running ,COMMA the way we're running it .PERIOD
We're going to have to do everything very differently .PERIOD
And America's not prepared .PERIOD
And within that context ,COMMA we can offer the kids time -- something that seems in short supply in their over-scheduled lives .PERIOD
All materials are available for use .PERIOD
It's a great honor today to share with you The Digital Universe ,COMMA which was created for humanity to really see where we are in the universe .PERIOD
NASA supported this work 12 years ago as part of the rebuilding of the Hayden Planetarium so that we would share this with the world .PERIOD
I captured this live from my laptop in a cafe called Earth Matters on the Lower East Side of Manhattan ,COMMA where I live ,COMMA and it was done as a collaborative project with the Rubin Museum of Himalayan Art for an exhibit on comparative cosmology .PERIOD
But this our containment of the visible universe .PERIOD
This map can be updated ,COMMA and we can add in new data .PERIOD
We have a growing user base of this ,COMMA and we network domes .PERIOD
So you're seeing the edge of the Earth .PERIOD
This is Nepal and Tibet .PERIOD
Thank you .PERIOD
So ,COMMA he figures out a way to download himself into his environment ,COMMA actually into a series of books .PERIOD
I think that this is the future of interface ,COMMA it's the future of music ,COMMA the future of instruments .PERIOD
And I'll let Adam tell you .PERIOD So ,COMMA Adam is a PhD .PERIOD student at MIT ,COMMA an expert in music technology and medicine .PERIOD And Adam and Dan have become close collaborators .PERIOD
Adam Boulanger :COLON Yes .PERIOD So ,COMMA Tod and I entered into a discussion following the Tewksbury work and it was really about how Dan is an expressive person ,COMMA and he's an intelligent and creative person .PERIOD And it's in his face ,COMMA it's in his breathing ,COMMA it's in his eyes .PERIOD How come he can't perform one of his pieces of music ?QUESTIONMARK That's our responsibility ,COMMA and it doesn't make sense .PERIOD
But what about expression ?QUESTIONMARK What about that moment when an artist delivers that piece of work ?QUESTIONMARK You know ,COMMA do our technologies allow us to express ?QUESTIONMARK
So let's do it .PERIOD So Dan do you want to tell everyone about what you're going to play now ?QUESTIONMARK
So he can go in Hyperscore .PERIOD You start out by making melodies and rhythms .PERIOD
He can place those exactly where he wants .PERIOD
But instead of making it very literal ,COMMA showing you exactly the camera tracing ,COMMA we turned it into a graphic that shows you the basic movement ,COMMA and shows the way it's being analyzed .PERIOD
Yeah .PERIOD
And these women sing an enchanting song ,COMMA a song so alluring that all sailors who hear it crash into the rocks and die .PERIOD
I want to hear that song .PERIOD Untie me .PERIOD
There is first ,COMMA the present self .PERIOD
Well resisting temptation is hard ,COMMA as the 19 th century English economist Nassau William Senior said ,COMMA To abstain from the enjoyment which is in our power ,COMMA or to seek distant rather than immediate results ,COMMA are among the most painful exertions of the human will .PERIOD
So the first is ,COMMA when you've got one of these devices going ,COMMA such as this contract to write everyday or pay ,COMMA it's just a constant reminder that you have no self-control .PERIOD
The other problem with commitment devices is that you can always weasel your way out of them .PERIOD
And this is a timely issue .PERIOD
And we're at a situation now where for every three baby boomers ,COMMA the McKinsey Global Institute predicts that two will not be able to meet their pre-retirement needs while they're in retirement .PERIOD
He said that ,COMMA We might neglect our future selves because of some failure of belief or imagination .PERIOD
When you make an investment ,COMMA what you're really saying is ,COMMA I accept that any one of these 100 things could happen to me and determine my wealth .PERIOD
Once you find an investment that you're happy with ,COMMA what people do is they click done and the markers begin to disappear ,COMMA slowly ,COMMA one by one .PERIOD
If you save very little ,COMMA the future self is unhappy living on 44 percent of the income .PERIOD
And what's nice about it is it's not something that biasing people actually ,COMMA because as one face smiles ,COMMA the other face frowns .PERIOD
There are programs you can get to see how people might look if they smoke ,COMMA if they get too much exposure to the sun ,COMMA if they gain weight and so on .PERIOD
Hal is here ,COMMA so I think we owe it to him as well as yourself to disabuse you of that last image .PERIOD
I began my life as a markets professional and continued to take an interest ,COMMA but most of my recent effort has been looking at the value of what comes to human beings from nature ,COMMA and which doesn't get priced by the markets .PERIOD
And the answer is :COLON Yeah ,COMMA it can .PERIOD
Biodiversity ,COMMA the living fabric of this planet ,COMMA is not a gas .PERIOD
And if you look at the species level ,COMMA you saw about fish .PERIOD
And at this rate at which we are losing fish ,COMMA it is a human problem of enormous dimensions ,COMMA a health problem of a kind we haven't seen before .PERIOD
The green represents the percentage .PERIOD
The reason this is happening boils down ,COMMA in my mind ,COMMA to one basic problem ,COMMA which is our inability to perceive the difference between public benefits and private profits .PERIOD
We tend to constantly ignore public wealth simply because it is in the common wealth ,COMMA it's common goods .PERIOD
It causes pollutants being issued ,COMMA which have an economic cost ,COMMA health cost and so on .PERIOD
When we measure GDP as a measure of economic performance at the national level ,COMMA we don't include our biggest asset at the country level .PERIOD
When we measure corporate performances ,COMMA we don't include our impacts on nature and what our business costs society .PERIOD
That has to stop .PERIOD
So clearly there was a problem with deforestation .PERIOD
And I couldn't answer because neither of these companies ,COMMA good though they are and professional though they are ,COMMA do not calculate or disclose their externalities .PERIOD
That's an example ,COMMA I think ,COMMA for us to look at and for us to draw comfort from .PERIOD
If more companies did this ,COMMA and if more sectors engaged this as sectors ,COMMA you could have analysts ,COMMA business analysts ,COMMA and you could have people like us and consumers and NGOs actually look and compare the social performance of companies .PERIOD
has already set up a coalition to do this ,COMMA an international coalition .PERIOD
A bit like inflation :COLON you over-issue currency ,COMMA you get what you see ,COMMA declining prices .PERIOD
So in selecting targets of 450 parts per million and selecting two degrees at the climate negotiations ,COMMA what we have done is we've made an ethical choice .PERIOD
I decided when I was asked to do this that what I really wanted to talk about was my friend Richard Feynman .PERIOD
Richard Feynman was a very complex man .PERIOD
He was a man of many ,COMMA many parts .PERIOD
It may still exist ;SEMICOLON I don't know .PERIOD
But it was really brutal .PERIOD
But the amazing thing was -- Feynman had to leave a little early .PERIOD
Sometimes I would win ,COMMA mostly he would win ,COMMA but we both enjoyed them .PERIOD
And he said ,COMMA Leonardo ,COMMA were you closer to your mother or to you father when you were a kid ?QUESTIONMARK
Being Dick ,COMMA he ,COMMA of course ,COMMA wanted to check this .PERIOD
There went that theory down the trashcan of history .PERIOD
But let me tell you a little bit about Feynman the physicist .PERIOD
He would try to visualize it ,COMMA guided by a small number of simple principles .PERIOD
It was so simple ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA that I suspect a really smart high school student ,COMMA who didn't even have calculus ,COMMA could understand what he wrote down .PERIOD
You simply take the proton ,COMMA and you hit it really sharply with an electron .PERIOD
So I think I'll just finish up by saying I actually don't think Feynman would have liked this event .PERIOD
Thank you .PERIOD
When this trailer showed up at my shop in Berkeley ,COMMA I'd actually never stepped foot in an Airstream trailer ,COMMA or any other trailer .PERIOD
I decided I had to do some research and really figure out what had gone wrong somewhere along the history of Airstream .PERIOD
There's no such things as two walls and a ceiling coming together ,COMMA where you can change materials and shapes .PERIOD
That's the trailer ,COMMA pretty much finished .PERIOD
I thought ,COMMA Finally ,COMMA oh yeah great ,COMMA big company ,COMMA I'm gonna work with somebody with money for tooling and molding .PERIOD
Welcome to Five Dangerous Things You Should Let Your Children Do .PERIOD
We put warnings on coffee cups to tell us that the contents may be hot .PERIOD
So where does this trend stop ?QUESTIONMARK
And yeah ,COMMA they're going to cut themselves .PERIOD
So practicing throwing things has been shown to stimulate the frontal and parietal lobes ,COMMA which have to do with visual acuity ,COMMA 3 D understanding ,COMMA and structural problem solving ,COMMA so it gives a sense -- it helps develop their visualization skills and their predictive ability .PERIOD
Number four -- deconstruct appliances .PERIOD
And it's fun for the whole family .PERIOD
Narrator :COLON We are all aware of the risk of cancer ,COMMA but there's another disease that's destined to affect even more of us :COLON arthritis .PERIOD
This is the field of biologic replacements ,COMMA where we replace worn-out parts with new ,COMMA natural ones .PERIOD
And it works ,COMMA not just for my wife ,COMMA but certainly for other patients .PERIOD
And so that's not going to be a solution that's going to get us global with biologic tissue .PERIOD
How are we going to revolutionize artificial joint replacement ?QUESTIONMARK
The space age began 50 years ago in October ,COMMA and that’s exactly what Sputnik looked like .PERIOD
They would bring them back and mount them .PERIOD
So that’s for fun .PERIOD
You can see how portable and handy it was to have your own Guttenberg in 1455 .PERIOD
In 1455 ,COMMA nobody could read .PERIOD
But why is this so interesting ?QUESTIONMARK Here’s the quick story .PERIOD
That is why the printing press succeeded ,COMMA and that is why Martin Luther nailed his 90 theses to the door :COLON because he was complaining that the Catholic Church had gone amok in printing out indulgences and selling them in every town and village and city in all of Western Europe .PERIOD
Instead of showing an object from the stage I’m going to do something special for the first time .PERIOD
We are going to show ,COMMA actually ,COMMA what the library looks like ,COMMA OK ?QUESTIONMARK
And all throughout the library are different objects ,COMMA different spaces .PERIOD
And yet ,COMMA looking at them ,COMMA you would see a machine and a molecule .PERIOD
And what does a lump of coal have to do with the Internet ?QUESTIONMARK
What that means is ,COMMA a 200 -megabyte file looks like this ,COMMA ladies and gentlemen .PERIOD OK ?QUESTIONMARK
The ego is not supposed to be involved in graphic design .PERIOD
So then I can add some color in with the background and add a bit more color in with the words themselves ,COMMA and this way ,COMMA working with the art director ,COMMA I'm able to bring it to just the right point that it's puzzling for the audience -- they can figure out that there's something they have to read -- but it's not impossible for them to read .PERIOD
So I'm currently working on a book ,COMMA which plays with both senses of the word ,COMMA as I explore some of my own ideas and inquiries in a visual display of rather peacock-like grandeur .PERIOD
I've been sending out valentines on a fairly large scale since 2005 .PERIOD
There's a longer story to this ,COMMA but I did get them all done in time ,COMMA and they were extremely well received .PERIOD
I got an almost 100 percent response rate .PERIOD
I had this idea that I wanted people to receive a kind of mysterious love letter ,COMMA like a found fragment in their mailbox .PERIOD
And I specifically wrote four pages that don't connect .PERIOD
I'm certain I can see you blushing .PERIOD
So I solicited friends to send me their used Christmas cards ,COMMA and I made 500 of these .PERIOD
What does it say ?QUESTIONMARK
So that's why I do what I do ,COMMA and why I spend so much time and effort on it ,COMMA and why I work in the commercial ,COMMA public sphere ,COMMA as opposed to the isolated ,COMMA private sphere of fine art :COLON because I want as many people as possible to see my work ,COMMA notice it ,COMMA be drawn into it ,COMMA and be able to take something from it .PERIOD
And I actually really feel that it's worthwhile to spend my valuable and limited time on this Earth in this way .PERIOD
And I thank you for allowing me to show it to you .PERIOD
The main characteristics of such a system is that there's one sole contact point to the ground .PERIOD
He's now keeping a constant distance to Thomas .PERIOD
And of course ,COMMA who wouldn't like to take a ride on one of these .PERIOD
And I say ,COMMA What is the light bulb good for ?QUESTIONMARK
Even when you're standing in front of a megaphone ,COMMA it's pretty much every direction .PERIOD
I got this waterfall I recorded in my back yard .PERIOD
You have to be kind of smart ,COMMA and though I did not graduate from college doesn't mean I'm stupid ,COMMA because you cannot be stupid and do very much in the world today .PERIOD
We're just starting to really discover the laws of nature and science and physics .PERIOD
I have been really lucky with this technology :COLON all of a sudden as it is ready ,COMMA the world is ready to accept it .PERIOD
This unit that I played goes from about 200 hertz to above the range of hearing .PERIOD
It's actually emitting ultrasound -- low-level ultrasound -- that's about 100000 vibrations per second .PERIOD
And the sound that you're hearing ,COMMA unlike a regular speaker on which all the sound is made on the face ,COMMA is made out in front of it ,COMMA in the air .PERIOD
Or you can whisper in the ear of a supposed terrorist some Biblical verse .PERIOD
We put it on a turret with a camera ,COMMA so that when they shoot at you ,COMMA you're over there ,COMMA and it's there .PERIOD
I took it back to the Pentagon after it got declassified ,COMMA when the patent issued ,COMMA and told the people back there about it ,COMMA and they laughed ,COMMA and then I took them back a demo and they bought .PERIOD
So ,COMMA I've been really lucky as an inventor .PERIOD
I've got a Coke can opening that's right in your head ;SEMICOLON that's really cool .PERIOD
Appreciate it very much .PERIOD
I thought I would talk a little bit about how nature makes materials .PERIOD
I've been fascinated by how nature makes materials ,COMMA and there's a lot of sequence to how they do such an exquisite job .PERIOD
So that's the vision that I've been thinking about .PERIOD
There's diatoms made out of SIO 2 ,COMMA and they're magnetotactic bacteria that make small ,COMMA single-domain magnets used for navigation .PERIOD
And I was really fortunate to have President Obama visit my lab this year on his visit to MIT ,COMMA and I really wanted to give him a periodic table .PERIOD
What if he says ,COMMA 'Oh ,COMMA I already have one' or ,COMMA 'I've already memorized it' ?QUESTIONMARK
Now if you take all billion viruses ,COMMA and you can put them in one drop of liquid ,COMMA you can force them to interact with anything you want on the periodic table .PERIOD
So basically ,COMMA viruses can't replicate themselves ;SEMICOLON they need a host .PERIOD
And so through a process of selection evolution ,COMMA we went from being able to have a virus that made a crummy battery to a virus that made a good battery to a virus that made a record-breaking ,COMMA high-powered battery that's all made at room temperature ,COMMA basically at the bench top .PERIOD
You can make lots of amplifications to it .PERIOD
When you shine light on them ,COMMA you can see them bubbling .PERIOD
In this case ,COMMA you're seeing oxygen bubbles come out .PERIOD
The last example are solar cells .PERIOD
And what we've found is through genetic engineering ,COMMA we can actually increase the efficiencies of these solar cells to record numbers for these types of dye-sensitized systems .PERIOD
I'll hear things like an extra room in the house ,COMMA the basement ,COMMA the coffee shop ,COMMA the library .PERIOD
And then you'll hear things like the train ,COMMA a plane ,COMMA a car -- so ,COMMA the commute .PERIOD
Why is that happening ?QUESTIONMARK
You don't have a workday anymore .PERIOD You have work moments .PERIOD
It's like the front door of the office is like a Cuisinart ,COMMA and you walk in and your day is shredded to bits ,COMMA because you have 15 minutes here and 30 minutes there ,COMMA and then something else happens and you're pulled off your work ,COMMA and you've got to do something else ,COMMA then you have 20 minutes ,COMMA then it's lunch .PERIOD
I sat at my desk .PERIOD I used my expensive computer .PERIOD
You might have a quick idea ,COMMA but to be in deep thought about a problem and really consider a problem carefully ,COMMA you need long stretches of uninterrupted time .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA there are different kinds of distractions ,COMMA but there aren't the really bad kinds of distractions that I'll talk about in just a minute .PERIOD
So sleep is about sleep phases ,COMMA or stages -- some people call them different things .PERIOD
If you're interrupted and woken up ,COMMA you have to start again .PERIOD
I don't think anyone would say yes .PERIOD
They'll also say -- sometimes they'll also say ,COMMA Well ,COMMA if I can't see the person ,COMMA how do I know they're working ?QUESTIONMARK
which is ridiculous ,COMMA of course ,COMMA but that's one of the excuses that managers give .PERIOD
No one cared about letting people take a smoke break for 15 minutes 10 years ago ,COMMA so why does everyone care about someone going to Facebook here and there ,COMMA or Twitter here and there ,COMMA or YouTube here and there ?QUESTIONMARK
Those are the real problems in the modern office today .PERIOD
That's kind of bad .PERIOD
And meetings are just toxic ,COMMA terrible ,COMMA poisonous things during the day at work .PERIOD
What if they're doing important work ?QUESTIONMARK
If there are 10 people in the meeting ,COMMA it's a 10 -hour meeting ;SEMICOLON it's not a one-hour meeting .PERIOD
It's 10 hours of productivity taken from the rest of the organization to have this one one-hour meeting ,COMMA which probably should have been handled by two or three people talking for a few minutes .PERIOD
These things don't exist outside of the office .PERIOD
I have about three minutes ,COMMA so that'll fit perfectly .PERIOD
I don't know if people still do that .PERIOD
So just the afternoon ,COMMA one Thursday .PERIOD
This is when people actually get stuff done ,COMMA is when no one's bothering them ,COMMA when no one's interrupting them .PERIOD
All these discussions and decisions you thought you had to make at this one time at 9 am .PERIOD on Monday ,COMMA just forget about them ,COMMA and things will be just fine .PERIOD
And I specialize in human behavioral research ,COMMA and applying what we learn to think about the future in different ways ,COMMA and to design for that future .PERIOD
And it'll take about another two years to connect the next billion after that .PERIOD
So this is interesting to us ,COMMA because the conscious and subconscious decision process implies that the stuff that you do take with you and end up using has some kind of spiritual ,COMMA emotional or functional value .PERIOD
But if you ask people what the three most important things that they carry are -- across cultures and across gender and across contexts -- most people will say keys ,COMMA money and ,COMMA if they own one ,COMMA a mobile phone .PERIOD
And a mobile phone ,COMMA it turns out ,COMMA is a great recovery tool .PERIOD
But -- and it's a pretty big but -- we forget .PERIOD
I think ,COMMA quite a nice feature .PERIOD
And these things don't stay in the center of gravity ,COMMA but over time ,COMMA they gravitate there .PERIOD
But the difference between this and that is ,COMMA there's no central authority trying to control this .PERIOD
And OK ,COMMA if you break one of these things here ,COMMA you return it to the carrier .PERIOD
They'll probably give you three new ones ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK
It challenges the norms .PERIOD
This is how it's shifting .PERIOD
I'm just the messenger .PERIOD
And companies like Navigenics and DNA Direct and 23 andMe ,COMMA that are giving you your genetic profiles ,COMMA are giving some people a sense of ,COMMA Gosh ,COMMA well ,COMMA what can I do about it ?QUESTIONMARK
And so my request is ,COMMA please ,COMMA let's make technologies that make people more human ,COMMA and not less .PERIOD
I made a lot of mistakes and dumb decisions ,COMMA of course .PERIOD
So let's say for instance that you're on your way to your best friend's wedding and you're trying to get to the airport and you're stuck in terrible traffic ,COMMA and you finally arrive at your gate and you've missed your flight .PERIOD
We wish we'd taken better advantage of the education that we did have .PERIOD
Odds are ,COMMA you're not going to care in five years .PERIOD
It feels terrible .PERIOD Regret feels awful .PERIOD
And the thought was ,COMMA Make it go away !EXCLAMATIONMARK
We just want it to vanish .PERIOD
Make it go away .PERIOD Make it go away .PERIOD
In point of fact ,COMMA no insurance covers acts of idiocy .PERIOD
And the problem is that there are certain things that happen in life that we desperately want to change and we cannot .PERIOD
But first I want to say that the intensity and persistence with which we experience these emotional components of regret is obviously going to vary depending on the specific thing that we're feeling regretful about .PERIOD
The FDA estimates that of all the Americans who have tattoos ,COMMA 17 percent of us regret getting them .PERIOD
Now in my case ,COMMA this really wasn't a problem ,COMMA because it's actually very easy to laugh at yourself when you're 29 years old and you want your mommy because you don't like your new tattoo .PERIOD
All right .PERIOD
And what I loved about this image of the compass was that I felt like it encapsulated both of these ideas in one simple image .PERIOD
Even in wealthy countries it is common now to see inequality growing .PERIOD
In the United States ,COMMA since 2001 we've had five years of economic growth ,COMMA five years of productivity growth in the workplace ,COMMA but median wages are stagnant and the percentage of working families dropping below the poverty line is up by four percent .PERIOD
It is also unstable .PERIOD
Because primarily of the power of the Internet ,COMMA people of modest means can band together and amass vast sums of money that can change the world for some public good if they all agree .PERIOD
You saw one reference to that in what we were able to do with AIDS drugs .PERIOD
When I got out of office and was asked to work ,COMMA first in the Caribbean ,COMMA to try to help deal with the AIDS crisis ,COMMA generic drugs were available for about 500 dollars a person a year .PERIOD
We need a movie on those six categories .PERIOD
And all of you need to have it embedded in your brains and to organize yourselves around it .PERIOD
You think about whatever your life has been ,COMMA however many obstacles you have faced in your life ,COMMA at critical junctures you always knew there was a predictable connection between the effort you exerted and the result you achieved .PERIOD
As poor as Haiti is ,COMMA in the area where Farmer's clinic is active -- and they serve a catchment area far greater than the medical professionals they have would indicate they could serve -- since 1988 ,COMMA they have not lost one person to tuberculosis ,COMMA not one .PERIOD
We're essentially implementing what Paul Farmer did in Haiti :COLON he develops and trains paid community health workers who are able to identify health problems ,COMMA ensure that people who have AIDS or TB are properly diagnosed and take their medicine regularly ,COMMA who work on bringing about health education ,COMMA clean water and sanitation ,COMMA providing nutritional supplements and moving people up the chain of health care if they have problems of the severity that require it .PERIOD
The procedures that make this work have been perfected ,COMMA as I said ,COMMA by Paul Farmer and his team in their work in rural Haiti over the last 20 years .PERIOD
And the results were so good that the Rwandan government has now agreed to adopt the model for the entire country ,COMMA and has strongly supported and put the full resources of the government behind it .PERIOD
And then we have others working in these other related programs .PERIOD
So she now works full-time on this for very little pay .PERIOD
And not a single soul in this area was being treated for AIDS or tuberculosis .PERIOD
Listen to this :COLON less than four-tenths of one percent of those being treated stopped taking their medicine or otherwise defaulted on treatment .PERIOD
We're now working with Partners in Health and the Ministry of Health in Rwanda and our Foundation folks to scale this system up .PERIOD
We need initial upfront investment to train doctors ,COMMA nurses ,COMMA health administration and community health workers throughout the country ,COMMA to set up the information technology ,COMMA the solar energy ,COMMA the water and sanitation ,COMMA the transportation infrastructure .PERIOD
I had a really hard time in school .PERIOD
In fact ,COMMA my mother told me eventually that I was the little kid in the village who cried all the way to school .PERIOD
I ran away .PERIOD
And when the natural breeze isn't enough ,COMMA the kids deploy bubbles ,COMMA but not the kind of bubbles you know .PERIOD
They know they can control their world .PERIOD
Landscaping .PERIOD
They're part of the rice cycle and these skills will be valuable for them in their future .PERIOD
The food is incredible .PERIOD
Green School is a place of pioneers ,COMMA local and global .PERIOD
The kids are from 25 countries .PERIOD
You practice ancient Balinese arts .PERIOD
The kids love it .PERIOD
And together these volunteers and the teachers are deeply committed to creating a new generation of global ,COMMA green leaders .PERIOD
The Green School effect -- we don't know what it is .PERIOD
And how did we do all this ?QUESTIONMARK
It's a double helix .PERIOD
From the time the foundations were finished ,COMMA in three months it had roofs and floors .PERIOD
You ruined my life ,COMMA but you gave me an incredible future .PERIOD
And then a third attempt ,COMMA which also patched me back together pretty well ,COMMA until it failed .PERIOD
I tried out various computer voices that were available online ,COMMA and for several months I had a British accent ,COMMA which Chaz called Sir Lawrence .PERIOD
There are all sorts of html codes you can use to control the timing and inflection of computer voices ,COMMA and I've experimented with them .PERIOD
But what value do we place on the sound of our own voice ?QUESTIONMARK
But it wasn't that simple .PERIOD
or Roger 20 .PERIOD
This is the first version of my computer voice .PERIOD
When I read something ,COMMA it will read in my voice .PERIOD
The voice was created by a company in Scotland named CereProc .PERIOD
I plan to use it on television ,COMMA radio and the Internet .PERIOD
People who need a voice should know that most computers already come with built-in speaking systems .PERIOD
John Hunter :COLON All my life I was a motormouth .PERIOD
I doubt ,COMMA on that day 50 years ago ,COMMA they even dreamed of what Salman Khan has accomplished .PERIOD
But that's not the point .PERIOD
I have learned from Wikipedia that ,COMMA starting with that humble beginning ,COMMA PLATO established forums ,COMMA message boards ,COMMA online testing ,COMMA email ,COMMA chat rooms ,COMMA picture languages ,COMMA instant messaging ,COMMA remote screen sharing and multiple-player games .PERIOD
But online ,COMMA everybody speaks at the same speed .PERIOD
Ironic that my legs are fine ,COMMA and it's my shoulders that slow up my walk .PERIOD
When you see me today ,COMMA I look like the Phantom of the Opera .PERIOD
I’d like to dedicate this one to all the women in South Africa -- those women who refused to dwindle in the midst of apartheid .PERIOD

Let me tell you my story .PERIOD
I came to London ,COMMA and I've seen performance by Cirque du Soleil .PERIOD
I wanted my artistic statement ,COMMA my interpretation of reality .PERIOD
The secret is that we were treating the whole newspaper as one piece ,COMMA as one composition -- like music .PERIOD
And design is responsible for this experience .PERIOD
What really makes it amazing :COLON that the circulation of these newspapers were growing too .PERIOD
Same in Poland :COLON plus 13 ,COMMA up to 35 percent raise of circulation after three years .PERIOD
You can work for a small company ,COMMA in a boring branch .PERIOD
So bear with me as I take you through this journey .PERIOD
I was running across the street ,COMMA and the only thing that I actually remember is feeling like a grenade went off in my head .PERIOD
And I remember putting my hands on the ground and feeling my life's blood emptying out of my neck and my mouth .PERIOD
I had no idea what was going on ,COMMA but strangers intervened ,COMMA kept my heart moving ,COMMA beating .PERIOD
I had lots of titanium put in me ,COMMA cadaver bones to try to get my feet moving the right way .PERIOD
And I needed that wisdom at that moment in my life .PERIOD
So they eventually started matching their talents and skills to all of my needs .PERIOD
So they figured not being able to see is one thing ,COMMA but they need to get me to talk .PERIOD
The redundancy was actually good for me .PERIOD
So everything is different when you're a sighted person because you take that for granted .PERIOD
We didn't have words like crowd-sourcing and radical collaboration when I had my accident .PERIOD
A peasant ,COMMA who was walking to market that morning ,COMMA ran towards where the gunshot had come from ,COMMA and found a young man writhing in agony on the floor ,COMMA clearly shot by a dueling wound .PERIOD
Galois was taken to the local hospital where he died the next day in the arms of his brother .PERIOD
And the last words he said to his brother were ,COMMA Don't cry for me ,COMMA Alfred .PERIOD
But a few years earlier ,COMMA while still at school ,COMMA he'd actually cracked one of the big mathematical problems at the time .PERIOD
Symmetry can also help us to explain what's happening in the Large Hadron Collider in CERN .PERIOD
Artists too love to play around with symmetry .PERIOD
Here is Thomas Mann talking about symmetry in The Magic Mountain .PERIOD
And the gateway you see behind has eight columns ,COMMA with beautiful symmetrical designs on them .PERIOD
And I said to Professor Kurokawa ,COMMA Wow ,COMMA the architects must have really been kicking themselves when they realized that they'd made a mistake and put this one upside down .PERIOD
Recently I took my family -- we do these rather kind of nerdy mathematical trips ,COMMA which my family love .PERIOD
I think one of the problems about school mathematics is it doesn't look at how mathematics is embedded in the world we live in .PERIOD
So they explored a more geometric art .PERIOD
And the power of mathematics is often to change one thing into another ,COMMA to change geometry into language .PERIOD
Actually ,COMMA the invention of the number zero was a very modern concept ,COMMA seventh century AD ,COMMA by the Indians .PERIOD
I can reflect it in the line through X ,COMMA or the line through Y ,COMMA or the line through Z .PERIOD
So both of these objects have six symmetries .PERIOD
So the little table here records how the algebra of these symmetries work .PERIOD
And this enables us to distinguish why the symmetries of these objects -- they both have six symmetries .PERIOD So why shouldn't we say they have the same symmetries ?QUESTIONMARK
And ,COMMA using those rules ,COMMA he was able to say that there are in fact only two objects with six symmetries .PERIOD
And all the tiles match up again .PERIOD
So ,COMMA there was a sixth of a turn .PERIOD A third of a turn where the Z pieces meet .PERIOD
How many symmetries does a Rubik's Cube have ?QUESTIONMARK
Rather than you all shouting out ,COMMA I want you to count how many digits there are in that number .PERIOD Okay ?QUESTIONMARK
Because this one .PERIOD I think there were a few here .PERIOD
The people who just last sat down .PERIOD
And I'd like to review just how unintended consequences play the part that they do .PERIOD
But he did his best ,COMMA and he kept meticulous records that let him transform that branch of medicine .PERIOD
So there were benefits in calamities -- benefits to pure science ,COMMA as well as to applied science and medicine .PERIOD
There are two historians of business at the University of Maryland ,COMMA Brent Goldfarb and David Kirsch ,COMMA who have done some extremely interesting work ,COMMA much of it still unpublished ,COMMA on the history of major innovations .PERIOD
They have combined the list of major innovations ,COMMA and they've discovered that the greatest number ,COMMA the greatest decade ,COMMA for fundamental innovations ,COMMA as reflected in all of the lists that others have made -- a number of lists that they have merged -- was the Great Depression .PERIOD
So we see that sometimes ,COMMA as a result of these dislocations ,COMMA as a result of people leaving their original intended career and going into something else where their creativity could make a difference ,COMMA that depressions and all kinds of other unfortunate events can have a paradoxically stimulating effect on creativity .PERIOD
We need to see what they can do for us .PERIOD
It's kind of like a new approach to desktop computing .PERIOD
And some of those we wanted to transfer to the icons in our system .PERIOD
Also just like paper ,COMMA around our workspace we'll pin things up to the wall to remember them later ,COMMA and I can do the same thing here ,COMMA and you know ,COMMA you'll see post-it notes and things like that around people's offices .PERIOD
So one thing we have for that is like a grid align ,COMMA kind of -- so you get that more traditional desktop .PERIOD Things are kind of grid aligned .PERIOD
The photo was made when we were deep in the valley over there .PERIOD
But I think the point is that this is metaphor with teeth ,COMMA and it's with those teeth that I want to propose today that we rethink a little bit about the role of contemporary math -- not just financial math ,COMMA but math in general .PERIOD
And he said ,COMMA It's funny you ask that ,COMMA because it's actually called black box trading .PERIOD
There's a company in Boston called Nanex ,COMMA and they use math and magic and I don't know what ,COMMA and they reach into all the market data and they find ,COMMA actually sometimes ,COMMA some of these algorithms .PERIOD
And when they find them they pull them out and they pin them to the wall like butterflies .PERIOD
Pragmatic Chaos is ,COMMA like all of Netflix algorithms ,COMMA trying to do the same thing .PERIOD
Pragmatic Chaos ,COMMA like all Netflix algorithms ,COMMA determines ,COMMA in the end ,COMMA 60 percent of what movies end up being rented .PERIOD
Wouldn't that be handy ?QUESTIONMARK
And it uses what's called a bin-packing algorithm .PERIOD
And this is really where the wires come right up into the city .PERIOD
But before I dive into those I want to admit that I am an optimist .PERIOD
And part of the reason I feel that way is looking at the past .PERIOD
Another statistic ,COMMA perhaps my favorite ,COMMA is to look at childhood deaths .PERIOD
The next breakthrough is to cut that 10 million in half again .PERIOD
Why ?QUESTIONMARK Well there's only a few diseases that account for the vast majority of those deaths :COLON diarrhea ,COMMA pneumonia and malaria .PERIOD
And the disease was all over the world .PERIOD
And two tools helped bring the death rate down .PERIOD
But ,COMMA malaria -- even the million deaths a year caused by malaria greatly understate its impact .PERIOD
Over 200 million people at any one time are suffering from it .PERIOD
And bed nets are a great tool .PERIOD
So every tool that we've ever had in the past has eventually become ineffective .PERIOD
It involves communicators to keep the funding high ,COMMA to keep the visibility high ,COMMA to tell the success stories .PERIOD
It involves social scientists ,COMMA so we know how to get not just 70 percent of the people to use the bed nets ,COMMA but 90 percent .PERIOD
It seems like the kind of question that people would spend a lot of time on ,COMMA and we'd understand very well .PERIOD
Let's start with why this is important .PERIOD
Not only has that been weak .PERIOD it's getting weaker .PERIOD
And the answer is no .PERIOD
But it in no way is associated with being a better teacher .PERIOD
They have 66 schools -- mostly middle schools ,COMMA some high schools -- and what goes on is great teaching .PERIOD
If you have a kid who's behind ,COMMA you would know you could assign them that video to watch and review the concept .PERIOD
I'm going to send everyone here a free copy of this book .PERIOD
I only have three minutes so I'm going to have to talk fast ,COMMA and it will use up your spare mental cycles ,COMMA so multitasking may be hard .PERIOD
So ,COMMA it's logical that you'd have one there ,COMMA on the minor road entering the major .PERIOD
And so ,COMMA the question is ,COMMA what does that cost us ?QUESTIONMARK
That's just the gasoline cost .PERIOD There is also pollution ,COMMA wear on the car ,COMMA and time .PERIOD
Discount that back to the present ,COMMA at five percent :COLON over two million dollars for a stop sign ,COMMA in each direction .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA if you look at what that adjacent property is worth ,COMMA you could actually buy the property ,COMMA cut down the shrubbery to improve the sight line ,COMMA and then sell it off again .PERIOD
And because we no longer need to use sunlight ,COMMA we have very specialized lights that are made for the operating room .PERIOD
And this is what I think is the magic of fluorescence .PERIOD
That's what the surgeon is saying in the operating room when the patient's on the table .PERIOD
But then we actually don't know that it's all out .PERIOD
And we wait .PERIOD
So now you're faced with telling your patient ,COMMA first of all ,COMMA that they may need another surgery ,COMMA or that they need additional therapy such as radiation or chemotherapy .PERIOD
So even if the tumor is not right on the surface ,COMMA you'll still be able to see it .PERIOD
So if you're driving on the freeway and you want to know where's the next gas station ,COMMA you have a map to tell you that that gas station is down the road .PERIOD
So with our technology ,COMMA we can tell right away .PERIOD
Nerves ,COMMA if they are injured ,COMMA can cause paralysis ,COMMA can cause pain .PERIOD
But you know what ,COMMA these little nerves are so small ,COMMA in the context of prostate cancer ,COMMA that they are actually never seen .PERIOD
People said ,COMMA We've been doing it this way for all these years .PERIOD
But I went ahead anyway .PERIOD
We have been able to see nerves for facial expression ,COMMA for facial movement ,COMMA for breathing -- every single nerve -- nerves for urinary function around the prostate .PERIOD
I have patients who would benefit from this .PERIOD
I think that this will result in my surgeries with a better outcome and fewer complications .PERIOD
And this takes the long-term steady courage of the day-in day-out struggle to educate ,COMMA to persuade and to win acceptance .PERIOD
And that is the light that I want to shine on health and medicine today .PERIOD
They receive input from thousands of upstream partners and compute their own electrical outputs ,COMMA which then ,COMMA if they pass a certain threshold ,COMMA will go to thousands of downstream partners .PERIOD
If we could activate cells ,COMMA we could see what powers they can unleash ,COMMA what they can initiate and sustain .PERIOD
Now in the 20 th century ,COMMA there was some hope that was generated through the development of pharmaceuticals for treating brain disorders ,COMMA and while many drugs have been developed that can alleviate symptoms of brain disorders ,COMMA practically none of them can be considered to be cured .PERIOD
There's one other magic trick you need to make this all happen ,COMMA and that's the ability to get light into the brain .PERIOD
So how do we do this ?QUESTIONMARK
And one of the things that we did was to adopt a very classical model of fear .PERIOD
And over time -- in this case ,COMMA a mouse ,COMMA which is a good animal model ,COMMA commonly used in such experiments -- the animal learns to fear the tone .PERIOD
The animal will react by freezing ,COMMA sort of like a deer in the headlights .PERIOD
Now I want to close on one story ,COMMA which we think is another possibility -- which is that maybe these molecules ,COMMA if you can do ultra-precise control ,COMMA can be used in the brain itself to make a new kind of prosthetic ,COMMA an optical prosthetic .PERIOD
Maybe 100000 people have Cochlear implants ,COMMA which allow them to hear .PERIOD
And new hope in gene therapy has been developed because viruses like the adeno-associated virus ,COMMA which probably most of us around this room have ,COMMA and it doesn't have any symptoms ,COMMA which have been used in hundreds of patients to deliver genes into the brain or the body .PERIOD
And the retina ,COMMA of course ,COMMA is a complex structure .PERIOD
We're going to take these blue light photosensors and install them on a layer of cells in the middle of the retina in the back of the eye and convert them into a camera -- just like installing solar cells all over those neurons to make them light sensitive .PERIOD
So this pre-clinical study ,COMMA I think ,COMMA bodes hope for the kinds of things we're hoping to do in the future .PERIOD
And by turning things off ,COMMA it's more or less a zero .PERIOD
Does that mean that some day you could download memories and maybe upload them ?QUESTIONMARK
What determines the types and distributions of microbes indoors ?QUESTIONMARK
And we looked at three different types of rooms .PERIOD
Hospitals use two and a half times the amount of energy as office buildings .PERIOD
I've heard somebody say that you're as healthy as your gut .PERIOD
And obviously I'm physically a very strong person ,COMMA as you can tell -- -- so I wasn't worried about carrying this thing 20 blocks .PERIOD
People were out .PERIOD
And I thought ,COMMA well ,COMMA this is the power of a city .PERIOD
But the system itself of this city was thriving .PERIOD
Everybody contributes a little bit .PERIOD
Well ,COMMA it was the whole city .PERIOD
So it's been a very optimistic time ,COMMA I think ,COMMA and I want to just talk about a few of those things .PERIOD
That is -- you know ,COMMA there's no sentence that kind of conjures up that period better than that ,COMMA I think ,COMMA which is that you suddenly have the power to put up a picture of your dog and link to it ,COMMA and somebody reading the page has the power to click on that link or not click on that link .PERIOD
But it's still a very one-to-one kind of relationship .PERIOD
About two months ago ,COMMA I had the great breakthrough -- one of my great ,COMMA kind of shining achievements -- which is that my website finally became a top result for Steven Johnson .PERIOD
And in fact ,COMMA I think that's not entirely true anymore .PERIOD
That little list there would change .PERIOD
That's not necessarily something we didn't know already .PERIOD
I had no idea .PERIOD
But what's interesting is you can then broaden the search and actually see interesting things and get a sense of what else is out there .PERIOD
They're talking about slavery in 1860 .PERIOD
And OK ,COMMA I didn't learn anything new there as well -- that's pretty obvious .PERIOD
I'll go very quickly .PERIOD
It's caused a lot of controversy because people thought that this was the ultimate kind of one man ,COMMA one modem democracy ,COMMA where anybody can get out there and get their voice heard .PERIOD
And the question was ,COMMA were the birds singing ?QUESTIONMARK
Well ,COMMA in my world ,COMMA this is a rubber duck .PERIOD
That was a nice thing to get .PERIOD
If the end game is global warming ,COMMA they're doing great .PERIOD
So perhaps we could develop a strategy of change ,COMMA which requires humility .PERIOD And in my business as an architect ,COMMA it's unfortunate the word humility and the word architect have not appeared in the same paragraph since The Fountainhead .PERIOD
There is an infinite game ,COMMA and we're playing in that infinite game .PERIOD
And so we call it cradle to cradle ,COMMA and our goal is very simple .PERIOD
This is what I presented to the White House .PERIOD
So we've designed products and we analyzed chemicals down to the parts per million .PERIOD
We can ask ourselves ,COMMA what is justice ,COMMA and is justice blind ,COMMA or is justice blindness ?QUESTIONMARK
Is there anybody here who doesn't breathe ?QUESTIONMARK
Here's Dr .PERIOD Venkataswamy in India ,COMMA who's figured out how to do mass-produced health .PERIOD
They become building steel .PERIOD
My childhood summers were in the Puget Sound of Washington ,COMMA among the first growth and big growth .PERIOD
My grandfather had been a lumberjack in the Olympics ,COMMA so I have a lot of tree karma I am working off .PERIOD
So ,COMMA all of a sudden ,COMMA here I am ,COMMA graduating from high school in 1969 ,COMMA and this happens ,COMMA and we realize that away went away .PERIOD
Now if we look at the word competition ,COMMA I'm sure most of you've used it .PERIOD
You know ,COMMA most people don't realize it comes from the Latin competere ,COMMA which means strive together .PERIOD
It means the way Olympic athletes train with each other .PERIOD
So we've been looking at the idea of competition as a way of cooperating in order to get fit together .PERIOD
Now most environmentalists don't say growth is good ,COMMA because ,COMMA in our lexicon ,COMMA asphalt is two words :COLON assigning blame .PERIOD
Technical nutrition will be in an order of magnitude of biological nutrition .PERIOD
Customers .PERIOD
Biotechnical nutrients -- the Model U for Ford Motor ,COMMA a cradle to cradle car -- concept car .PERIOD
The idea here of the car is that some of the materials go back to the industry forever ,COMMA some of the materials go back to soil -- it's all solar-powered .PERIOD
We're doing 12 cities for China right now ,COMMA based on cradle to cradle as templates .PERIOD
Our assignment is to develop protocols for the housing for 400 million people in 12 years .PERIOD
We start to integrate commercial and mixed use so the people all have centers and places to be .PERIOD
And then it makes natural gas ,COMMA which then goes back into the city to power the fuel for the cooking for the city .PERIOD
And then the compost is all taken back to the roofs of the city ,COMMA where we've got farming ,COMMA because what we've done is lifted up the city ,COMMA the landscape ,COMMA into the air to -- to restore the native landscape on the roofs of the buildings .PERIOD
They're probably less cell dense .PERIOD
And they're controlling basically everything that the nervous system has to do .PERIOD
Because what we're trying to measure ,COMMA the RNA -- which is the readout from our genes -- is very labile ,COMMA and so we have to move very quickly .PERIOD
And then the laser actually cuts .PERIOD
Now this may look like a bunch of dots to you ,COMMA but each one of these individual dots is actually a unique piece of the human genome that we spotted down on glass .PERIOD
And when we take a sample and we hybridize it to it ,COMMA we get a unique fingerprint ,COMMA if you will ,COMMA quantitatively of what genes are turned on in that sample .PERIOD
So roughly ,COMMA we have 50 million data points for a given human brain .PERIOD
Green is the sort of cool areas where it's not turned on .PERIOD
Genes send the instructions to make proteins .PERIOD
So drugs bind to proteins and either turn them off ,COMMA etc .PERIOD
It's as interesting a side effect as it could be .PERIOD
One other thing you can do with such a thing is you can ,COMMA because it's a pattern matching exercise ,COMMA because there's unique fingerprint ,COMMA we can actually scan through the entire genome and find other proteins that show a similar fingerprint .PERIOD
Now they can come in and they can start to get clues about activity .PERIOD
And then we find some outliers ,COMMA some things that lie beyond the cloud .PERIOD
And those genes are interesting ,COMMA but they're very subtle .PERIOD
These are things where genes are turned on in an individual cell type .PERIOD
I think these resources are incredibly valuable .PERIOD
And there is something else I believe in the back of your mind you also know .PERIOD
And worst of all ,COMMA we will never know .PERIOD
And the reason is that -- take Africa for example .PERIOD
Africans have already got a lot of aid .PERIOD
We don't know .PERIOD
And a third question :COLON Education .PERIOD
And in this way ,COMMA you can take the guesswork out of policy-making by knowing what works ,COMMA what doesn't work and why .PERIOD
It's going from intention to action .PERIOD
We cannot keep giving lentils to people .PERIOD
We can just run an experiment .PERIOD
Second thing is ,COMMA how about the use ?QUESTIONMARK
Well ,COMMA in business ,COMMA that's certainly not the way we would go about it .PERIOD
Now I'm going to show you what we get with various education interventions .PERIOD
So now ,COMMA I started from the big problem ,COMMA and I couldn't answer it .PERIOD
In Haiti ,COMMA about 200000 people died -- actually ,COMMA a bit more by the latest estimate .PERIOD
So ,COMMA why is that ?QUESTIONMARK
With deworming ,COMMA you can get an extra year of education for three dollars .PERIOD
So this evidence is powerful .PERIOD
It can prompt action .PERIOD
These economics I'm proposing ,COMMA it's like 20 th century medicine .PERIOD
Fantastic tales ,COMMA anecdotes from speakers .PERIOD
And turnarounds are part and parcel of what I have focused on for most of my professional career .PERIOD
And she said ,COMMA I want to write a case ,COMMA Euvin -- a case on a public-sector leader that has lessons for the corporate world .PERIOD
The first thing that I saw was North America at night -- glowing ,COMMA in all its glory .PERIOD A warm feeling .PERIOD Light .PERIOD
Entrepreneurs ,COMMA dynamic people ,COMMA people with hope .PERIOD
So let's start shedding light on this amazing eclectic continent that has so much to offer .PERIOD
So I want to share with you some of these bellwether signals ,COMMA or signs ,COMMA and winds of change that are sweeping this continent .PERIOD
And let's start at the high level ,COMMA on the macro-factors .PERIOD
Egypt :COLON from the 16 percent to about 84 percent .PERIOD
But what were they there for ?QUESTIONMARK To acquire assets .PERIOD
Guarantee Trust Bank recently issued the first Euro Bond out of Africa ,COMMA and this excludes South Africa .PERIOD
22 to 24 million barrels of oil a day -- the same league as Kuwait ,COMMA the same league as Venezuela .PERIOD
So let's unpack those very quickly ,COMMA and I'm going to move through these very ,COMMA very ,COMMA very fast because I can see that clock counting down .PERIOD
What else is going on there ?QUESTIONMARK Egypt .PERIOD
Close to the Mediterranean ,COMMA near Alexandria -- textiles ,COMMA petrochemicals .PERIOD
So what are the signs that things are fundamentally changing ?QUESTIONMARK
What's going on in some of the other countries ?QUESTIONMARK
But in any investment decision ,COMMA the key question is ,COMMA What is my alternative investment ?QUESTIONMARK
Now ,COMMA when looking at Africa vis-a-vis other things ,COMMA and countries in Africa vis-a-vis other things ,COMMA comparisons become important .PERIOD
In 1899 ,COMMA Joseph Conrad released The Heart of Darkness ,COMMA a tale of grim horror along the Congo River .PERIOD
Brain magic to me indicates that area of magic dealing with psychological and mind-reading effects .PERIOD
So ,COMMA now you can see how easy it is for me to manipulate the human mind ,COMMA once you know how .PERIOD
No ,COMMA but you're OK ,COMMA yes ?QUESTIONMARK
That is weird .PERIOD
Thank you .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA I'm going to give you some demonstrations up here ,COMMA live ,COMMA right now .PERIOD
And let's see ,COMMA down at the end ,COMMA here ,COMMA can you also come up ,COMMA real quick ?QUESTIONMARK
Now ,COMMA it's very important for everybody here to realize I haven't set anything up with you guys .PERIOD
You don't know what's about to happen .PERIOD Is that agreed ?QUESTIONMARK
OK ,COMMA would you mind just standing over here for a moment ?QUESTIONMARK
Your name is ?QUESTIONMARK
OK ,COMMA a little bit closer ,COMMA come over -- they look really nervous up here .PERIOD
Voodoo ?QUESTIONMARK
Besides ,COMMA who's next ,COMMA no ,COMMA OK .PERIOD
I want you to be aware of the sensations ,COMMA but don't say anything until I ask you ,COMMA and don't open your eyes until I ask you .PERIOD
Yes or no ,COMMA did you feel anything ?QUESTIONMARK
Yeah ,COMMA I walk around nightclubs all night like this .PERIOD
And can you take a seat right over here for me ,COMMA if you don't mind .PERIOD
And I want you to hold it there ,COMMA just for a moment ,COMMA and I only want you to allow your hand to sink and drift and float back to the tabletop at the same rate and speed as you drift and float into this relaxed state of awareness ,COMMA and allow it to go all the way down to the tabletop .PERIOD
OK ,COMMA and only when you feel the pressure go back ,COMMA I want you to allow your hand to slowly drift back to the tabletop ,COMMA but only when you feel the pressure .PERIOD
Allow it to stick firmly to the tabletop ,COMMA keep your eyes closed .PERIOD
Can you stand up ?QUESTIONMARK
Imagine a connection between you and him .PERIOD
Point directly at his forehead .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA I want you to be aware that in a moment ,COMMA when I snap my fingers ,COMMA your eyes will open ,COMMA again .PERIOD
It's nearly impossible to break a Coke bottle .PERIOD
You see ,COMMA psychokinesis is the paranormal influence of the mind on physical events and processes .PERIOD
Be careful ,COMMA because it is sharp .PERIOD Just hold on to it for a moment .PERIOD
And I want you to release that negative energy by shaking it from side to side .PERIOD
There's five letters in the title .PERIOD
There's a K in his name ,COMMA there is a K .PERIOD
You knew !EXCLAMATIONMARK
No one in the audience .PERIOD And just to help you out ,COMMA I'll block them from view ,COMMA so nobody can see what you're doing .PERIOD
But I don't want you to know either ,COMMA so swivel around on your chair .PERIOD
Your right hand .PERIOD Is that -- no ,COMMA OK .PERIOD
OK ,COMMA tell me when to stop .PERIOD
Yes ,COMMA there's one .PERIOD
OK .PERIOD Do you think it's here ,COMMA yes or no ?QUESTIONMARK
Neither ,COMMA oh ,COMMA OK .PERIOD
We're the only creatures with fully developed moral sentiments .PERIOD
After 10 years of experiments ,COMMA I found it .PERIOD
It can't be that important .PERIOD
Turns out it wasn't so easy .PERIOD
And when it's produced ,COMMA it has a three-minute half-life ,COMMA and degrades rapidly at room temperature .PERIOD
Then I had to measure morality .PERIOD
So I started smaller .PERIOD
So poor countries are by and large low trust countries .PERIOD
So we recruit some people for an experiment .PERIOD
We give them lots of instruction ,COMMA and we never ever deceive them .PERIOD
So think about this experiment for minute .PERIOD
But why ?QUESTIONMARK
Two things .PERIOD
I didn't know for sure oxytocin caused trustworthiness .PERIOD
I used everything short of a drill to get oxytocin into my own brain .PERIOD
These include massage ,COMMA dancing and praying .PERIOD
In this book ,COMMA Smith argued that we are moral creatures ,COMMA not because of a top-down reason ,COMMA but for a bottom-up reason .PERIOD
So if I do something that hurts you ,COMMA I feel that pain .PERIOD
I'm working at a gas station on the outskirts of Santa Barbara ,COMMA California .PERIOD
Tell that guy to wait half an hour .PERIOD
So this is a classic con called the pigeon drop ,COMMA and I was the pigeon .PERIOD
They have many of the attributes of psychopaths .PERIOD
One is through improper nurturing .PERIOD
So we've studied sexually abused women ,COMMA and about half those don't release oxytocin on stimulus .PERIOD
She had the biggest increase in oxytocin .PERIOD
So I think it tells us that we've designed this ritual to connect us to this new couple ,COMMA connect us emotionally .PERIOD
So my penchant for hugging other people has earned me the nickname Dr .PERIOD Love .PERIOD
We have found that people who release more oxytocin are happier .PERIOD
And they're happier because they have better relationships of all types .PERIOD
I'll play at these rock shows ,COMMA be on stage standing completely still ,COMMA and they're like ,COMMA What's she doing !EXCLAMATIONMARK What's she doing !EXCLAMATIONMARK
So basically ,COMMA with both of your hands you're controlling pitch and volume and kind of trying to create the illusion that you're doing separate notes ,COMMA when really it's continuously going .PERIOD
Maybe we'll go into the next tune ,COMMA because I totally lost where this is going .PERIOD
It was invented around the 1920 s ,COMMA and the inventor ,COMMA Léon Theremin -- he also was a musician besides an inventor -- he came up with the idea for making the theremin ,COMMA I think ,COMMA when he was working on some shortwave radios .PERIOD
And then also ,COMMA you're trying to stay very ,COMMA very ,COMMA very still because little movements with other parts of your body will affect the pitch ,COMMA or sometimes if you're holding a low note -- -- and breathing will make it .PERIOD
And it's meant to kind of reflect how we engage with histories or stories on the Internet ,COMMA in a less linear form .PERIOD
He was sent in 1907 to Palestine by the Zionist organization to look at areas for Jewish settlement and acquire land for Jewish settlement .PERIOD
During the course of this trial ,COMMA all of the rabbits died ,COMMA except for a few ,COMMA which were euthanized .PERIOD
So when you look at a detail of this work ,COMMA you can see ,COMMA the man on the upper-left is the father of the woman sitting next to him .PERIOD
During the time I was in Bosnia ,COMMA the mortal remains of Zumra's eldest son were exhumed from a mass grave .PERIOD
However ,COMMA the other individuals are represented by these blue slides ,COMMA which show tooth and bone samples that were matched to DNA evidence collected from family members to prove they were the identities of those individuals .PERIOD
There's also parents who participated who wouldn't let their children participate because they thought they were too young to decide for themselves .PERIOD
It was released in Poland to create friction between Frank and Hitler ,COMMA so that Hitler would imagine Frank was trying to usurp his power .PERIOD
Again ,COMMA talking about fate ,COMMA I was interested in the stories and fate of particular works of art .PERIOD
Chapter 12 highlights people being born into a battle that is not of their making ,COMMA but becomes their own .PERIOD
I'm not quite sure whether I really want to see a snare drum at nine o'clock or so in the morning .PERIOD
And it sounds quite simple ,COMMA but actually it's quite a big ,COMMA big job .PERIOD
I will follow the instructions ,COMMA the tempo markings ,COMMA the dynamics .PERIOD
But here I'm being told that the piece of music is very quick .PERIOD
Just the basic feeling .PERIOD
We have to listen to ourselves ,COMMA first of all .PERIOD
And I just feel ,COMMA at last ,COMMA one with the stick and one with the drum .PERIOD
Not just translate them ,COMMA but interpret them .PERIOD
can be felt with just the tiniest part of your finger ,COMMA there .PERIOD
Every single one of us ,COMMA depending on where we're sitting ,COMMA will experience this sound quite ,COMMA quite differently .PERIOD
Do you see what I mean ?QUESTIONMARK So ,COMMA because of this explosion in access to sound ,COMMA especially through the deaf community ,COMMA this has not only affected how music institutions ,COMMA how schools for the deaf treat sound -- and not just as a means of therapy -- although of course ,COMMA being a participator of music ,COMMA that definitely is the case as well .PERIOD
May be great there ,COMMA but terrible up there .PERIOD
We just -- we go like that ,COMMA and we imagine that that's what deafness is about .PERIOD
In a year's time ,COMMA it could be two extra steps .PERIOD
For me ,COMMA as a musician who deals with 99 percent of new music ,COMMA it's very easy for me to say ,COMMA Oh yes ,COMMA I like that piece .PERIOD
Oh no ,COMMA I don't like that piece .PERIOD And so on .PERIOD
And please try to create that through your clapping .PERIOD Try .PERIOD Just -- please try .PERIOD
Very good !EXCLAMATIONMARK Snow .PERIOD Snow .PERIOD Have you ever heard snow ?QUESTIONMARK
Evelyn Glennie :COLON Well then ,COMMA stop clapping .PERIOD Try again .PERIOD
See ,COMMA you're awake .PERIOD
However ,COMMA not one of you got out of your seats to think ,COMMA Right !EXCLAMATIONMARK How can I clap ?QUESTIONMARK OK ,COMMA maybe .PERIOD
I may feel sorrowful ,COMMA or happy ,COMMA or exhilarated ,COMMA or angry when I play certain pieces of music ,COMMA but I'm not necessarily wanting you to feel exactly the same thing .PERIOD
The performer is in the worst possible position for the actual sound ,COMMA because they're hearing the contact of the stick on the drum ,COMMA or the mallet on the bit of wood ,COMMA or the bow on the string ,COMMA etc ,COMMA or the breath that's creating the sound from wind and brass .PERIOD
It's a video game move from Star Fox .PERIOD
And we've gone from one board to 48 boards .PERIOD
What the site's known for ,COMMA because it has this environment ,COMMA is it's fostered the creation of a lot of Internet phenomena ,COMMA viral videos and whatnot ,COMMA known as memes .PERIOD
And so there are three that I want to show you specifically .PERIOD
It is where a third of all the traffic is going .PERIOD
They got it taken offline and managed to piss off part of the Internet .PERIOD
So we've got this activist group that's this grassroots group that's come out of the site .PERIOD
Dusty is the name that we've given to this cat .PERIOD
We're sacrificing a lot of that ,COMMA and I think in doing so ,COMMA moving towards those things ,COMMA we're losing something valuable .PERIOD
You're lucky that this is not being streamed to them live right now .PERIOD
Well ,COMMA you never know .PERIOD Some of them -- we've got people in 75 countries out there watching .PERIOD
Don't tell .PERIOD
And saying whatever you like ,COMMA I think ,COMMA is powerful .PERIOD
And the thing is ,COMMA I didn't make it into that presentation because I can't read to you anything that they said ,COMMA more or less .PERIOD
Okay ,COMMA well .PERIOD
You've got this surprising semi-underground influence ,COMMA but it's not making you a lot of money ,COMMA yet .PERIOD
Yeah .PERIOD They still didn't know what to think of that though .PERIOD
Within five ,COMMA 10 million years of the bolide impact we had a whole variety of animals going into the water .PERIOD Why didn't they do that ?QUESTIONMARK
You want to measure it by diversity ?QUESTIONMARK
This slide was shown before .PERIOD This is the famous Jurassic bird Archaeopteryx .PERIOD
If we could roll that first video clip .PERIOD
But one with an immense chalkboard in the middle ,COMMA with lots of little areas of dinosaur rock if you could survive an expedition .PERIOD
And the kinds of teams they bring in ?QUESTIONMARK
So ,COMMA you are finding yourself also in an amazing cultural milieu .PERIOD
You're really rubbing shoulders with the world's last great nomadic people .PERIOD
Here's the animal that was causing it trouble .PERIOD
It is an incredible view of life ,COMMA and it really began when we began to understand the depth of time .PERIOD
We prototyped by CAT-scanning the brain out of this animal .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA this field is just -- and ,COMMA of course ,COMMA science in general -- is just -- adventure .PERIOD
Narrator :COLON If they can just land it ,COMMA this croc will provide useful data ,COMMA helping Paul in his quest to understand Sarcosuchus .PERIOD
I've got it .PERIOD I've got the back legs .PERIOD
Paul Sereno :COLON Let's get this tape measure on him .PERIOD Put it right there .PERIOD
Wow .PERIOD
Anyway ,COMMA you find other things ,COMMA too .PERIOD
These are all landlubbing animals .PERIOD There's a couple of choices .PERIOD
And you take those four instances and you realize you have a complex problem .PERIOD
They did it within two or three degrees of the pole ,COMMA to maintain similarity between continents .PERIOD
Now we have divergence over time ,COMMA but we've created the third dimension of area .PERIOD
I was a total failure in school ,COMMA not really headed to graduate high school .PERIOD
What about all the kids like me that were in school -- kids like some of you out there -- that were in school and didn't get a chance and will never get a chance to participate in science and technology ?QUESTIONMARK
Because when you go out there as a scholar ,COMMA and you try to find out longitudinal studies ,COMMA track records like that ,COMMA there essentially are very few ,COMMA if none .PERIOD
Thank you very much .PERIOD
And as a little girl ,COMMA I loved the idea of a robot that interacted with us much more like a helpful ,COMMA trusted sidekick -- something that would delight us ,COMMA enrich our lives and help us save a galaxy or two .PERIOD
I almost lost it this week .PERIOD
Leo ,COMMA this is Cookie Monster .PERIOD
We looked at psychological involvement -- how much empathy did you feel for the other person ?QUESTIONMARK
We looked at their desire to cooperate .PERIOD
Today we know that families are living further and further apart ,COMMA and that definitely takes a toll on family relationships and family bonds over distance .PERIOD
And as grandma-bot ,COMMA she can now play ,COMMA really play ,COMMA with my sons ,COMMA with her grandsons ,COMMA in the real world with his real toys .PERIOD
Another was a computer that ran the same touch-screen interface ,COMMA ran exactly the same dialogues .PERIOD
The quality of advice was identical .PERIOD
We've invited a lot of kids into this space ,COMMA and they think it's pretty cool .PERIOD
That's her competition .PERIOD
Paula Radcliffe ,COMMA the one person who is sure to snatch the big paycheck out of Derartu Tulu's under-underdog hands ,COMMA suddenly grabs her leg and starts to fall back .PERIOD
They're not doing 26 miles ;SEMICOLON they're doing 100 ,COMMA 150 miles at a time ,COMMA and apparently without injury ,COMMA without problems .PERIOD
And if you know it ,COMMA then you are smarter than anybody else on planet Earth .PERIOD
Australopithecus had a tiny little pea brain .PERIOD
The only problem is ,COMMA the first edged weapons only appeared about 200000 years ago .PERIOD
We're not fast .PERIOD
Her uterus would be torn .PERIOD
Then you go beyond 26 miles ,COMMA into the distance that medical science also told us would be fatal to humans -- remember Pheidippides died when he ran 26 miles -- you get to 50 and 100 miles ,COMMA and suddenly it's a different game .PERIOD
Well Emily Baer -- 500 runners -- she finishes in eighth place ,COMMA in the top 10 ,COMMA even though she stopped at all the aid stations to breastfeed her baby during the race -- and yet ,COMMA beat 492 other people .PERIOD
And you'll get slower and slower ,COMMA until eventually you're back to running the same speed you were at age 19 .PERIOD
Now I defy you to come up with any other physical activity -- and please don't say golf -- something that actually is hard -- where geriatrics are performing as well as they did as teenagers .PERIOD
Maybe we evolved as a hunting pack animal .PERIOD
Well if that's true ,COMMA a couple other things had to be true as well .PERIOD
The key to being part of a hunting pack is the word pack .PERIOD
You need to have those 27 -year-old studs at the peak of their powers ready to drop the kill ,COMMA and you need to have those teenagers there who are learning the whole thing all involved .PERIOD
You can't be hauling all your crap around ,COMMA trying to chase the antelope .PERIOD
He pissed me off .PERIOD Let him go chase his own antelope .PERIOD
Geronimo used to say that ,COMMA My only friends are my legs .PERIOD I only trust my legs .PERIOD
That's because an Apache triathlon used to be you'd run 50 miles across the desert ,COMMA engage in hand-to-hand combat ,COMMA steal a bunch of horses and slap leather for home .PERIOD
I didn't do yoga .PERIOD I'm not ready .PERIOD
So hopefully it's something we can all benefit from .PERIOD
I show a number of photographs and films ,COMMA but I also make television programs ,COMMA books and some advertising ,COMMA all with the same concept .PERIOD
I was fascinated by this phenomenon ,COMMA so I wondered :COLON could one erase the image of Diana ,COMMA actually quite crudely and physically ?QUESTIONMARK
Momentum was being built .PERIOD
I then went on wondering whether I could actually replace her image ,COMMA so I got a look-alike of Diana and posed her in the right positions and angles and created something that was in ,COMMA or existed in ,COMMA the public imagination .PERIOD
So ,COMMA this is an image of Diana looking at Camilla kissing her husband ,COMMA and this was a sequence of images .PERIOD
All this imagery was creating a lot of fuss and I was cited as a disgusting artist .PERIOD The press were writing about this ,COMMA giving full pages about how terrible this was .PERIOD
But then this changed suddenly .PERIOD
I was sitting next to someone at dinner the other day ,COMMA and they were saying there's this great image of the Queen sitting outside William Hill .PERIOD
I explored with actually dressing up as the celebrities myself .PERIOD
And me as the Queen .PERIOD
I then continued on to make a whole body of work about Marilyn -- the biggest icon of all -- and trying to titillate by shooting through doorways and shutters and so on and so forth ,COMMA and only showing certain angles to create a reality that ,COMMA obviously ,COMMA is completely constructed .PERIOD
I did an advertising campaign for Schweppes ,COMMA which is Coca-Cola ,COMMA and so that was very interesting in terms of the legalities .PERIOD
Tony Blair and Cherie .PERIOD And again ,COMMA the legalities -- we had to be very careful .PERIOD
And the press were interviewing ,COMMA and I was signing my book .PERIOD
And in fact ,COMMA George Bush and Tony Blair are having great fun during all of this .PERIOD
So there was a lot of meaning in my life because I was performing this type of research during the day .PERIOD
My left hemisphere -- our left hemisphere -- is a very different place .PERIOD
Our left hemisphere is all about the past and it's all about the future .PERIOD
It's that ongoing brain chatter that connects me and my internal world to my external world .PERIOD
I become a single solid individual ,COMMA separate from the energy flow around me and separate from you .PERIOD

So ,COMMA the idea is ,COMMA by watching Saturn we're actually watching our solar system in real time being formed on a smaller scale ,COMMA so it's like a test bed for it .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA you think that those rings are very large objects .PERIOD
That was [unclear] also -- you know ,COMMA because we were worried about the risk of it ,COMMA but it worked pretty well .PERIOD
So people believe now that Titan is most likely what we call a pre-biotic planet ,COMMA because it's so cold organic material did not get to the stage of becoming biological material ,COMMA and therefore life could have evolved on it .PERIOD
So here we have a cycle of a planet which is like our Earth ,COMMA but is all made of ethane and methane and organic material .PERIOD

It changed our view of the physical world .PERIOD
Some would argue that it is those images that did more to fuel the insurgency in Iraq than virtually any other single act .PERIOD

This is actually a direct quote from an epidemiologist who's been in field of HIV for 15 years ,COMMA worked on four continents ,COMMA and you're looking at her .PERIOD
And so everyone lined up ,COMMA all the smackheads in a row ,COMMA and the guy whose birthday it was filled up the fit ,COMMA and he went down and started injecting people .PERIOD

So what's that about ?QUESTIONMARK Is it like you get a better high if you share or something ?QUESTIONMARK
So she was making a politically rational decision .PERIOD

Of course ,COMMA you can't get HIV just by having unprotected sex .PERIOD
And ,COMMA again ,COMMA it's because of an alignment of the incentives .PERIOD
And ,COMMA actually ,COMMA clients don't want to go home with a drip either .PERIOD
He's from Haiti and he has AIDS .PERIOD

Good news :COLON Chariot's coming .PERIOD

Financially ,COMMA seen over the long term ,COMMA it was actually successful .PERIOD
We were asked to design an identity for Casa da Musica ,COMMA the Rem Koolhaas-built music center in Porto ,COMMA in Portugal .PERIOD

Some of you might have seen it .PERIOD
So after eight hours that's pretty much all that was left of the whole thing .PERIOD
So I'll just give you my message up front :COLON Try not to go extinct .PERIOD
People ask me a lot -- in fact ,COMMA one of the most asked questions I get is ,COMMA why do children like dinosaurs so much ?QUESTIONMARK
Every museum wanted a little bigger or better one than anybody else had .PERIOD
So everyone was out looking for all these bigger and better dinosaurs .PERIOD
And they thought about it and they even wrote papers about it :COLON Where are the little dinosaurs ?QUESTIONMARK
First off ,COMMA scientists have egos ,COMMA and scientists like to name dinosaurs .PERIOD
So this is where people went astray again .PERIOD
But I have a museum and I collect dinosaurs and I can saw mine open .PERIOD
And if you cut into an older dinosaur ,COMMA it's very massive .PERIOD
So here's a dinosaur that has spikes sticking out of its head ,COMMA no dome and gnarly stuff on its nose .PERIOD
Nobody noticed the gnarly stuff sort of looked alike .PERIOD
Dracorex is the littlest one ,COMMA Stygimoloch is the middle size one ,COMMA Pachycephalosaurus is the largest one .PERIOD
But it didn't give them a clue .PERIOD
So we have a whole bunch of them at our museum .PERIOD
And then as they grow older ,COMMA the horns grow forward .PERIOD
If you look along the edge of the frill ,COMMA they have these little triangular bones that actually grow big as triangles and then they flatten against the frill pretty much like the spikes do on the Pachycephalosaurs .PERIOD
And we get rid of Anatotitan .PERIOD
So again ,COMMA real easy to say that Tyrannosaurus ontogeny included Nanotyrannus ,COMMA and therefore we can take out another dinosaur .PERIOD
Now as you can imagine ,COMMA this is not very popular with fourth-graders .PERIOD
This is Soft Sell for 42 nd Street .PERIOD
They weren't doing their primary work ,COMMA which was for the government ,COMMA while they were helping us with this .PERIOD
And many musicians choose to use the theater glass walls totally open .PERIOD

Emmanuel ?QUESTIONMARK Absolutely .PERIOD
So ,COMMA that's going to look pretty shabby now .PERIOD
So ,COMMA what I thought I'd do is -- in honor of Emmanuel -- is ,COMMA what I can do is to launch today the first TED Global auction .PERIOD
And he'll say ,COMMA You're offering me things that are infinitely variable .PERIOD
And she's desperate to find more evidence for the link .PERIOD

No .PERIOD
Alright ,COMMA it was never exactly 'Brokeback Mountain' You know ,COMMA I wrote to him ,COMMA just before I left office .PERIOD I said ,COMMA 'Can I rely on your support for the next month' And he wrote back .PERIOD He said ,COMMA 'No ,COMMA you can't' Which kind of surprised me ,COMMA because I'd never seen 'can't' spelled that way before .PERIOD
When you think what's happened to financial services ,COMMA and you see what's happened to the economy ,COMMA you think ,COMMA Well ,COMMA there is a man who delivers on his promises .PERIOD
And ,COMMA you know ,COMMA Iceland ,COMMA it was never going to cut it .PERIOD
Luckily ,COMMA somebody like George Bush was really helpful .PERIOD
He summed it up ,COMMA really ,COMMA at a dinner .PERIOD
And then ,COMMA you're now ,COMMA well ,COMMA actually ,COMMA that's what this is about .PERIOD
Well ,COMMA you know I'm sorry about that .PERIOD
And you want a leader who inspires and challenges and makes you want to be a better citizen .PERIOD Right ?QUESTIONMARK
So he comes over to this country ,COMMA and he says ,COMMA We need a big fiscal stimulus .PERIOD
He goes to Prague ,COMMA he says ,COMMA We believe in a nuclear-free world .PERIOD
Do you remember that ?QUESTIONMARK George Bush ,COMMA A nu-ca-ler .PERIOD
who said ,COMMA reach out and touch .PERIOD
So ,COMMA Nelson ,COMMA how would you like a nice water feature ?QUESTIONMARK
And we need six to eight waist-high plants per person .PERIOD

Our studies have found that there is a 42 percent probability of one's blood oxygen going up by one percent if one stays indoors in this building for 10 hours .PERIOD

Why is this important ?QUESTIONMARK
So how do you feel about that -- the whole -- MA :COLON Well ,COMMA it's pretty irritating actually because nobody ever describes what a man is wearing .PERIOD
And no guy ever gets criticized .PERIOD But that's the least of it .PERIOD
How did you handle that balance between being the tough diplomatic and strong voice of this country to the rest of the world and also how you felt about yourself as a mother ,COMMA a grandmother ,COMMA nurturing .PERIOD
and so how did you handle that ?QUESTIONMARK
Because in her lifetime -- MA :COLON That would be so .PERIOD
Thank you for joining us today .PERIOD
My little group of molecular programmers are trying to refashion all of these parts from DNA .PERIOD
And if you buy all of this ,COMMA and you think life is about computation ,COMMA as I do ,COMMA then you look at big questions through the eyes of a computer scientist .PERIOD
This is exactly analogous to the question ,COMMA what's the smallest program I can write that will act exactly like Microsoft Word ?QUESTIONMARK
And just as he's writing ,COMMA you know ,COMMA bacteria that will be smaller ,COMMA he's writing genomes that will work ,COMMA we could write smaller programs that would do what Microsoft Word does .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA these are big questions in computer science .PERIOD
That holds the long strand like this .PERIOD
I wanted to fold DNA into something that goes up over the eye ,COMMA down the nose ,COMMA up the nose ,COMMA around the forehead ,COMMA back down and end in a little loop like this .PERIOD
It's got a needle ,COMMA like a record needle ,COMMA that goes back and forth over the surface ,COMMA bumps up and down ,COMMA and feels the height of the first surface .PERIOD
She wrote all her own software to design and built this DNA origami ,COMMA a beautiful rendition of China ,COMMA which even has Taiwan ,COMMA and you can see it's sort of on the world's shortest leash ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK
Now ,COMMA this is just a single switch and you need half a billion for a computer ,COMMA so we have a long way to go .PERIOD
The DNA origami is a proof that that compiler actually works .PERIOD
The fact is that it does not scale .PERIOD
So now ,COMMA we can use this counting to try and get at much bigger things than DNA origami could otherwise .PERIOD
You can just change a couple of the DNA strands in this binary representation and you'll get 96 rather than 32 .PERIOD
Here is a DNA origami rectangle ,COMMA and here are some tiles growing from it .PERIOD
So ,COMMA it turns out we actually had this idea nine years ago ,COMMA and that's about the time constant for how long it takes to do these kinds of things ,COMMA so I think we made a lot of progress .PERIOD
We've got ideas about how to fix these errors .PERIOD
What it's really about is taking computer science and looking at big questions in a new light ,COMMA asking new versions of those big questions and trying to understand how biology can make such amazing things .PERIOD Thank you .PERIOD
Therefore ,COMMA it would be too risky to release these animals ,COMMA both for the released and for the natural populations .PERIOD
So ,COMMA this is not new ,COMMA people have been doing this around the world .PERIOD
So ,COMMA these genes are indeed going back to the populations .PERIOD
So ,COMMA I say ,COMMA Let's study more ,COMMA let's shed light on this issue ,COMMA let's do whatever we can .PERIOD
This song kind of came out of all of that .PERIOD
We ended up being the first medical response team in every incident location and transported 125 victims ,COMMA saving life .PERIOD
And the other is Moksha-Yug Access ,COMMA which is integrating rural supply chain on the foundations of self-help group-based microfinance .PERIOD
Now I come back to the idea of the new social enterprise that I'm exploring .PERIOD
Often it is the constraining or the back-to-the-wall situation that the hapless common man finds himself or herself in that leads him to pay a bribe .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA let me ask you another question .PERIOD
But you also don't have the time ,COMMA resources ,COMMA expertise or wherewithal to fight this .PERIOD
Like a bribe buster service ,COMMA or 1 - 800 -Fight-Bribes ,COMMA or wwwstopbribesorg or wwwpreventcorruptionorg .PERIOD
I don't want to be haunted by such images any more .PERIOD
A set of people actually say ,COMMA Oh ,COMMA let me just grant it to them ,COMMA and run away from it .PERIOD
But the one thing I want you to notice about them is this :COLON even though this is a very long list ,COMMA there isn't a single thing on it that involves other human beings .PERIOD
And yet ,COMMA when some psychologists interviewed hospital janitors to get a sense of what they thought their jobs were like ,COMMA they encountered Mike ,COMMA who told them about how he stopped mopping the floor because Mr .PERIOD Jones was out of his bed getting a little exercise ,COMMA trying to build up his strength ,COMMA walking slowly up and down the hall .PERIOD
And then there was Luke ,COMMA who washed the floor in a comatose young man's room twice because the man's father ,COMMA who had been keeping a vigil for six months ,COMMA didn't see Luke do it the first time ,COMMA and his father was angry .PERIOD
A wise person knows when and how to make the exception to every rule ,COMMA as the janitors knew when to ignore the job duties in the service of other objectives .PERIOD
A wise person is like a jazz musician -- using the notes on the page ,COMMA but dancing around them ,COMMA inventing combinations that are appropriate for the situation and the people at hand .PERIOD
A wise person knows how to use these moral skills in the service of the right aims .PERIOD
Dad ,COMMA being an academic ,COMMA had no idea that Mike's Hard Lemonade contained alcohol .PERIOD
And they were ready to let the kid go .PERIOD
When things go wrong ,COMMA as of course they do ,COMMA we reach for two tools to try to fix them .PERIOD
Say 75 items in this script to teach a 25 -page picture book .PERIOD
Scripts like these are insurance policies against disaster .PERIOD
Jazz musicians need some notes -- most of them need some notes on the page .PERIOD
We need more rules for the bankers ,COMMA God knows .PERIOD
Some psychologists went around and polled citizens who were very well informed .PERIOD
They said ,COMMA If we paid you six weeks' salary every year would you be willing to have a nuclear waste dump in your community ?QUESTIONMARK
We see this in medicine .PERIOD
I don't know how many of you remember this :COLON another moral hero ,COMMA 15 years ago ,COMMA Aaron Feuerstein ,COMMA who was the head of Malden Mills in Massachusetts -- they made Polartec -- The factory burned down .PERIOD
And a bonus he's discovering is he's actually going to make even more money .PERIOD
In many ways this is the perfect example .PERIOD
So there's a lot here at TED ,COMMA and at other places ,COMMA to celebrate .PERIOD
There are ordinary heroes .PERIOD
Even the wisest and most well-meaning people will give up if they have to swim against the current in the organizations in which they work .PERIOD
And any moral work depends upon practical wisdom .PERIOD
I think there is reason for hope .PERIOD

And we ought to give it to them .PERIOD
That one was way more difficult than I had expected .PERIOD
When the rescue workers came they resuscitated him and there was no brain damage .PERIOD
So ,COMMA I took that as a challenge ,COMMA basically .PERIOD
And I stayed inside of that water tank hoping my core temperature would start to drop .PERIOD
So ,COMMA I realized that was completely not going to work .PERIOD
So ,COMMA I went to talk to a doctor friend ,COMMA and I asked him how could I do that ?QUESTIONMARK
Then I actually started thinking about liquid breathing .PERIOD
You blow in and out .PERIOD
And you're really ridding your body of CO 2 .PERIOD
And his total lung capacity is twice the size of an average person .PERIOD
I had to drop 50 pounds in three months .PERIOD
Every bit of food was exactly what it was for its nutritional value .PERIOD
And I started to really adapt my body .PERIOD
I assumed that I could put a water tank at Lincoln center and if I stayed there a week not eating ,COMMA I would get comfortable in that situation and I would slow my metabolism ,COMMA which I was sure would help me hold my breath longer than I had been able to do it .PERIOD
And I thought everything seemed to be on track .PERIOD
And by seven minutes I had gone into these awful convulsions .PERIOD
This was a different record .PERIOD This was a pure O 2 static apnea record that Guinness had set the world record at 13 minutes .PERIOD
A hypoxic tent is a tent that simulates altitude at 15000 feet .PERIOD
But for TV they wanted me to be upright so they could see my face ,COMMA basically .PERIOD
That made me extremely nervous ,COMMA raising the heart rate .PERIOD
And there is no way to slow my heart rate down .PERIOD
And I started having ischemia to the heart .PERIOD
My heartbeat would go from 120 ,COMMA to 50 ,COMMA to 150 ,COMMA to 40 ,COMMA to 20 ,COMMA to 150 again .PERIOD
So ,COMMA I let my feet out ,COMMA and I started floating to the top .PERIOD
They had doctors with the Pst ,COMMA you know ,COMMA so ,COMMA sitting there waiting .PERIOD
As a magician I try to show things to people that seem impossible .PERIOD
And then he stopped .PERIOD Walking in front of him was her .PERIOD
Sure ,COMMA she had aged a little .PERIOD
Gusty entered her boldly and made love to her rhythmically while she filmed him ,COMMA because she was a keen amateur pornographer .PERIOD
And that provides the ground for a type of action ,COMMA because consensus of each moment allows us to act .PERIOD
We have three critical terms :COLON economy ,COMMA civil society and the state .PERIOD
We propose 10 .PERIOD
The least important form of capital ,COMMA in this project ,COMMA is financial capital -- money .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA the issue that should concern us here -- and that's the challenge that I would like to pose to this group -- is again ,COMMA it takes 16 years in your countries to produce somebody with a BS .PERIOD degree .PERIOD
Every conceivable form of infrastructure had broken down .PERIOD
So ,COMMA when violence erupts in a country like Afghanistan ,COMMA it's because of that legacy .PERIOD
Look ,COMMA there's a very little known fact :COLON countries that have a legal average income per capita of 1000 dollars don't produce drugs .PERIOD
Cotton does not compete with opium ;SEMICOLON a t-shirt does .PERIOD
I'm all for it ;SEMICOLON after all ,COMMA I raised a lot of it .PERIOD
And then I'll let you in on a secret ,COMMA which is why I am an incurable optimist .PERIOD
Well ,COMMA it's been calculated a few degrees' rise in the earth's temperature would melt the polar ice caps .PERIOD
And the trends for those who are at the periphery of our society ,COMMA who are the poorest and the most vulnerable ,COMMA the trends give rise to a great case for pessimism .PERIOD
It will cause rising seas .PERIOD It will cause saline deposited into wells and into lands .PERIOD
For some ,COMMA it will lead to anger ,COMMA religious and sectarian violence and terrorism .PERIOD
A minimum of 20 to 30 inches of increase in sea levels is the best case that we can hope for ,COMMA and it could be 10 times that .PERIOD
Enough of the bad news .PERIOD Human beings have always risen to the challenge .PERIOD
20 years ago ,COMMA there were three and a half million .PERIOD
This disease is called sudden wealth syndrome .PERIOD
All throughout the technology world ,COMMA we're seeing young people bitten by this disease of sudden wealth syndrome .PERIOD
More reasons to be optimistic :COLON in the ' 60 s ,COMMA and I am a creature of the ' 60 s ,COMMA there was a movement .PERIOD
And on July 7 th ,COMMA around the world ,COMMA I learned only yesterday ,COMMA there will be global Live Earth concerts .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA that doesn't mean that people understand that global warming hurts the poorest and the weakest the most .PERIOD
We visited every house in India ,COMMA searching for smallpox -- 120 million houses ,COMMA once every month ,COMMA for nearly two years .PERIOD
Thank you very much .PERIOD
In the history of our planet ,COMMA there have been three great waves of evolution .PERIOD
But we had to do it the hard way in the old days by choosing offspring that looked a particular way and then breeding them .PERIOD
The scientists that made this cute little creature ended up slaughtering it and eating it afterwards .PERIOD
A cama is a camel-llama hybrid ,COMMA created to try to get the hardiness of a camel with some of the personality traits of a llama .PERIOD
They did it with puppies .PERIOD
And so some states have decided to allow them ,COMMA some states have decided to ban them .PERIOD
And before you get too worried about it ,COMMA here in the United States ,COMMA the majority of food you buy in the supermarket already has genetically-modified components to it .PERIOD
This is Prometea ,COMMA the first cloned horse .PERIOD
These were the first cloned calves ,COMMA the first cloned grey wolves ,COMMA and then ,COMMA finally ,COMMA the first cloned piglets :COLON Alexis ,COMMA Chista ,COMMA Carrel ,COMMA Janie and Dotcom .PERIOD
This is the use of animals now to create drugs and other things in their bodies that we want to create .PERIOD
These are two creatures that were created in order to save endangered species .PERIOD
And now ,COMMA using a joystick ,COMMA they can send this creature around the lab and control whether it goes left or right ,COMMA forwards or backwards .PERIOD
We've taken away the autonomy of this animal .PERIOD
And he used that as the IT piece of a mechanism which ran a flight simulator .PERIOD
I don't know ,COMMA but in fact it is a fully living brain that we have managed to keep alive to do our bidding .PERIOD
This is a mouse created by Charles Vacanti of the University of Massachusetts .PERIOD
This is what Frankenstein's lab looks like .PERIOD
We are not only already using these things in animals ,COMMA some of them we're already beginning to use on our own bodies .PERIOD
He was raised by very supportive and interested parents .PERIOD
And the observations that he made on that epic journey were to be eventually distilled into his wonderful book ,COMMA On the Origin of Species ,COMMA published 150 years ago .PERIOD
Now what is so interesting and to some ,COMMA the extent ,COMMA what's a bit infamous about The Origin of Species ,COMMA is that there is only one line in it about human evolution .PERIOD
If only Darwin had NASA .PERIOD
This has tremendous implications for our understanding of the evolution of human skin pigmentation .PERIOD
And that skin pigmentation itself was a product of evolution .PERIOD
So ,COMMA living at the equator ,COMMA we got lots and lots of ultraviolet radiation and the melanin -- this wonderful ,COMMA complex ,COMMA ancient polymer compound in our skin -- served as a superb natural sunscreen .PERIOD
Major moves ,COMMA outside of our equatorial homeland ,COMMA from Africa into other parts of the Old World ,COMMA and most recently ,COMMA into the New World .PERIOD
But it's all UVA ,COMMA and ,COMMA significantly ,COMMA that UVA has no ability to make vitamin D in your skin .PERIOD
Humans have been on the move for a long time .PERIOD
Here are just some of the biggest movements of people ,COMMA voluntary movements ,COMMA in the last 5000 years .PERIOD
And not all these moves were voluntary .PERIOD
Evolution helps us .PERIOD
But we need to think about how he compares ,COMMA in terms of his pigmentation ,COMMA to other people on Earth .PERIOD
They also run the risk of vitamin D deficiency ,COMMA if they have desk jobs ,COMMA like that guy .PERIOD
Darwin ,COMMA I think ,COMMA would have appreciated this ,COMMA even though he eschewed the importance of climate on the evolution of pigmentation during his own life .PERIOD
Well ,COMMA the topic I'm going to discuss is one which is ,COMMA in a certain sense ,COMMA very peculiar because it's very old .PERIOD
Now why do I show a cauliflower ,COMMA a very ordinary and ancient vegetable ?QUESTIONMARK
If you try to weigh it -- of course it's very easy to weigh it ,COMMA and when you eat it ,COMMA the weight matters -- but suppose you try to measure its surface .PERIOD
If you cut ,COMMA with a sharp knife ,COMMA one of the florets of a cauliflower and look at it separately ,COMMA you think of a whole cauliflower ,COMMA but smaller .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA what did humanity do with that ?QUESTIONMARK
Well ,COMMA surprisingly enough ,COMMA it's good in many ways .PERIOD
It used to be very time-consuming ,COMMA but now it's nothing .PERIOD
Anatomists were arguing very much about that .PERIOD
This cloud is completely ,COMMA 100 percent artificial .PERIOD
And the only part which is natural is a number ,COMMA the roughness of the cloud ,COMMA which is taken from nature .PERIOD
Mathematicians got into self-praise to an extent which was absolutely amazing ,COMMA that man can invent things that nature did not know .PERIOD
In particular ,COMMA it could invent things like a curve which fills the plane .PERIOD
I read the book that Mr .PERIOD Eiffel wrote about his tower ,COMMA and indeed it was astonishing how much he understood .PERIOD
Then I was telling my assistant ,COMMA I don't see anything .PERIOD Can you paint it ?QUESTIONMARK
It was very easy ,COMMA and you can write many books very fast about it .PERIOD
In a way ,COMMA it's the story of my life .PERIOD
If you could find something new ,COMMA anything ,COMMA you will get your career made .PERIOD
It's so complicated .PERIOD
Obviously ,COMMA from extraterrestrials .PERIOD
Thank you very much .PERIOD
In 1984 ,COMMA in what can only be considered one of the greatest crimes of humanity ,COMMA nearly one million people died of starvation in my country of birth ,COMMA Ethiopia .PERIOD
Not because there was not enough food -- because there was actually a surplus of food in the fertile regions of the south parts of the country -- but because in the north ,COMMA people could not access or entitle themselves to that food .PERIOD
Most Africans today ,COMMA by far ,COMMA are farmers .PERIOD
It also has very high cost implications .PERIOD
Speaking of risk ,COMMA we have seen that price volatility of food crops in Africa is the highest in the world .PERIOD
In the American Midwest ,COMMA farmers used to load grain onto barges and send it upriver to the Chicago market .PERIOD
What's really important is that the ECX will operate a market information system to disseminate prices in real time to farmers around the country ,COMMA using VSAT technology to bring an electronic price dissemination directly to farmers .PERIOD
And they come to the market knowing what grades their products will achieve in terms of a price premium .PERIOD
We believe that the winds of change are here ,COMMA and that we can do it .PERIOD
We believe that the stakes are high ,COMMA but that the returns will be even greater .PERIOD
Ethiopia's agricultural market is 30 percent higher than South Africa's grain production ,COMMA and ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA Ethiopia is the second largest maize producer in Africa .PERIOD
It's a bit funny to be at a conference dedicated to things not seen ,COMMA and present my proposal to build a 6000 -kilometer-long wall across the entire African continent .PERIOD
The threat is desertification .PERIOD
It is always the same ,COMMA never the same ,COMMA endlessly fascinating .PERIOD
One billion grains of sand come into existence in the world each second .PERIOD
Just south of the Sahara we find the Sahel .PERIOD
Now there is an alternative to just planting trees and hoping that they won't get chopped down .PERIOD
Inside of the dunes we find shade .PERIOD
Here I am ,COMMA playing the part of the mad scientist ,COMMA working with the bugs at UCL in London ,COMMA trying to solidify them .PERIOD
Well ,COMMA I was inspired ,COMMA for my architectural form ,COMMA by tafoni ,COMMA which look a little bit like this ,COMMA this is a model representation of it .PERIOD
These are cavernous rock structures that I found on the site in Sokoto .PERIOD
That's not true at all .PERIOD
So ,COMMA there it is -- architectural anti-desertification structures made from the desert itself .PERIOD
My design ,COMMA as it takes you down the rabbit hole ,COMMA is fraught with many challenges and difficulties in the real world .PERIOD
Our goal is a repository of published designs so clear ,COMMA so complete ,COMMA that a single burned DVD is effectively a civilization starter kit .PERIOD
He was talking about the space aliens .PERIOD
I have never built an atomic pile .PERIOD
Think about it .PERIOD
I was pretty good at the video games .PERIOD I was not very good at the other part ,COMMA so I stayed alone with the cosmos .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA you could describe this as a simple misunderstanding -- a strange encounter among humans .PERIOD
I went with my friend Tim McGonigal ,COMMA who sat on my left .PERIOD
I remember ,COMMA she had some sort of injury to her ankle ,COMMA an Ace bandage ,COMMA and she had crutches .PERIOD
I was starting high school at the time .PERIOD I would say she was a junior ,COMMA but I had never seen her before .PERIOD She didn't go to my school .PERIOD
I mean ,COMMA I liked him a lot better than the sandworms .PERIOD
Except for the girl .PERIOD
And the way I remember it ,COMMA the movie featured these details .PERIOD
But I was exhausted and dog-bitten ,COMMA and so I said ,COMMA No .PERIOD
I realized that the day would only have two possible outcomes :COLON either Catherine would come back to the hotel ,COMMA or she would never come back to the hotel .PERIOD
But he did not seem so very sure ,COMMA for he sat down to wait with me .PERIOD
I mean ,COMMA somebody pays you to go around and travel and look at some of the most beautiful places on the planet .PERIOD
We know that hurricanes have always happened in the past .PERIOD
We hear a lot about the collapse of cod .PERIOD
It's a little hard to understand that ,COMMA because you can go to a Costco in the United States and buy cheap fish .PERIOD
The trophy fish were so big that you couldn't put any of those small fish up on it .PERIOD
And people paid less in 1950 dollars to catch that than what people pay now to catch those little ,COMMA tiny fish .PERIOD
You can see the rows in the bottom ,COMMA the way you can see the rows in a field that has just been plowed to plant corn .PERIOD
It was when I was on holiday last early autumn in France .PERIOD
This is from the coast of Brittany ,COMMA which is being enveloped in this green ,COMMA algal slime .PERIOD
The governments of the world are taking this really seriously .PERIOD
The consequence of that is that all those nutrients that fuel the great anchoveta fisheries ,COMMA of the sardines of California or in Peru or whatever ,COMMA those slow down and those fisheries collapse .PERIOD
Now I haven't got anything against efficiency .PERIOD
In the world I describe to you ,COMMA we have to be right over here at the right-hand side at six grams of carbon .PERIOD
So I want to just spend a couple of minutes on system dynamics .PERIOD
So it looks a little bit like this .PERIOD
That's called the circular flow of the economy .PERIOD
They want to hunker down ,COMMA they want to look to the future .PERIOD
Are we these novelty-seeking ,COMMA hedonistic ,COMMA selfish individuals ?QUESTIONMARK
It is about allowing ourselves the freedom to become fully human ,COMMA recognizing the depth and the breadth of the human psyche and building institutions to protect Rembrandt's fragile altruist within .PERIOD
And we're going to do it .PERIOD
We're just going to click on Naturejobsuk .PERIOD
And this too requires investment ,COMMA investment -- for example ,COMMA in places -- places where we can connect ,COMMA places where we can participate ,COMMA shared spaces ,COMMA concert halls ,COMMA gardens ,COMMA public parks ,COMMA libraries ,COMMA museums ,COMMA quiet centers ,COMMA places of joy and celebration ,COMMA places of tranquility and contemplation ,COMMA sites for the cultivation of a common citizenship ,COMMA in Michael Sandel's lovely phrase .PERIOD
Chris Anderson :COLON While they're taking the podium away ,COMMA just a quick question .PERIOD
You're making news out of the things that tell you that we're flourishing .PERIOD
But it has to have political leadership .PERIOD
The napalm is burning there quite nicely .PERIOD
Oil doesn't sink ,COMMA it floats .PERIOD
And the other thing it does is it spreads out the moment it hits the water .PERIOD
It triples the amount of oily ,COMMA messy goo that you have in the water ,COMMA and it makes it very hard to handle .PERIOD
When the chemistry of the oil and water also hits our politics ,COMMA it's absolutely explosive .PERIOD
They have a eureka !EXCLAMATIONMARK moment ,COMMA when we suddenly understand oil in a different context .PERIOD
You might notice that many gas pumps ,COMMA including this one ,COMMA are designed to look like ATMs .PERIOD
Early journalists looked at these spills ,COMMA and they said ,COMMA This is a filthy industry .PERIOD
And the thing about John D .PERIOD is that he went into this chaotic wild-east of oil industry ,COMMA and he rationalized it into a vertically integrated company ,COMMA a multinational .PERIOD
And then there's this guy ,COMMA okay .PERIOD
So the thing about water oil spills is that they are very politically galvanizing .PERIOD
They really influence people .PERIOD
Everything that we are really stemmed from this period .PERIOD
One of the things that happened with the two previous oil spills was that we really worked on some of the symptoms .PERIOD
And these guys ,COMMA I mean ,COMMA if they were in the US ,COMMA they might be actually here in this room .PERIOD
And then the guy in the Exxon uniform stepped out ,COMMA and we realized it was okay .PERIOD
So ,COMMA what I'm going to talk to you about now is :COLON what do we have to do this time ?QUESTIONMARK
We need to kind of get down and do the gritty work of reducing our dependence upon this fuel and these molecules .PERIOD
Cynthia Schneider :COLON These programs are reaching incredibly deeply into society .PERIOD
People become so engaged that they have volunteers ,COMMA just like political volunteers anyway ,COMMA who fan out over the countryside ,COMMA campaigning for their candidate .PERIOD
One of them ,COMMA Lima Sahar ,COMMA is a Pashtun from Kandahar ,COMMA a very conservative part of the country .PERIOD
It turns out that competition and winning is a universal human value .PERIOD
And then a thought came across my mind :COLON if things go pear-shaped on this swim ,COMMA how long will it take for my frozen body to sink the four and a half kilometers to the bottom of the ocean ?QUESTIONMARK
Nearly two billion people -- so one in three people on this earth -- rely on the water from the Himalayas .PERIOD
I carried on for another five or six strokes ,COMMA and then I had nothing in my body ,COMMA and I went down to the bottom of the lake .PERIOD
It is the most frightening and panicky feeling that you can have .PERIOD
And there ,COMMA we sat down ,COMMA and we did a debrief about what had gone wrong there on Mt .PERIOD Everest .PERIOD
Take some time to rest and think about things .PERIOD
I say ,COMMA I do hardware ,COMMA because it sort of conveniently encompasses everything I do .PERIOD
So ,COMMA this talk is going to be about how do we make things and what are the new ways that we're going to make things in the future .PERIOD
And I was laughing about this with the very smart colleagues I have ,COMMA and said ,COMMA You know ,COMMA well ,COMMA if I have to talk about the future ,COMMA what is it ?QUESTIONMARK
Literally ,COMMA think of proteins as subroutines that you can string together to execute a program .PERIOD
And this is being built by a group of students at Zurich for a design competition in biology .PERIOD
Took me six years at MIT ,COMMA and about that many pages to describe what I was doing ,COMMA and it took him one page .PERIOD And so this is our muse Tucker .PERIOD
And the ribosome here is another little computer that helps in the translation of the proteins .PERIOD
These are little mechanical computers .PERIOD
These are five-state state machines .PERIOD
In a neutral state ,COMMA they won't bind at all .PERIOD
So now I'm going to show you the hands-free ,COMMA autonomous self-replication .PERIOD
So ,COMMA Neil Gershenfeld showed you this video on Wednesday ,COMMA I believe ,COMMA but I'll show you again .PERIOD
And how do we think about materials and structure ,COMMA sort of as an information and computation problem ?QUESTIONMARK
This is a machine where you literally define a boundary condition .PERIOD
We will be an overwhelmingly urban species .PERIOD
And the correlation ,COMMA of course ,COMMA is that denser places tend to have lower emissions -- which isn't really all that difficult to figure out ,COMMA if you think about it .PERIOD
And we're basically using mobility to get the access we need .PERIOD
And it is possible ,COMMA of course ,COMMA to increase the density of the communities around us .PERIOD
Do they even take the very waste matter that we have from food and fiber and so forth ,COMMA and turn it back into soil and sequester carbon -- take carbon out of the air in the process of using our cities ?QUESTIONMARK
Because right now ,COMMA our economy by and large operates as Paul Hawken said ,COMMA by stealing the future ,COMMA selling it in the present and calling it GDP .PERIOD
President Clinton ,COMMA if you're here ,COMMA thank you .PERIOD
Well ,COMMA why has violence declined ?QUESTIONMARK No one really knows ,COMMA but I have read four explanations ,COMMA all of which ,COMMA I think ,COMMA have some grain of plausibility .PERIOD The first is ,COMMA maybe Thomas Hobbes got it right .PERIOD He was the one who said that life in a state of nature was solitary ,COMMA poor ,COMMA nasty ,COMMA brutish and short .PERIOD Not because ,COMMA he argued ,COMMA humans have some primordial thirst for blood or aggressive instinct or territorial imperative ,COMMA but because of the logic of anarchy .PERIOD In a state of anarchy ,COMMA there's a constant temptation to invade your neighbors preemptively ,COMMA before they invade you .PERIOD More recently ,COMMA Thomas Schelling gives the analogy of a homeowner who hears a rustling in the basement .PERIOD Being a good American ,COMMA he has a pistol in the nightstand ,COMMA pulls out his gun ,COMMA and walks down the stairs .PERIOD
It removes the need for a hair trigger for retaliation to make your deterrent threat credible .PERIOD And therefore ,COMMA it would lead to a state of peace .PERIOD Eisner -- the man who plotted the homicide rates that you failed to see in the earlier slide -- argued that the timing of the decline of homicide in Europe coincided with the rise of centralized states .PERIOD
This was an argument from the political scientist James Payne .PERIOD
Because we have been doing something right ,COMMA and it sure would be good to find out what it is .PERIOD
We learned it in college .PERIOD
We have Liberia .PERIOD We have Congo .PERIOD
Income per person .PERIOD I can put that here .PERIOD
That's why we are so scared about flu ,COMMA isn't it ?QUESTIONMARK
And especially ,COMMA it's interesting to see China and the United States during 200 years ,COMMA because I have my oldest son now working for Google ,COMMA after Google acquired this software .PERIOD
Mao Tse-Tung eventually brought health to China ,COMMA and then he died ,COMMA and then Deng Xiaoping started this amazing move forward .PERIOD
And I come now ,COMMA into projections ,COMMA but I have to stop at the door of Lehman Brothers there ,COMMA you know ,COMMA because -- that's where the projections are not valid any longer .PERIOD
East Europe ,COMMA Latin America ,COMMA and OECD countries .PERIOD
It's Lincoln here ,COMMA advancing them .PERIOD
And we have countries all this way .PERIOD
And what has happened in the world ?QUESTIONMARK
We used to boast about fast social progress .PERIOD
That's where we were ,COMMA 1900 .PERIOD
And you can see it's not that easy ,COMMA that it is war which caused this .PERIOD
And here ,COMMA in Zambia ,COMMA there is peace .PERIOD
If I split Tanzania in its income ,COMMA the richer 20 percent in Tanzania has more HIV than the poorest one .PERIOD
And it's really different within each country .PERIOD
It's similar to the pellagra epidemic in Mississippi in the ' 30 s .PERIOD
We have seen it here in Mozambique .PERIOD
That used to be the illegal diamond trade ,COMMA from the UNITA-dominated area in Angola .PERIOD
Don't get confused of the progress of the emerging economies and the great capacity of people in the middle income countries and in peaceful low income countries .PERIOD
I am a reformed marketer ,COMMA and I now work in international development .PERIOD
He said there's just not in demand .PERIOD
And as a marketer ,COMMA I found that curious .PERIOD
And it turns out that there are three main messages used by the donor agencies for these condoms :COLON fear ,COMMA financing and fidelity .PERIOD
They package it with the red ribbon that reminds us of HIV ,COMMA put it in boxes that remind you who paid for them ,COMMA show pictures of your wife or husband and tell you to protect them or to act prudently .PERIOD
And so the lesson is this :COLON it doesn't really matter what you're selling ;SEMICOLON you just have to think about who is your customer ,COMMA and what are the messages that are going to get them to change their behavior .PERIOD
It was before the avian flu had reached Europe .PERIOD
I'll see what I can do .PERIOD OK ?QUESTIONMARK
Generations go by ,COMMA somebody says ,COMMA hey ,COMMA why don't we put it on a stick ?QUESTIONMARK
Just absolutely delights the little ones .PERIOD
Point is :COLON there's obviously collaboration and organization going on beyond national bounds .PERIOD
A lot of forms of non-zero-sum behavior in the realm of economics and so on in everyday life often leads to cooperation .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA this sounds like an intrinsically upbeat worldview in a way ,COMMA because when you think of non-zero ,COMMA you think win-win ,COMMA you know ,COMMA that's good .PERIOD Well ,COMMA there are a few reasons that actually it's not intrinsically upbeat .PERIOD
I have a whole global governance sermon that I will spare you right now ,COMMA because I don't think that's going to be enough anyway ,COMMA although it's essential .PERIOD
That is to say -- -- thank you ,COMMA thank you .PERIOD That is to say ,COMMA remember :COLON my whole view of morality is that it boils down to self-interest .PERIOD
Doing the best I can ,COMMA OK .PERIOD
It was kind of along these lines ,COMMA and the allegation was that I have ,COMMA quote ,COMMA affection for terrorists .PERIOD
And a kind of saving higher moral level ,COMMA something that kind of literally saves the world .PERIOD
Yahweh is our Savior means He has saved the nation of Israel ,COMMA which at the time ,COMMA was a pretty high-level social organization .PERIOD
I am very ,COMMA very happy to be amidst some of the most -- the lights are really disturbing my eyes and they're reflecting on my glasses .PERIOD
Because despair ,COMMA civil war ,COMMA hunger and famine ,COMMA although they're part and parcel of our African reality ,COMMA they are not the only reality .PERIOD
But they also succeed at the job of entrepreneurship .PERIOD
Support private investment in Africa ,COMMA both domestic and foreign .PERIOD
Which country is that ?QUESTIONMARK
The productive margin in our governments' search for revenue does not lie in the domestic economy ,COMMA it lies with international donors .PERIOD
The IMF ,COMMA the World Bank ,COMMA and the cartel of good intentions in the world has taken over our rights as citizens ,COMMA and therefore what our governments are doing ,COMMA because they depend on aid ,COMMA is to listen to international creditors rather than their own citizens .PERIOD
They talk to international donors .PERIOD
Where has all the aid gone ?QUESTIONMARK
Uganda's recurrent expenditure -- by recurrent what do I mean ?QUESTIONMARK
The editor of Discover told us 10 of them ,COMMA I'm going to give you the eleventh .PERIOD
So they came to me -- CNN -- and they said ,COMMA Professor Seligman ,COMMA would you tell us about the state of psychology today ?QUESTIONMARK
Look ,COMMA Doctor Seligman ,COMMA we can see you're really not comfortable in this medium .PERIOD
Not good enough .PERIOD And that's what I'm going to be talking about .PERIOD
It should be just as concerned with building strength as with repairing damage .PERIOD
And starting about six years ago ,COMMA we asked about extremely happy people .PERIOD
That's what Aristotle was talking about .PERIOD
The first life is the pleasant life and it's simply ,COMMA as best we can find it ,COMMA it's having as many of the pleasures as you can ,COMMA as much positive emotion as you can ,COMMA and learning the skills -- savoring ,COMMA mindfulness -- that amplify them ,COMMA that stretch them over time and space .PERIOD
In two of the three great arenas of life ,COMMA by the time Len was 30 ,COMMA Len was enormously successful .PERIOD The first arena was work .PERIOD
It turned out that -- Len grew up in Long Island and he played football and watched football ,COMMA and played bridge -- Len is in the bottom five percent of what we call positive affectivities .PERIOD
When he walks onto the floor of the American Exchange at 930 in the morning ,COMMA time stops for him .PERIOD And it stops till the closing bell .PERIOD
And we think there's a recipe for it ,COMMA and it's knowing what your highest strengths are .PERIOD
Just one example .PERIOD One person I worked with was a bagger at Genuardi's .PERIOD
Her highest strength was social intelligence ,COMMA so she re-crafted bagging to make the encounter with her the social highlight of every customer's day .PERIOD
Now obviously she failed .PERIOD
What you get out of that is not smiley-ness .PERIOD
I'd like you to remember someone who did something enormously important that changed your life in a good direction ,COMMA and who you never properly thanked .PERIOD
I hope all of you have such a person .PERIOD
But they were empty .PERIOD
And so ,COMMA the parallel thing holds with technology ,COMMA entertainment and design ,COMMA I believe .PERIOD
So in conclusion ,COMMA the eleventh reason for optimism ,COMMA in addition to the space elevator ,COMMA is that I think with technology ,COMMA entertainment and design ,COMMA we can actually increase the amount of tonnage of human happiness on the planet .PERIOD
And if technology can ,COMMA in the next decade or two ,COMMA increase the pleasant life ,COMMA the good life and the meaningful life ,COMMA it will be good enough .PERIOD
Here's an example .PERIOD
Four years ago ,COMMA I was at the beach with my son ,COMMA and he was learning how to swim in this relatively soft surf of the Delaware beaches .PERIOD
So ,COMMA this represents -- this is a cross-sample of some remarkable images taken by some of the world's greatest photojournalists ,COMMA working at the very top of their craft -- except one .PERIOD
But to be a great photojournalist ,COMMA you have to have more than just one or two great photographs in you .PERIOD
But the centerpiece species of Zakouma are the elephants .PERIOD
And instead ,COMMA created a story that touched our audiences deeply .PERIOD
Instead of just knowledge of this park ,COMMA he created an understanding and an empathy for the elephants ,COMMA the rangers and the many issues surrounding human-wildlife conflicts .PERIOD
He saw that this was a living and breathing and vital part of how the entire urban area functioned .PERIOD
We also want to look for solutions .PERIOD
Jim took what could have been a straight-up medical science story and gave it a human dimension that touched our readers deeply .PERIOD
But there are also times when photographers simply encounter things that are ,COMMA when it comes down to it ,COMMA just plain fun .PERIOD
Thank you .PERIOD
And my father was a soldier ,COMMA and my uncle was a fisherman and also a poacher .PERIOD
For three times ,COMMA I applied to biomedical science ,COMMA to be a doctor .PERIOD
With the end of the dictatorship regime of Mobutu Sese Seko ,COMMA that most of you know ,COMMA life became very ,COMMA very difficult .PERIOD
So they started fleeing from the east to the west .PERIOD
All my friends said ,COMMA we are leaving because we are a target .PERIOD
But I'm not going to the east ,COMMA because I don't know Swahili .PERIOD
Because he's Pygmy ,COMMA he knows how to track elephants in the forest .PERIOD
They came to told me ,COMMA I have to save him .PERIOD
Everywhere there has been constant extraction of mineral ,COMMA killing animals ,COMMA the logging timbers and so on .PERIOD
That is Coltan extraction ,COMMA gold mining .PERIOD
We have to do it ,COMMA because to let our movement advance .PERIOD
After a week ,COMMA we celebrated the birthday of that Okapi ,COMMA they killed an elephant ,COMMA just 50 meters to the area where the zoo ,COMMA where Okapi was born .PERIOD
I devoted half of it to rebuild the herbarium ,COMMA because we didn't have good infrastructure to start plants .PERIOD
But is gun industries a tool to rebuild ,COMMA or is it a game ?QUESTIONMARK
And they can't go even to university .PERIOD
Thank you ,COMMA thank you .PERIOD
One of the biggest challenges in computer graphics has been being able to create a photo-real ,COMMA digital human face .PERIOD
And one of the reasons it is so difficult is that ,COMMA unlike aliens and dinosaurs ,COMMA we look at human faces every day .PERIOD
We shoot all of these photographs in about three seconds .PERIOD
If we zoom in on this photograph right here ,COMMA we can see it's a really nice photograph to have of her ,COMMA because she is lit from absolutely everywhere at the same time to get a nice image of her facial texture .PERIOD
We're just seeing the coarse-scale geometry here .PERIOD
And thank you very much .PERIOD
We're roughly two days from the entrance at that point .PERIOD

These are the tuna ,COMMA the billfish and the sharks .PERIOD
But the truth is we're way too efficient at catching them ,COMMA and their stocks have collapsed worldwide .PERIOD
So this is the true cost of a shrimp dinner ,COMMA maybe seven or eight shrimp and 10 pounds of other animals that had to die in the process .PERIOD
I also wanted to focus on the shark fishing industry because ,COMMA currently on planet Earth ,COMMA we're killing over 100 million sharks every single year .PERIOD
But before I went out to photograph this component ,COMMA I sort of wrestled with the notion of how do you make a picture of a dead shark that will resonate with readers You know ,COMMA I think there's still a lot of people out there who think the only good shark is a dead shark .PERIOD
One of the locations was this place called Tiger Beach ,COMMA in the northern Bahamas where tiger sharks aggregate in shallow water .PERIOD
I also searched on this story for the elusive great hammerhead ,COMMA an animal that really hadn't been photographed much until maybe about seven or 10 years ago .PERIOD
But this is crucial habitat and it's where they spend the first two ,COMMA three years of their lives ,COMMA until they're big enough to go out on the rest of the reef .PERIOD
I actually jumped in and photographed this ,COMMA and with the fisherman's permission ,COMMA I cut the turtle out ,COMMA and it was able to swim free .PERIOD

Remember I'm the black kid from the ' 60 s who got his life saved with ceramics .PERIOD

So ,COMMA he jumped in the van ,COMMA he went to Miss Jones' house and said ,COMMA Miss Jones ,COMMA I knew you wanted to come to your kid's art opening but you probably didn't have a ride .PERIOD
And there is no statistical difference between the white parents and the black parents .PERIOD
She said ,COMMA Well ,COMMA I work for a company called Hewlett-Packard .PERIOD

And this is what I want to do when I grow up .PERIOD
This is in a place called San Francisco .PERIOD

So ,COMMA 10 times more bacterial cells than human cells on a human being .PERIOD
At the best ,COMMA you're 10 percent human ,COMMA but more likely about one percent human ,COMMA depending on which of these metrics you like .PERIOD
And so we wanted to think if there couldn't be a different way that bacteria live .PERIOD
What you're looking at on this slide is just a person from my lab holding a flask of a liquid culture of a bacterium ,COMMA a harmless beautiful bacterium that comes from the ocean ,COMMA named Vibrio fischeri .PERIOD
We just took the picture by turning the lights off in the room ,COMMA and this is what we see .PERIOD
But when they grew to a certain cell number all the bacteria turned on light simultaneously .PERIOD
The question that we had is how can bacteria ,COMMA these primitive organisms ,COMMA tell the difference from times when they're alone ,COMMA and times when they're in a community ,COMMA and then all do something together .PERIOD
This is like the stealth bomber of the ocean .PERIOD
And then as the cells grow ,COMMA they're all releasing that molecule into the environment ,COMMA so there's lots of molecule there .PERIOD
But the one that's probably the most important to you is virulence .PERIOD
This is the Vibrio fischeri molecule .PERIOD
So then we started to look at other bacteria ,COMMA and these are just a smattering of the molecules that we've discovered .PERIOD
The left-hand part of the molecule is identical in every single species of bacteria .PERIOD
What that does is to confer exquisite species specificities to these languages .PERIOD
Each molecule fits into its partner receptor and no other .PERIOD
Each bacteria uses a particular molecule that's its language that allows it to count its own siblings .PERIOD
Anywhere on your body ,COMMA it looks pretty much like this ,COMMA and what I hope you can see is that there's all kinds of bacteria there .PERIOD
Couldn't these be new kinds of antibiotics ?QUESTIONMARK
And so now of course we have this global problem in infectious diseases .PERIOD
The first one is we've targeted the intraspecies communication system .PERIOD
I hope that what you've learned is that bacteria can distinguish self from other .PERIOD
This is exactly what happens in your body .PERIOD
But then ,COMMA to finish with a plug for all the good and miraculous bacteria that live on the Earth ,COMMA we've also made pro-quorum sensing molecules .PERIOD
Remember you have these 10 times or more bacterial cells in you or on you ,COMMA keeping you healthy .PERIOD
So I'm really a basic scientist ,COMMA not a clinician ,COMMA but in the last year and a half I've started to switch over ,COMMA to use what we've been learning about these patterns of activity to develop prosthetic devices ,COMMA and what I wanted to do today is show you an example of this .PERIOD
It's really our first foray into this .PERIOD
Like this pattern of pulses here actually means baby's face ,COMMA and so when the brain gets this pattern of pulses ,COMMA it knows that what was out there was a baby's face ,COMMA and if it got a different pattern it would know that what was out there was ,COMMA say ,COMMA a dog ,COMMA or another pattern would be a house .PERIOD
So this is what we've been working on ,COMMA and this is what our prosthetic does .PERIOD
So a completely blind retina ,COMMA even one with no front-end circuitry at all ,COMMA no photoreceptors ,COMMA can now send out normal signals ,COMMA signals that the brain can understand .PERIOD
And so with the standard method ,COMMA the cells do fire ,COMMA they just don't fire in the normal firing patterns because they don't have the right code .PERIOD
This is just actually the first one that we tried .PERIOD
So it's different from the motor prosthetics where you're communicating from the brain to a device .PERIOD Here we have to communicate from the outside world into the brain and be understood ,COMMA and be understood by the brain .PERIOD
You can just call it out .PERIOD
Who else ?QUESTIONMARK

That's part of the game of golf ?QUESTIONMARK
Charlie ,COMMA what do you say to Warren ?QUESTIONMARK
Warren :COLON I am not a golfer .PERIOD
He wouldn't have granted the cart ,COMMA and he had a very interesting dissent .PERIOD
But since it is the very nature of a game to have no object except amusement ,COMMA that is ,COMMA what distinguishes games from productive activity ,COMMA it is quite impossible to say that any of a game's arbitrary rules is essential .PERIOD
First ,COMMA no real sports fan would talk that way .PERIOD
On the face of it ,COMMA it seemed to be -- this debate about the golf cart -- an argument about fairness ,COMMA what's an unfair advantage .PERIOD
So if golfing is the kind of game that can be played while riding around in a golf cart ,COMMA it would be hard to confer on the golfing greats the status that we confer ,COMMA the honor and recognition that goes to truly great athletes .PERIOD
How many here favor the first policy :COLON the state should recognize traditional marriage only ?QUESTIONMARK
I'm going to talk about why we have to get our shit together ,COMMA and actually talk about this a bit more than we do .PERIOD
That was easy .PERIOD OK .PERIOD
OK .PERIOD Hands up :COLON anyone in the audience who's not sure whether malaria is a good thing or a bad thing ?QUESTIONMARK
You know ,COMMA a lot of people said ,COMMA Well ,COMMA you know ,COMMA city boys have no business telling us rural types what to do with our time .PERIOD
It's a global trance .PERIOD
But the question is ,COMMA are they so dangerous -- these risks of doing something about aging -- that they outweigh the downside of doing the opposite ,COMMA namely ,COMMA leaving aging as it is ?QUESTIONMARK
People worry about overpopulation ;SEMICOLON they say ,COMMA Well ,COMMA if we fix aging ,COMMA no one's going to die to speak of ,COMMA or at least the death toll is going to be much lower ,COMMA only from crossing St .PERIOD Giles carelessly .PERIOD
This pro-aging trance is what stops us from agitating about these things .PERIOD
But it isn't .PERIOD
So ,COMMA these trajectories here are basically how we would expect people to live ,COMMA in terms of remaining life expectancy ,COMMA as measured by their health ,COMMA for given ages that they were at the time that these therapies arrive .PERIOD
But if you're only 50 ,COMMA then there's a chance that you might be able to pull out of the dive and ,COMMA you know -- -- eventually get through this and start becoming biologically younger in a meaningful sense ,COMMA in terms of your youthfulness ,COMMA both physical and mental ,COMMA and in terms of your risk of death from age-related causes .PERIOD
And of course ,COMMA if you're a bit younger than that ,COMMA then you're never really even going to get near to being fragile enough to die of age-related causes .PERIOD
And that's quite a thought .PERIOD
So ,COMMA in other words ,COMMA we add two years -- we treble their remaining lifespan ,COMMA starting from the point that we started the therapies .PERIOD
So we're likely to end up with a very strong change in people's attitudes ,COMMA and of course that has enormous implications .PERIOD
Because the critical thing about this is that even though the damage only eventually causes pathology ,COMMA the damage itself is caused ongoing-ly throughout life ,COMMA starting before we're born .PERIOD
And the reason it's a losing battle is because the damage is continuing to accumulate .PERIOD
So ,COMMA these seven things were all under discussion in gerontology a long time ago and that is pretty good news ,COMMA because it means that ,COMMA you know ,COMMA we've come a long way in biology in these 20 years ,COMMA so the fact that we haven't extended this list is a pretty good indication that there's no extension to be done .PERIOD
And you know what happened .PERIOD
But ,COMMA I mean ,COMMA look -- how long does it take to spend that on the war in Iraq ?QUESTIONMARK
And I think we know how to do it .PERIOD And I'll stop there .PERIOD

So we like to see profits ,COMMA plus positive social and environmental benefits ,COMMA when we invest .PERIOD
Now that we've had all that happen ,COMMA and we have all this data out there telling us that it's much better to have diversity around the decision-making tables ,COMMA will we see business and finance change ?QUESTIONMARK
I want to see more revolutionary thinking ,COMMA and I remain hopeful .PERIOD

How can we get government to combine properly with these private foundations ,COMMA with the international organizations ,COMMA and with our private sector .PERIOD

That blood flow causes an increase in local blood to that area with a deoxyhemoglobin change in concentration .PERIOD
Charles Limb :COLON This is a plastic MIDI piano keyboard that we use for the jazz experiments .PERIOD

And I've listened to that solo 200 times ,COMMA and I still like it .PERIOD
And so we had this focal area called the medial prefrontal cortex that went way up in activity .PERIOD
We had this broad patch of area called the lateral prefrontal cortex that went way down in activity ,COMMA and I'll summarize that for you here .PERIOD

The fact that we do it over and over again lets you acclimate to your surroundings .PERIOD
So how do you study rap scientifically ?QUESTIONMARK
With this big screen ,COMMA you can all rap with me .PERIOD Okay ?QUESTIONMARK
He's just memorized a rhyme for us .PERIOD
And what we see ,COMMA we do see language areas lighting up ,COMMA but then -- eyes closed -- when you are free-styling versus memorizing ,COMMA you've got major visual areas lighting up .PERIOD
You have heightened brain activity when you're doing a comparable task ,COMMA when that one task is creative and the other task is memorized .PERIOD
I mean ,COMMA don't get me wrong .PERIOD Calculus is an important subject .PERIOD
And every student who studies math ,COMMA science ,COMMA engineering ,COMMA economics ,COMMA they should definitely learn calculus by the end of their freshman year of college .PERIOD
It's understanding data .PERIOD
Look ,COMMA the world has changed from analog to digital .PERIOD
The majority of our functional brain is distributed over the outer surface layer of the brain ,COMMA and to increase the area that's available for mental capacity ,COMMA the brain surface is highly folded .PERIOD
Our breakthrough was to create an algorithm that unfolds the cortex ,COMMA so that we can map the signals closer to its source ,COMMA and therefore making it capable of working across a mass population .PERIOD
The second challenge is the actual device for observing brainwaves .PERIOD
With neutral ,COMMA there's nothing in particular that Evan needs to do .PERIOD
It takes eight seconds to do this ,COMMA and now that that's done ,COMMA we can choose a movement-based action .PERIOD
So Evan ,COMMA choose something that you can visualize clearly in your mind .PERIOD
So the idea here now is that Evan needs to imagine the object coming forward into the screen ,COMMA and there's a progress bar that will scroll across the screen while he's doing that .PERIOD
The first time ,COMMA nothing will happen ,COMMA because the system has no idea how he thinks about pull .PERIOD
So :COLON one ,COMMA two ,COMMA three ,COMMA go .PERIOD
Okay .PERIOD
Ah ,COMMA good job !EXCLAMATIONMARK

So what you want to do -- at least with movement-based actions ,COMMA we do that all the time ,COMMA so you can visualize it .PERIOD
So I'd like to show you a few examples ,COMMA because there are many possible applications for this new interface .PERIOD
And bed nets have an effect on the epidemic ,COMMA but you're never going to make it extinct with bed nets .PERIOD
We could spend hours going over this .PERIOD
It creates a very high peak power and it lets you do all kinds of interesting things ;SEMICOLON in particular ,COMMA it lets you find hemozoin .PERIOD
And using both this technique and other optical techniques ,COMMA we think we can make those diagnostics .PERIOD
We also have another hemozoin-oriented therapy for malaria :COLON a way ,COMMA in acute cases ,COMMA to actually take the malaria parasite and filter it out of the blood system .PERIOD
You can give drug administration .PERIOD
We have all of the precipitation data and the temperature data .PERIOD
That's very important because the humidity and precipitation tell you whether you've got standing pools of water for the mosquitoes to breed .PERIOD
So that sets the stage on which you do this .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA one of the ways you can make them not fly is with DDT .PERIOD
In 1935 ,COMMA there were 150000 cases a year of malaria in the United States ,COMMA but DDT and a massive public health effort managed to squelch it .PERIOD
Audience :COLON Yeah !EXCLAMATIONMARK
Nathan Myhrvold :COLON Okay ,COMMA so our legal department prepared a disclaimer ,COMMA and here it is .PERIOD

I'm taking the temperature of the canal outside ,COMMA pumping it through the heat exchange mechanism ,COMMA it's turning through these amazing sails on the roof ,COMMA and that ,COMMA in turn ,COMMA is falling softly onto the people in the restaurant ,COMMA cooling them ,COMMA or heating them ,COMMA as the need may be .PERIOD
In the canal ,COMMA which is just outside the restaurant ,COMMA there is hundreds of meters of coil piping .PERIOD
He's growing all his own fruit ,COMMA and that's fantastic .PERIOD
So you've got to watch your space for that .PERIOD
Okay .PERIOD So this is my next project .PERIOD
I mean ,COMMA the whole thing is is super-sustainable .PERIOD
And no one's doing that just yet .PERIOD
This is a herd ,COMMA and it is built according to genetical codes .PERIOD
In fact ,COMMA it's a new invention of the wheel .PERIOD
In fact ,COMMA this is better than a wheel ,COMMA because when you try to drive with your bicycle on the beach ,COMMA you will notice it's very hard to do .PERIOD
OK .PERIOD Good .PERIOD
So as soon it has been to the sea ,COMMA it changes the pattern of zeroes and ones here ,COMMA and it knows always where it is on the beach .PERIOD So it's very simple brain .PERIOD
So it's a sort of imagination of the simple world of the beach animal .PERIOD
We did Haemophilus influenzae and then the smallest genome of a self-replicating organism ,COMMA that of Mycoplasma genitalium .PERIOD
In 2003 ,COMMA we published our first success .PERIOD
So Ham Smith and Clyde Hutchison developed some new methods for making error-free DNA at a small level .PERIOD
And we can walk through the reasons for that ,COMMA but basically the small cell took on the order of one to two months to get results from ,COMMA whereas the larger ,COMMA faster-growing cell takes only two days .PERIOD
It's an amazing step forward ,COMMA but we had a problem because now we had the bacterial chromosomes growing in yeast .PERIOD
And we thought this would be a great test bed for learning how to get chromosomes out of yeast and transplant them .PERIOD
We narrowed it down to one fragment ;SEMICOLON we sequenced it and found just one base pair had been deleted in an essential gene .PERIOD
we got a text from Dan saying that ,COMMA now ,COMMA the first blue colonies existed .PERIOD
So early on ,COMMA we developed the notion of putting in watermarks in the DNA to absolutely make clear that the DNA was synthetic .PERIOD
It's significant to us .PERIOD
So when you see how long it took to get an H 1 N 1 vaccine out ,COMMA we think we can shorten that process quite substantially .PERIOD
You may have heard about the Koran's idea of paradise being 72 virgins ,COMMA and I promise I will come back to those virgins .PERIOD
It's just 29 words in Arabic ,COMMA but anywhere from 65 to 72 in translation .PERIOD
But all is not lost in translation .PERIOD
And that number 72 never appears .PERIOD
There are no 72 virgins in the Koran .PERIOD
They all live in colonies consisting of one or a few queens ,COMMA and then all the ants you see walking around are sterile female workers .PERIOD
Here's my study site .PERIOD This is really a picture of ants ,COMMA and the rabbit just happens to be there .PERIOD
Ants never make more ants ;SEMICOLON colonies make more colonies .PERIOD
And this shows a recently virgin queen .PERIOD Here's her wings .PERIOD
She lays eggs ,COMMA she feeds the larvae -- so an ant starts as an egg ,COMMA then it's a larva .PERIOD
So ,COMMA things happen to an ant colony .PERIOD
When it rains in the summer ,COMMA it floods in the desert .PERIOD
And that's the process that I call task allocation .PERIOD
That is ,COMMA that there are chambers inside ,COMMA they line the walls of the chambers with moist soil and it dries to a kind of an adobe-like surface in it .PERIOD
And finally ,COMMA the midden workers put some kind of territorial chemical in the garbage .PERIOD
So ,COMMA an ant starts out somewhere near the queen .PERIOD
The queen's in there somewhere ;SEMICOLON she just lays eggs .PERIOD
So just to reinforce that what you might have thought about ant queens isn't true -- you know ,COMMA even if the queen did have the intelligence to send chemical messages through this whole network of chambers to tell the ants outside what to do ,COMMA there is no way that such messages could make it in time to see the shifts in the allocation of workers that we actually see outside the nest .PERIOD
We started out with model airplane paint and then we found these wonderful little Japanese markers ,COMMA and they work really well .PERIOD
And so just to summarize the result ,COMMA well it turns out that yes ,COMMA the different tasks are interdependent .PERIOD
And the second result ,COMMA which was surprising to a lot of people ,COMMA was that ants actually switch tasks .PERIOD
The same ant doesn't do the same task over and over its whole life .PERIOD
This process changes with colony age ,COMMA and it changes like this .PERIOD
Instead ,COMMA something about the organization must be changing as the colony gets older .PERIOD
And what we're learning is that an ant uses the pattern of its antennal contacts ,COMMA the rate at which it meets ants of other tasks ,COMMA in deciding what to do .PERIOD
And we've just recently demonstrated this by putting extract of hydrocarbons on little glass beads ,COMMA and dropping the beads gently down into the nest entrance at the right rate .PERIOD
So I want now to show you a bit of film -- and this will start out ,COMMA first of all ,COMMA showing you the nest entrance .PERIOD
This is taken through a fiber optics microscope .PERIOD It's down inside the nest .PERIOD
Each ant ,COMMA then ,COMMA as it comes back in ,COMMA is contacting other ants .PERIOD
So ,COMMA what's interesting about this system is that it's messy .PERIOD
Again ,COMMA I don't want to say that this kind of haphazard pattern of interactions produces a factory that works with the precision and efficiency of clockwork .PERIOD
That we can take the whole idea that gave birth to the Internet and bring it down to the physical world in this Internet Zero ,COMMA this internet of devices .PERIOD
Unlike this screen where the dots are placed carefully ,COMMA this is a raw material .PERIOD
This was just a proof of principle he did of tiles that interact magnetically ,COMMA where you write a code ,COMMA much like protein folding ,COMMA that specifies their structure .PERIOD
But I had a problem .PERIOD Once I had all these machines ,COMMA I was spending too much time teaching students to use them .PERIOD
When a user screams into scream buddy ,COMMA their scream is silenced .PERIOD
But you don't use it for inventory and payroll ;SEMICOLON DEC is now twice bankrupt .PERIOD You don't need personal fabrication in the home to buy what you can buy because you can buy it .PERIOD
And the way you close it is not IT for the masses but IT development for the masses .PERIOD
You can see it in their face ,COMMA just this joy of ,COMMA I can do it .PERIOD
We designed a network sensor ,COMMA and kids would show up and refuse to leave the lab .PERIOD
This is late at ,COMMA you know ,COMMA 11 o'clock at night and I think I was the only person surprised when what she built worked the first time .PERIOD
And ,COMMA again ,COMMA that was just for the joy of it .PERIOD
And then ,COMMA in turn ,COMMA businesses started to grow ,COMMA like making these antennas .PERIOD
We're learning more from them than we're giving them .PERIOD
I was showing my kids in a Fab Lab how to use it .PERIOD
Real invention is happening in these labs .PERIOD
PDPs came between mainframes and minicomputers .PERIOD
It was there because they wanted to find animals in the mountains but it outgrew it ,COMMA so they built this extraordinary village for the lab .PERIOD
If this room full of heroes is just clever enough ,COMMA you can solve the problems .PERIOD
The message coming from the Fab Labs is that the other five billion people on the planet aren't just technical sinks ;SEMICOLON they're sources .PERIOD
That has got to be stopped .PERIOD
Somehow that doesn't seem right .PERIOD
So here we are using 20 million barrels a day -- producing eight ,COMMA importing 12 ,COMMA and from the 12 ,COMMA five comes from OPEC .PERIOD
Now I had people in Washington last week told me ,COMMA he said ,COMMA The Saudis can produce the oil for five dollars a barrel .PERIOD
We're headed to natural gas .PERIOD
Run it through the separator and you're ready to use it .PERIOD
Natural gas will fit all of those .PERIOD
It will replace or be able to be used for that .PERIOD
So I have tried to target on where we use the natural gas .PERIOD
And where I've targeted is on the heavy-duty trucks .PERIOD
There are eight million of them .PERIOD
I'm back to theorist again .PERIOD
So there's nothing going on that impresses me in Washington on that plan ,COMMA other than I'm trying to focus on that eight million 18 -wheelers .PERIOD
Thank you .PERIOD
That'll make you abandon something .PERIOD
I'm a geologist ,COMMA got out of school in ' 51 ,COMMA and I've been in the industry my entire life .PERIOD
I'm not a big natural gas producer .PERIOD
You've made the money you need .PERIOD
Does that make sense ?QUESTIONMARK
The government is not successful on these things .PERIOD
But Chris ,COMMA I think where we're headed ,COMMA the long-term ,COMMA I don't mind going back to nuclear .PERIOD
There isn't anything wrong with nuke .PERIOD
TBP :COLON Fracking ?QUESTIONMARK What is fracking ?QUESTIONMARK
I mean seriously ,COMMA the Department of Energy did not have anything to do with fracking .PERIOD
The first frack job was in ' 47 .PERIOD
There's no problems .PERIOD
If someone comes to you with a plan that really looks like it might be part of this solution ,COMMA are you ready to invest in those technologies ,COMMA even if they aren't maximized for profits ,COMMA they might be maximized for the future health of the planet ?QUESTIONMARK
When you think about resilience and technology it's actually much easier .PERIOD
The Internet was also very real .PERIOD This is a real way for humans to communicate with each other .PERIOD It's a big deal .PERIOD
People on the East Coast in 1849 ,COMMA when they first started to get the news ,COMMA they thought ,COMMA Ah ,COMMA this isn't real .PERIOD
You had dotcom fever .PERIOD And you had gold fever .PERIOD
And they wouldn't let the other half out to go look for the first half because they were afraid they wouldn't come back .PERIOD
They had bad burn rate in the Gold Rush .PERIOD A very bad burn rate .PERIOD

So there's a much better analogy that allows you to be incredibly optimistic and that analogy is the electric industry .PERIOD
This was a huge -- as you would expect -- a huge capital build out .PERIOD
Well ,COMMA it was because that heavy infrastructure had already been laid down .PERIOD
They would -- each room typically had a light bulb socket at the top .PERIOD
And there's a rotor there -- that this motor is spinning .PERIOD
And they were really happy that the guy had a speakerphone because then they had to wait on hold for an hour to talk to somebody to give them an access code after they got there .PERIOD
Because ,COMMA you know ,COMMA resilience -- if you think of it in terms of the Gold Rush ,COMMA then you'd be pretty depressed right now because the last nugget of gold would be gone .PERIOD
She -- but you know ,COMMA if you really do believe that it's the very ,COMMA very beginning ,COMMA if you believe it's the 1908 Hurley washing machine ,COMMA then you're incredibly optimistic .PERIOD And I do think that that's where we are .PERIOD
The golden rule is great .PERIOD I'm a big supporter of both .PERIOD
In the beginning ,COMMA there was compassion ,COMMA and I mean not just when human beings first showed up ,COMMA but actually even before that .PERIOD
I warned you this was not going to be very warm and fuzzy .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA there's more good news that came along later in evolution ,COMMA a second kind of evolutionary logic .PERIOD
And so ,COMMA you wind up most easily extending compassion to friends and allies .PERIOD
So ,COMMA I hope I've got your attention with this promise of good news that may save the world .PERIOD
Basically ,COMMA a zero-sum game is the kind you're used to in sports ,COMMA where there's a winner and a loser .PERIOD
Either way ,COMMA your fortunes add up to zero .PERIOD That's a zero-sum game .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA if you're playing doubles ,COMMA then the person on your side of the net is in a non-zero-sum relationship with you ,COMMA because every point is either good for both of you -- positive ,COMMA win-win -- or bad for both of you ,COMMA it's lose-lose .PERIOD
The deployment of the golden rule most naturally happens along these non-zero-sum channels .PERIOD
With zero-sum channels you would expect something else .PERIOD
But it may .PERIOD And the good news is that history has naturally expanded these webs of non-zero-sumness ,COMMA these webs that can be these channels for compassion .PERIOD
That's the story of civilization .PERIOD
And also ,COMMA sometimes people don't recognize the non-zero-sum dynamics in the world .PERIOD
I think politicians can help foster non-zero-sum relationships ,COMMA Economic engagement is generally better than blockades and so on ,COMMA in this regard .PERIOD
If there's one thing I can encourage everyone to do ,COMMA politicians ,COMMA religious leaders ,COMMA and us ,COMMA it would be what I call expanding the moral imagination -- that is to say ,COMMA your ability to put yourself in the shoes of people in very different circumstances .PERIOD
Once upon a time ,COMMA I did a book called How Buildings Learn .PERIOD
So the design problem for today is going to be ,COMMA how do you house an eventual monumental clock like this so it can really tick ,COMMA save time beautifully for 100 centuries ?QUESTIONMARK
And it looked like a way to go ,COMMA until you start thinking about ,COMMA what does deep time do to a building ?QUESTIONMARK
This is the Parthenon .PERIOD It's only 2450 years old ,COMMA and look what happened to it .PERIOD
And now it's a pathetic ruin and no one even knows what it was used for .PERIOD
Underground in a place that's really solid .PERIOD
It's right on the eastern border of Nevada .PERIOD

The labyrinth is a concept ,COMMA it's like a twilight zone ,COMMA it's a place where it's difficult ,COMMA where you get disoriented ,COMMA maybe you get scared -- but you have to go through it if you're going to get to some kind of deep reintegration .PERIOD
The Hillis algorithm .PERIOD 10 factorial gives you that number .PERIOD
Something you didn't expect that caps what you did expect .PERIOD
And then ,COMMA how about a memento ?QUESTIONMARK Number seven .PERIOD
What are the elements that will most affect your ideas and decisions ?QUESTIONMARK
People think they're just the size of shrubs ,COMMA but that's not actually true .PERIOD
That's interesting .PERIOD
But it goes a mile-and-a-half in a straight line ,COMMA due east into the range ,COMMA into very interesting territory -- except that ,COMMA as you'll see when we go inside in a minute ,COMMA we were hoping for limestone but in there is just shale .PERIOD
Competent rock is rock that will hold itself up without any shoring .PERIOD
You may recognize a couple of the miners there .PERIOD
And Alexander Rose on the left there worked with a bunch of people from the National Park to survey the whole mine .PERIOD It's a mile deep .PERIOD
Kurt Bollacker and Alexander Rose designed a radically wireless station .PERIOD
But there's no bears ,COMMA and there's no poison oak ,COMMA and there's basically no people because this place has been empty for a long time .PERIOD
Well ,COMMA here's a potential approach .PERIOD
You need to come up the Lincoln Canyon .PERIOD
It's a secret passage .PERIOD It's like something from Tolkien .PERIOD
And then ,COMMA of course ,COMMA the next thing I hear is ,COMMA I've made it to the top .PERIOD You can see all of creation from up here .PERIOD
In fact ,COMMA there he is .PERIOD That's Alexander Rose .PERIOD
This discovery changed everything about our sense of these cliffs and what to do with them .PERIOD
So even with the slowing of the rotation of the earth and so on ,COMMA the clock will keep perfectly good time .PERIOD
So here we're looking from the south ,COMMA look north .PERIOD
Over on the eastern side it's gentle ,COMMA as you can see .PERIOD
And that's not snow -- that's what the white limestone looks like .PERIOD
Another is the experience in the mountain .PERIOD
And the third is the experience from the mountain ,COMMA which is really dominated by the view shed of the spring valley there behind Danny ,COMMA and if you look off to the right ,COMMA out there ,COMMA 15 miles across to the Schell Creek range .PERIOD
This is Rocky Mountain junipers that have been there for thousands of years .PERIOD
OK ,COMMA let's take one more look at the mountain itself .PERIOD
And this stone takes a perfect polish .PERIOD
Most of the amazingness of the clock we can borrow from the amazingness of the mountain .PERIOD
And often ,COMMA I'm driving in a taxi and I see a hole in a shirt ,COMMA or something that looks very interesting or pretty or functional in some way that I'd never seen happen before .PERIOD
I don't know where inspiration comes from .PERIOD

But I believe now that we're moving into a new age ,COMMA and that age The New York Times dubbed recently as the age of behavior .PERIOD
And these ideas and narratives that bump people across borders are increasingly beginning to affect the way in which people behave .PERIOD
If we look at Islamists ,COMMA if we look at the phenomenon of far-right fascists ,COMMA one thing they've been very good at ,COMMA one thing that they've actually been exceeding in ,COMMA is communicating across borders ,COMMA using technologies to organize themselves ,COMMA to propagate their message and to create truly global phenomena .PERIOD
But having been born in Essex ,COMMA at the age of 16 ,COMMA I joined an organization .PERIOD
By the age of 24 ,COMMA I found myself convicted in prison in Egypt ,COMMA being blacklisted from three countries in the world for attempting to overthrow their governments ,COMMA being subjected to torture in Egyptian jails and sentenced to five years as a prisoner of conscience .PERIOD

In certain countries ,COMMA mosque minarets are being banned .PERIOD
And why are democracy aspirants falling behind ?QUESTIONMARK
So the ideas and the narratives of Al-Qaeda come to your mind immediately .PERIOD
One of their leaders was killed in Pakistan recently .PERIOD
To go around saying that I believe democratic culture is the best that we've arrived at as a form of political organizing is associated with extremism .PERIOD
When talking about those reasons ,COMMA let's break down certain preconceptions .PERIOD
But without freedom of speech ,COMMA you can't have free and fair elections .PERIOD
In the ' 80 s and ' 90 s when Islamism started in the region ,COMMA it spread across the MENA region as a whole .PERIOD

Media ,COMMA the media landscape that we knew ,COMMA as familiar as it was ,COMMA as easy conceptually as it was to deal with the idea that professionals broadcast messages to amateurs ,COMMA is increasingly slipping away .PERIOD
That's the media environment we've got .PERIOD
And today ,COMMA after the global economic crisis ,COMMA there was a whole new set of rules about how the state should intervene .PERIOD
The first ,COMMA to my mind ,COMMA is what I call as the ideas that have arrived .PERIOD
We thought of people as a liability .PERIOD
This change has contributed to the vitality and the whole economy .PERIOD

This is a setup I put in a physics lab .PERIOD
We need to reach a target inside the brain .PERIOD
But you may not know that he tried to perform lobotomies in the brain ,COMMA noninvasively ,COMMA with focused ultrasound in the ' 50 s .PERIOD
And it makes you ponder why those pioneers failed .PERIOD
They were missing the vision .PERIOD
It is approved under an FDAIDE at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville using focused ultrasound to ablate a point in his thalamus .PERIOD
We attach a transducer ,COMMA in this case ,COMMA to the brain ,COMMA but if it will be a different organ ,COMMA it will be a different transducer attached to the patient .PERIOD
It's a target in the thalamus .PERIOD
It doesn't do any damage ,COMMA but it elevates the temperature by a few degrees .PERIOD
But here we can get both the anatomical imaging and the temperature maps in real time .PERIOD
So once the physician verifies that the focus spot is on the target he has chosen ,COMMA then we move to perform a full-energy ablation like you see here .PERIOD
And you have to understand what is in people's mind when they are willing to take the risk .PERIOD
They drove like three hours from their farm to the hospital .PERIOD
So again ,COMMA this is an immediate relief .PERIOD
I don't see ,COMMA without this nation taking it as some collective will or something that is a national goal to make that happen ,COMMA it will not happen .PERIOD

And we have better-than-surgery results in breasts .PERIOD
Women suffer from that disease .PERIOD
In the fashion industry ,COMMA there's very little intellectual property protection .PERIOD
It's because it's a lot harder for knock-off artists to knock off these designs because they can't knock off the logo .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA the reason for this ,COMMA the reason that the fashion industry doesn't have any copyright protection is because the courts decided long ago that apparel is too utilitarian to qualify for copyright protection .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA fashion designers have the broadest palette imaginable in this creative industry .PERIOD
People think this is a magical thing .PERIOD How does it happen ?QUESTIONMARK
Johanna Blakley :COLON Imagine that .PERIOD

And he said to me at the end of his year ,COMMA Jacqueline ,COMMA it was so humbling ,COMMA because I thought as a farmer and as an African I would understand how to transcend culture .PERIOD
Robert Kennedy once said that few of us have the greatness to bend history itself ,COMMA but each of us can work to change a small portion of events .PERIOD
But we do not know his face .PERIOD
I find that hard to believe .PERIOD
It also has to be sufficiently detailed .PERIOD
All we did was look for portraits that had the characteristics of a self-portrait ,COMMA and look ,COMMA they are very similar .PERIOD
They are made in the right order .PERIOD
It has stored ,COMMA recorded ,COMMA can fastly retrieve the meanings of thousands ,COMMA tens of thousands of objects ,COMMA actions ,COMMA and their relationships in the world .PERIOD
Now movement has advanced to the point where it can actually control movement simultaneously ,COMMA in a complex sequence ,COMMA in complex ways as would be required for example for playing a complicated game ,COMMA like soccer .PERIOD
You could go out into the community in Monterey ,COMMA and you'd have difficulty finding a boy that has this ability .PERIOD
And in fact they result in a wonderful differentiation in humankind ,COMMA in the way that ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA no two of us are quite alike .PERIOD
And we try to track the changes that occur as the new skill or ability is acquired .PERIOD
From these studies we defined two great epochs of the plastic history of the brain .PERIOD
And that is the period in which the brain is setting up in its initial form its basic processing machinery .PERIOD
And I see the brain actually develop a processor that is specialized -- specialized for that complex array ,COMMA a repertoire of sounds .PERIOD
He's successful in his retrieval of food with this tool every time .PERIOD
We can look down in the brain of the monkey .PERIOD
We've actually distorted the map by the exercise .PERIOD
And each one of them changes in ways that are specific to the skill or ability .PERIOD
It represents changes of hundreds of millions ,COMMA possibly billions of synaptic connections in your brain .PERIOD
That is why you ,COMMA in your many skills and abilities ,COMMA are a unique specialist :COLON a specialist that's vastly different in your physical brain in detail than the brain of an individual 100 years ago ;SEMICOLON enormously different in the details from the brain of the average individual 1000 years ago .PERIOD
It's not English .PERIOD It's noisy English .PERIOD
Changing it in detail .PERIOD It takes about 30 hours on the average .PERIOD
You can see that most of the children on the left side of the distribution are moving into the middle or the right .PERIOD
This is a substantially large impact .PERIOD
I'm specifically interested in things like autism ,COMMA and cerebral palsy ,COMMA these great childhood catastrophes .PERIOD
But also in your future is brain aerobics .PERIOD
Get ready for it .PERIOD It's going to be a part of every life not too far in the future ,COMMA just like physical exercise is a part of every well organized life in the contemporary period .PERIOD
Of course a lot of people will ignore this advice .PERIOD
And one of the stories he told me so often when I was a young boy was of the first British atomic bomb test .PERIOD
What he was trying to do with me was to inspire me to protect the world ,COMMA and show me just how fragile the world is .PERIOD
I love the place .PERIOD
Fresh water freezes at zero .PERIOD
I remember just trying to get out of the water .PERIOD
And for a swimmer ,COMMA you need to feel your hands because you need to be able to grab the water and pull it through with you .PERIOD
We are going to actually have to take them off .PERIOD
And I remember looking into the ice ,COMMA and there were big chunks of white ice in there ,COMMA and the water was completely black .PERIOD
It's a very frightening ,COMMA very ,COMMA very frightening thought .PERIOD
It's all a little bit frightening ,COMMA and emotional .PERIOD
The first thing we need to do is we need to break this problem down into manageable chunks .PERIOD
I've just come back from giving a series of speeches in some of the poorest townships in South Africa to young children as young as 10 years old .PERIOD
We need to believe in ourselves .PERIOD
But the most important thing we must do is ,COMMA I think ,COMMA we must all walk to the end of our lives and turn around ,COMMA and ask ourselves a most fundamental question .PERIOD
You take about eight or so carbon atoms ,COMMA about 20 hydrogen atoms ,COMMA you put them together in exactly the right way and you get this marvelous liquid :COLON very energy-dense and very easy to refine into a number of very useful products and fuels .PERIOD
But what about oil ?QUESTIONMARK Where is it in the energy system ?QUESTIONMARK
And that continues into the future with the renewables that we're developing today ,COMMA reaching maybe 30 percent of primary energy by mid century .PERIOD
I picked it up outside of Marble Falls ,COMMA Texas .PERIOD
And it's different than this limestone ,COMMA you can see that .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA millions of abalone every year make this shell .PERIOD
It's the same stuff as this and the same stuff as this .PERIOD
And why ?QUESTIONMARK Because the lowly abalone is able to lay down the calcium carbonate crystals in layers ,COMMA making this beautiful ,COMMA iridescent mother of pearl .PERIOD
Very specialized material that the abalone self-assembles ,COMMA millions of abalone ,COMMA all the time ,COMMA every day ,COMMA every year .PERIOD
How the molecules are put together .PERIOD
Here's a piece of coal .PERIOD
No wonder that most of the most important international operators in Germany ,COMMA but also in France and the UK and Scandinavia ,COMMA everywhere ,COMMA systematically bribed .PERIOD
They are not as good at bribing as many of their international competitors are ,COMMA but they were not allowed to show their strengths ,COMMA because the world was eaten up by grand corruption .PERIOD
In the first session -- we had three sessions over the course of two years .PERIOD
They even applaud it .PERIOD
The World Bank has turned from Saulus to Paulus ;SEMICOLON under Wolfensohn ,COMMA they became ,COMMA I would say ,COMMA the strongest anti-corruption agency in the world .PERIOD
They have to have a much more transparent financial governance .PERIOD
And that's what it's about .PERIOD
We use portraiture as a way to deliver those lives ,COMMA but that's it .PERIOD
And I thought really what we need is an elders program to just sit at the feet of amazing people and hear them talk .PERIOD
That's Barbara Walters and others like that ,COMMA and we like that .PERIOD
And he had never appeared in public since that point .PERIOD
And she said ,COMMA Well ,COMMA something very weird was happening .PERIOD
I didn't know what was going on ,COMMA but I was so part of the process of getting that out .PERIOD
These were people through their 90 s .PERIOD
But after the interview ,COMMA I got a call ,COMMA very gruff voice ,COMMA from a woman .PERIOD
Never ever get up on a stage with somebody who's modest ,COMMA because all of these people have been assembled to listen to them ,COMMA and they sit there and they say ,COMMA Aw ,COMMA shucks ,COMMA it was an accident .PERIOD
The worst interview I ever did :COLON William L .PERIOD Shirer .PERIOD
And she stonewalled me .PERIOD It was unbelievable .PERIOD
That's the problem here ,COMMA and she's fighting me for that ,COMMA and so then I asked her a question -- I didn't know how I was going to get out of it -- I asked her a question about her days as a playwright ,COMMA and again ,COMMA characteristically ,COMMA instead of saying ,COMMA Oh yes ,COMMA I was a playwright ,COMMA and this is what blah blah blah ,COMMA she said ,COMMA Oh ,COMMA playwright .PERIOD Everybody knows I was a playwright .PERIOD
She wanted the control of her final moment ,COMMA and she did it amazingly .PERIOD
His father was an SOB ,COMMA and ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA he was another comedian with an unhappy childhood ,COMMA but then we were off and running .PERIOD
Again ,COMMA some of you will know him ,COMMA most of you won't ,COMMA Dumas Malone .PERIOD
And here is this man who had given his whole life to uncovering Jefferson and connecting with him ,COMMA and he said ,COMMA Well .PERIOD -- I'm going to do a bad southern accent .PERIOD
I have a story ,COMMA a story that I would like to share with you .PERIOD
And it's an African story .PERIOD
And so maybe you're thinking now ,COMMA why ,COMMA how ,COMMA an Italian filmmaker based in Boston is so interested in this story ?QUESTIONMARK
And I was born in Zambia .PERIOD
I have the good fortune of being a filmmaker-in-residence at the Center of Digital Imaging Arts at Boston University .PERIOD
There are several themes from the documentary ,COMMA but they are re-edited and made for you ,COMMA OK ?QUESTIONMARK
Milverton Nwokedi :COLON You cut a nice movie with just 10000 dollars in Nigeria here .PERIOD
They can afford to watch their Robocop and whatever .PERIOD
Because nobody believed that Nollywood can come out of Africa .PERIOD
Narrator :COLON Suspense ,COMMA fun and intrigue .PERIOD
It's the blockbuster comedy .PERIOD
It is not what you hear ,COMMA you know ,COMMA from the Western press .PERIOD
Man :COLON Let's go .PERIOD
Like they go ,COMMA here ,COMMA now ,COMMA now ,COMMA you see the gun there ,COMMA but you won't see any guns shot ,COMMA we use knock-out .PERIOD
Kevin Books Ikeduba :COLON What I'm scared of is just the explosion will come up in my face .PERIOD
You know ,COMMA this is Nollywood ,COMMA where the magic lives .PERIOD
But always with a smile ,COMMA always with an enthusiasm ,COMMA that is incredible .PERIOD
The Nigerian filmmakers really ,COMMA really ,COMMA are doing what they like .PERIOD
And so it's a very ,COMMA very important thing for them ,COMMA and for their audiences .PERIOD
Filmmakers ,COMMA friends of mine ,COMMA they look at Nollywood and they say ,COMMA Wow ,COMMA they are doing what we really want to do ,COMMA and make a buck and live with this job .PERIOD
No stories around the campfire .PERIOD
Difficult ,COMMA eh ?QUESTIONMARK It's meaningless .PERIOD
I think that the key to a healthy society is a thriving community of storytellers ,COMMA and I think that the Nigerian filmmakers really have proved this .PERIOD
It’s not an added sequence ,COMMA just some voices from Nollywood .PERIOD
And we know that there are more .PERIOD
They can be rented for pennies .PERIOD
You can be in a Lagos traffic jam and you can buy a movie or some bananas or some water .PERIOD Yes .PERIOD
In fact ,COMMA it appeared in a porno comic book ,COMMA which is the slide on the right .PERIOD
On the left-hand side ,COMMA I had the context of those little houses ,COMMA and I tried to build a building that fit into that context .PERIOD
And then I did a law school for Loyola in downtown LA .PERIOD
And it was my theory ,COMMA or my point of view ,COMMA that one didn't upstage the neighborhood -- one made accommodations .PERIOD
I mean ,COMMA the story I tell is that I got mad at postmodernism -- at po-mo -- and said that fish were 500 million years earlier than man ,COMMA and if you're going to go back ,COMMA we might as well go back to the beginning .PERIOD
And so I started making these funny things .PERIOD
And the client said ,COMMA Why no fish ?QUESTIONMARK
It was a dialog with the context again .PERIOD
Couldn't find it .PERIOD
So .PERIOD
And it's one of the nicest pieces I've ever made ,COMMA I think .PERIOD
For reasons we don't want to talk about ,COMMA it got delayed .PERIOD
I went around Toronto and found a bathtub like my grandmother's ,COMMA and I put the fish in .PERIOD
And we've started to work on things .PERIOD
The highlight of the performance was at the end .PERIOD
And so I did a lot of dirty things with chain link ,COMMA which nobody will forgive me for .PERIOD
It's in perspective and everything .PERIOD
But we were trying to collide our ideas ,COMMA to put objects next to each other .PERIOD
Like a Morandi -- like the little bottles -- composing them like a still life .PERIOD
And he pushed that .PERIOD
And it was this interaction between that kind of ,COMMA up-the-ante stuff that became pretty interesting .PERIOD
And I still think the Time magazine picture will be of the binoculars ,COMMA you know ,COMMA leaving out the -- what the hell .PERIOD
I said ,COMMA If I can't get the craft that I want ,COMMA I'll use the craft I can get .PERIOD
And it was all of one material ,COMMA and the metal could go on the roof as well as the walls .PERIOD
I was given an opportunity to design an exhibit for the metalworkers' unions of America and Canada in Washington ,COMMA and I did it on the condition that they become my partners in the future and help me with all future metal buildings ,COMMA etc .PERIOD etc .PERIOD
And then more metal and some chain link in Santa Monica -- a little shopping center .PERIOD
It gave me an opportunity to make a sculpture out of it .PERIOD
When you have to do something really cheaply ,COMMA it's hard to get perfect corners and stuff .PERIOD
He didn't recommend me ,COMMA by the way .PERIOD
I keep trying to make it work .PERIOD
It's never been finished .PERIOD
This is the city hall over here somewhere ,COMMA and the courthouse .PERIOD
Sohio is on the axis here ,COMMA and we followed the axis ,COMMA and they're two kind of goalposts .PERIOD
And all this stuff at the bottom is a museum ,COMMA and an idea for a very fancy automobile entry .PERIOD
And following that basic idea of the village ,COMMA we changed it as we got into it .PERIOD
That's the living room .PERIOD
You come down from this level along the stairway ,COMMA and you enter the bedroom here ,COMMA going into the lake .PERIOD
These Stonehenge things were designed to give foreground and to create a greater depth in this shallow lot .PERIOD
I was trying to get around this plan coupe -- how do you do it ?QUESTIONMARK
Jay Chiat is a glutton for punishment ,COMMA and he hired me to do a house for him in the Hamptons .PERIOD
And then this is a kind of a shopping mall ,COMMA with a rodeo and restaurants .PERIOD
It has a chamber hall .PERIOD
There's commercial at the ground floor .PERIOD
The acoustician in the competition gave us criteria ,COMMA which led to this compartmentalized scheme ,COMMA which we found out after the competition would not work at all .PERIOD
And the Ritz-Carlton Tower is being designed with exposed steel ,COMMA non-fire proof ,COMMA much like those old gas tanks .PERIOD
And the food wasn't as good as the stuff ,COMMA and so it failed .PERIOD
Thank you very much .PERIOD
I know Bill Joy was talking to you about the wonders of carbon nanotubes ,COMMA so I'm going to talk to you about the wonders of carbon macro-tubes ,COMMA which is charcoal .PERIOD
What we wanted to do was we wanted to find a way to harness this waste resource and turn it into a fuel that would be something that people could easily cook with ,COMMA something like charcoal .PERIOD
After some time ,COMMA after setting it on fire ,COMMA you seal it to restrict the oxygen that goes into the kiln ,COMMA and then you end up with this carbonized material here .PERIOD
However ,COMMA you can't burn this .PERIOD It's too fine and it burns too quickly to be useful for cooking .PERIOD
So we had to try to find a way to form it into useful briquettes .PERIOD
Compared to the sugarcane charcoal ,COMMA where we actually have to teach people how to form it into briquettes and you have the extra step of cooking the binder ,COMMA this comes pre-briquetted .PERIOD
But this is one of the incredibly rare situations where you also have economic benefits .PERIOD
They can generate income from this .PERIOD
They can save the money that they were going to spend on charcoal ,COMMA and they can produce excess and sell it in the market to people who aren't making their own .PERIOD
I mean the world where advanced building materials means cement roofing tiles that are made by hand ,COMMA and where ,COMMA when you work 10 hours a day ,COMMA you're still only earning 60 dollars in a month .PERIOD
And more than half of you would be living on less than a dollar a day .PERIOD
Do you need to find entrepreneurs ,COMMA or venture capitalists ,COMMA or what do you need to take what you've got and get it to scale ?QUESTIONMARK
These are some of my kids with a salad bar .PERIOD
And the very first thing was about regional food -- trying to eat food from within our region .PERIOD
We can't keep feeding our kids pesticides and herbicides and antibiotics and hormones .PERIOD
The USDA allows these antibiotics ,COMMA these hormones and these pesticides in our food supply ,COMMA and the USDA paid for this ad in Time magazine .PERIOD
It's no wonder ,COMMA you know ,COMMA we have criminals .PERIOD
What goes in is what we are .PERIOD
The CDC ,COMMA the Center for Disease Control ,COMMA has said ,COMMA of the children born in the year 2000 -- those seven- and eight-year-olds today -- one out of every three Caucasians ,COMMA one out of every two African-Americans and Hispanics are going to have diabetes in their lifetime .PERIOD
And it's because of what we feed them .PERIOD
This is the USDA portion size ,COMMA that little ,COMMA tiny thing .PERIOD
In case you can't tell ,COMMA that's ,COMMA like ,COMMA pink Danish and some kind of cupcakes .PERIOD
In fact ,COMMA this may be what a lot of parents serve ,COMMA as opposed to -- this is what we try and serve .PERIOD
There's not a strawberry tree or a carrot bush .PERIOD
You're not going to get the next generation ,COMMA or the generation after ,COMMA to be able to think like this if they're not nourished .PERIOD
And these calendars really started to lay out my program .PERIOD
You know ,COMMA we have to change it .PERIOD
We have to teach kids that if they're on a diet of refined sugar ,COMMA they go up and down ,COMMA just like if they're on a diet of crack .PERIOD
And we have to pull it all together .PERIOD We have composting in all of our schools .PERIOD
Because ,COMMA you know what ,COMMA many of us are sort of at the end of our careers ,COMMA and we need to be giving these kids -- these young kids ,COMMA the next generation -- the tools to save themselves and save the planet .PERIOD
I had 90 employees .PERIOD
In this country ,COMMA we're spending 110 billion dollars a year on fast food .PERIOD
That 8 billion comes down to two dollars and 49 cents -- that's what the government allocates for lunch .PERIOD
And those are the same kids who are going to be getting sick .PERIOD
Look how odd he looks with the eyebrows missing .PERIOD
Max has kindly donated his photograph to me .PERIOD
Our research has shown that the parents and close loved ones of these children adore them .PERIOD
We crave the approval of our peers .PERIOD
I'd like you all in the audience now to push your lower jaw forward .PERIOD
People know now that I'm enthusiastic ,COMMA that I'm a happy person .PERIOD
He maintained a calm insouciance .PERIOD
We can categorize it like that .PERIOD
Because you might say ,COMMA Well ,COMMA this type of surgery might be regarded as cosmetic .PERIOD
I'll move it off ,COMMA and we'll have a blank slide for those who are squeamish amongst you .PERIOD
And again ,COMMA as I told you ,COMMA if they have a caring family and good work life ,COMMA then they can lead normal and fulfilled lives .PERIOD
So it's not simply a Western phenomenon .PERIOD
We make judgments on people's faces all the time .PERIOD
Good-looking people are always judged as being more friendly .PERIOD
This is an image of Ann who's had her right jaw removed and the base of her skull removed .PERIOD
So it's very valuable to have that tool in our armamentarium .PERIOD
But the patients are going to have to take drugs that suppress their immune system for the rest of their lives .PERIOD
We're still not curing enough patients -- it's the most disfiguring cancer .PERIOD
We still can't get rid of scars .PERIOD
Whereas I felt that when you design ,COMMA you either improve or you create a detriment to the community in which you're designing in .PERIOD
Working within the United States ,COMMA most people look at poverty and they see the face of a foreigner ,COMMA but go live -- I live in Bozeman ,COMMA Montana -- go up to the north plains on the reservations ,COMMA or go down to Alabama or Mississippi pre-Katrina ,COMMA and I could have shown you places that have far worse conditions than many developing countries I've been to .PERIOD
So in the past seven years -- this isn't just about nonprofit .PERIOD
What it showed me is that there's a grassroots movement going on of socially responsible designers who really believe that this world has got a lot smaller ,COMMA and that we have the opportunity -- not the responsibility ,COMMA but the opportunity -- to really get involved in making change .PERIOD
So it's really important that if we're designing and trying to create change ,COMMA we build that change .PERIOD
And it wasn't doctors telling us this ;SEMICOLON it was actual villagers that we were staying with .PERIOD
We just don't know how to show this .PERIOD
And on the fourth week ,COMMA the doctors come and they mow out an area ,COMMA put a tensile structure on the top and when the doctors have finished treating and seeing patients and villagers ,COMMA you cut down the clinic and you eat it .PERIOD It's an Eat Your Own Clinic .PERIOD
And you have to keep the maintenance down .PERIOD
And so we decided to look at the idea of sports and create a youth sports center that doubled as an HIV/AIDS outreach center ,COMMA and the coaches of the girls' team were also trained doctors .PERIOD
So this is the designer .PERIOD He's out there working with the first ever women's soccer team in Kwa-Zulu Natal ,COMMA Siyathemba ,COMMA and they can tell it better .PERIOD
Video :COLON Well ,COMMA my name is Sisi ,COMMA because I work at the African center .PERIOD
This was a connection ,COMMA just a meeting with somebody who wanted to develop Africa's first telemedicine center ,COMMA in Tanzania .PERIOD
This is a 370 -dollar shelter that can be easily assembled .PERIOD
Designing housing .PERIOD This house is going to go in in a couple of weeks .PERIOD
We put together very quickly a washroom .PERIOD
This is Shandra and the Calhouns .PERIOD They're photographers who have documented the Lower Ninth for the last 40 years .PERIOD
One billion people live in abject poverty .PERIOD
If we do nothing about the housing crisis that's about to happen ,COMMA in 20 years ,COMMA one in three people will live in an unplanned settlement or a refugee camp .PERIOD Look left ,COMMA look right :COLON one of you will be there .PERIOD
And I want this whole thing to work multi-lingually .PERIOD
The idea of needs-based competitions -- X-Prize for the other 98 percent ,COMMA if you want to call it that .PERIOD
We also want to look at ways of matchmaking and putting funding partners together .PERIOD
There should be a sheet .PERIOD I don't have time to read this ,COMMA because I'm going to be yanked off .PERIOD
So I'm going to speak about a problem that I have and that's that I'm a philosopher .PERIOD
And I get hoots of derision and cackles and growls because they think ,COMMA That's impossible !EXCLAMATIONMARK You can't explain consciousness .PERIOD
My late ,COMMA lamented friend Bob Nozick ,COMMA a fine philosopher ,COMMA in one of his books ,COMMA Philosophical Explanations ,COMMA is commenting on the ethos of philosophy -- the way philosophers go about their business .PERIOD
I'm sure that people here who work on ,COMMA say ,COMMA climate change and global warming ,COMMA or on the future of the Internet ,COMMA encounter people who have very strong opinions about what's going to happen next .PERIOD
But with regard to consciousness ,COMMA people seem to think ,COMMA each of us seems to think ,COMMA I am an expert .PERIOD
No other ingredients at all .PERIOD We're just made of cells ,COMMA about 100 trillion of them .PERIOD
The content -- there's color ,COMMA there's ideas ,COMMA there's memories ,COMMA there's history .PERIOD And somehow all that content of consciousness is accomplished by the busy activity of those hoards of neurons .PERIOD
So this is the problem .PERIOD So I have to do a little bit of the sort of work that a lot of you won't like ,COMMA for the same reason that you don't like to see a magic trick explained to you .PERIOD
It's one that I predicted in the last page or two of my 1991 book ,COMMA Consciousness Explained ,COMMA where I said if you did experiments of this sort ,COMMA you'd find that people were unable to pick up really large changes .PERIOD
And as I walked towards the picture ,COMMA I was expecting detail that wasn't there .PERIOD
You're familiar with a more recent technology ,COMMA which is -- There ,COMMA you can get a better view of the blobs .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA what does your brain do when it takes the suggestion ?QUESTIONMARK
I don't think so .PERIOD Not a chance .PERIOD But then ,COMMA how on Earth is it done ?QUESTIONMARK
It's the same thing .PERIOD
The brain isn't actually putting the detail in your head at all .PERIOD
Is the shape on the left the same as the shape on the right ,COMMA rotated ?QUESTIONMARK
Yes .PERIOD
And if you read that literature ,COMMA one of the things that you really have to come to terms with is even when you're the subject in the experiment ,COMMA you don't know .PERIOD
Well ,COMMA that's where you have to go backstage and ask the magician .PERIOD
How many of you see that sort of boundary ,COMMA with the Necker cube floating in front of the circles ?QUESTIONMARK
Can you see it ?QUESTIONMARK
When you see the cube one way ,COMMA behind the screen ,COMMA those boundaries go away .PERIOD
And I supposed that that was just a flat truth ,COMMA always true .PERIOD
Let me just pause this for a second if I can .PERIOD
So now we're going to be subjects in the experiment .PERIOD
Audience :COLON Yes .PERIOD
So 155 seconds is the median time for subjects in his experiment there .PERIOD
How many still don't see it ?QUESTIONMARK How many still don't see it ?QUESTIONMARK
Thank you very much .PERIOD
And I ever met more humble people .PERIOD
The mosque where the respectful foreigner is showered with blessings and with tears ,COMMA and welcomed as a gift .PERIOD
What do we know about the women 10 years after the war ?QUESTIONMARK
Well ,COMMA the thesis of The Bottom Billion is that a billion people have been stuck living in economies that have been stagnant for 40 years ,COMMA and hence diverging from the rest of mankind .PERIOD
The last time the rich world got serious about developing another region was in the late 1940 s .PERIOD
Yes ,COMMA you tear up the Eleventh Commandment -- national sovereignty .PERIOD
We need to be at least as serious as we were then .PERIOD
The commodity booms are pumping unprecedented amounts of money into many ,COMMA though not all ,COMMA of the countries of the bottom billion .PERIOD
So ,COMMA a mass of new discoveries .PERIOD
Just to give you one example :COLON Angola alone is getting 50 billion dollars a year in oil revenue .PERIOD
So ,COMMA here comes a bit of science ,COMMA and this is a bit of science I've done since The Bottom Billion ,COMMA so it's new .PERIOD
Come back 15 years later .PERIOD
You know how rights to resource extraction are being sold at the moment ,COMMA how they've been sold over the last 40 years ?QUESTIONMARK
A company flies in ,COMMA does a deal with a minister .PERIOD
Thank you .PERIOD
I was an unlikely person to be doing this .PERIOD
I never studied sculpture ,COMMA engineering or architecture .PERIOD
It's a self-portrait titled Wide Hips .PERIOD
Returning to India to work with those fishermen ,COMMA we made a net of a million and a half hand-tied knots -- installed briefly in Madrid .PERIOD
My life was not going to be the same .PERIOD
Next challenge ,COMMA the Biennial of the Americas in Denver asked ,COMMA could I represent the 35 nations of the Western hemisphere and their interconnectedness in a sculpture ?QUESTIONMARK
I read about the recent earthquake in Chile and the tsunami that rippled across the entire Pacific Ocean .PERIOD
I started my journey 30 years ago .PERIOD
And that also brought me to the fact that this poses such a risk to our society .PERIOD
And together they only form about 15 years of supply .PERIOD
But now ,COMMA we have a real technology to do this .PERIOD
When they control their brain ,COMMA they can control their pain .PERIOD
When you do ,COMMA what do you want to control ?QUESTIONMARK
You will be able to look at all the aspects that make you yourself ,COMMA all your experiences .PERIOD
These are some of the areas we're working on today that I don't have time to go into in detail .PERIOD
But I want to leave with you the big question .PERIOD
We are the first generation that's going to be able to enter into ,COMMA using this technology ,COMMA the human mind and brain .PERIOD
What is worth dying for ?QUESTIONMARK
We know that it's possible to live in a failed state ,COMMA where everything that can go wrong does go wrong -- where mothers cannot feed their children ,COMMA where strangers cannot find the basis for peaceful collaboration ,COMMA where people are murdered indiscriminately .PERIOD
For instance ,COMMA there are 21 states in our country where corporal punishment in the classroom is legal ,COMMA where it is legal for a teacher to beat a child with a wooden board ,COMMA hard ,COMMA and raising large bruises and blisters and even breaking the skin .PERIOD
But we can ask the obvious question :COLON Is it a good idea ,COMMA generally speaking ,COMMA to subject children to pain and violence and public humiliation as a way of encouraging healthy emotional development and good behavior ?QUESTIONMARK
Now ,COMMA many of you might worry that the notion of well-being is truly undefined ,COMMA and seemingly perpetually open to be re-construed .PERIOD
When this statue was carved the average life expectancy was probably 30 .PERIOD
does not tempt us to say that there are no truths to be known about human nutrition .PERIOD
Many people worry that a universal morality would require moral precepts that admit of no exceptions .PERIOD
And yet ,COMMA chess is a domain of perfect objectivity .PERIOD
But what does voluntary mean in a community where ,COMMA when a girl gets raped ,COMMA her father's first impulse ,COMMA rather often ,COMMA is to murder her out of shame ?QUESTIONMARK
Just let that fact detonate in your brain for a minute :COLON Your daughter gets raped ,COMMA and what you want to do is kill her .PERIOD
But if we are in a reflective mood ,COMMA we can ask ,COMMA Is this the perfect expression of psychological balance with respect to variables like youth and beauty and women's bodies ?QUESTIONMARK
Whenever we are talking about facts certain opinions must be excluded .PERIOD
Paint your picture of what rolling the clock 50 years forward ,COMMA 100 years forward ,COMMA how you would like to think of the world ,COMMA balancing moral progress with richness .PERIOD
But again ,COMMA then we have to talk about well-being in a larger context .PERIOD
Sam ,COMMA this is a conversation I would actually love to continue for hours .PERIOD
We don't have that ,COMMA but maybe another time .PERIOD Thank you for coming to TED .PERIOD
And then ,COMMA within zoology ,COMMA I took the course or the discipline of entomology ,COMMA the science of insects .PERIOD
Because biological control phenomenon ,COMMA you can see it in your backyard .PERIOD
So this phenomenon of natural control exists literally everywhere .PERIOD
So it's everywhere ,COMMA and we need to know how to exploit it .PERIOD
What damage [does] it actually inflict on the plant ?QUESTIONMARK
Insects ,COMMA those six-legged organisms and spiders or mites ,COMMA the eight-legged organisms .PERIOD
On your right-hand side you can see a cucumber leaf ,COMMA and on the middle ,COMMA cotton leaf ,COMMA and on the left a tomato leaf with these little stipplings .PERIOD
By the way ,COMMA it's springtime now in Israel .PERIOD
When temperature rises sharply ,COMMA you can see those bad ones ,COMMA those aphids ,COMMA all over the plants ,COMMA in your hibiscus ,COMMA in your lantana ,COMMA in the young ,COMMA fresh foliage of the spring flush ,COMMA so-called .PERIOD
This is all natural .PERIOD This is all natural .PERIOD
Again ,COMMA we'll start first with the pest :COLON the thrips .PERIOD
This is a sweet pepper which is not consumable because it is suffering from a viral disease transmitted by those thrip adults .PERIOD
Many different parts .PERIOD
By the way ,COMMA they have a very nice landscape -- you see the Jordanian Mountains on the one hand and the Jordan Valley on the other hand ,COMMA and a good ,COMMA mild winter and a nice ,COMMA hot summer ,COMMA which is an excellent condition to mass-produce those creatures .PERIOD
Here we come with those natural enemies in order to reverse a little bit of the wheel and to bring more natural balance to the agricultural plot by reducing those chemicals .PERIOD
In this table ,COMMA you can actually see what is an impact of a successful biological control by good bugs .PERIOD
But if we go ,COMMA for example ,COMMA to this place ,COMMA Southeast Israel ,COMMA the Arava area above the Great Rift Valley ,COMMA where the really top-notch -- the pearl of the Israeli agriculture is located ,COMMA especially under greenhouse conditions ,COMMA or under screenhouse conditions -- if you drive all the way to Eilat ,COMMA you see this just in the middle of the desert .PERIOD
Step by step ,COMMA it does narrow .PERIOD
So I'm saying it on behalf of all the biocontrol petitioners and implementers ,COMMA in Israel and abroad ,COMMA really give nature a chance .PERIOD
How can we understand what makes some societies more fragile than other societies ?QUESTIONMARK The problem is obviously relevant to our situation today ,COMMA because today as well ,COMMA there are some societies that have already collapsed ,COMMA such as Somalia and Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia .PERIOD There are also societies today that may be close to collapse ,COMMA such as Nepal ,COMMA Indonesia and Columbia .PERIOD
What is there that we can learn from the past that would help us avoid declining or collapsing in the way that so many past societies have ?QUESTIONMARK
Why did they all end up dead ?QUESTIONMARK Well ,COMMA in my five-point framework ,COMMA the first item on the framework is to look for human impacts on the environment :COLON people inadvertently destroying the resource base on which they depend .PERIOD And in the case of the Viking Norse ,COMMA the Vikings inadvertently caused soil erosion and deforestation ,COMMA which was a particular problem for them because they required forests to make charcoal ,COMMA to make iron .PERIOD
Or again ,COMMA the collapse of the Soviet Union took place within a couple of decades ,COMMA maybe within a decade ,COMMA of the time when the Soviet Union was at its greatest power .PERIOD
So ,COMMA this is a frequent theme :COLON societies collapse very soon after reaching their peak in power .PERIOD
And I would expect that ,COMMA if our human civilization carries on ,COMMA then maybe in the next century people will be asking ,COMMA why on earth did these people today in the year 2003 not see the obvious things that they were doing and take corrective action ?QUESTIONMARK
One blueprint for trouble ,COMMA making collapse likely ,COMMA is where there is a conflict of interest between the short-term interest of the decision-making elites and the long-term interest of the society as a whole ,COMMA especially if the elites are able to insulate themselves from the consequences of their actions .PERIOD Where what's good in the short run for the elite is bad for the society as a whole ,COMMA there's a real risk of the elite doing things that would bring the society down in the long run .PERIOD
So ,COMMA that's one general conclusion about why societies make bad decisions :COLON conflicts of interest .PERIOD
Instead ,COMMA all the major threats facing us today are problems entirely of our own making .PERIOD And since we made the problems ,COMMA we can also solve the problems .PERIOD That then means that it's entirely in our power to deal with these problems .PERIOD
So I think I'm actually the first one here -- I lead .PERIOD
And meanwhile ,COMMA I use nonsense ,COMMA as you can see .PERIOD
This was one of a series called Zany Afternoons ,COMMA which became a book .PERIOD
But the zeppelin was the biggest thing that ever moved made by man .PERIOD
There's Moscow ,COMMA Shirley .PERIOD Hope they speak Esperanto !EXCLAMATIONMARK
Those ,COMMA for example ,COMMA are Mark IV British tanks from 1916 .PERIOD
Happy little story ,COMMA isn't it ?QUESTIONMARK
Anybody who was anybody had an apartment there .PERIOD
It's obviously modeled on the Titanic .PERIOD
I thought I could jazz it up a bit ,COMMA have a little fun with it .PERIOD
This is the word side of my brain .PERIOD
And then when it ran ,COMMA a lovely lady ,COMMA an old lady named Mrs .PERIOD Edgar Rosenberg -- if you know that name -- called me and said she loved the cover ,COMMA it was so sweet .PERIOD
Pretty elegant .PERIOD Nothing like a crash to end a joke .PERIOD That completes my oeuvre .PERIOD
Okay ,COMMA I'm going to show you again something about our diets .PERIOD
There's six million species of insects on this planet ,COMMA six million species .PERIOD
There was an estimation ,COMMA a conservative estimation ,COMMA a couple of years ago that the US .PERIOD economy benefited by 57 billion dollars per year .PERIOD
Small animals eat insects .PERIOD
And here you see me enjoying a meal with caterpillars ,COMMA locusts ,COMMA bee pupae -- delicacies .PERIOD
You're eating at least 500 grams per year .PERIOD
We're even doing this on purpose .PERIOD
Now the situation in the world is going to change for you and me ,COMMA for everyone on this Earth .PERIOD
There was an FAO conference last October that was completely devoted to this .PERIOD
And we eat quite a lot of it .PERIOD
In the developing world it's much lower .PERIOD
So if you would be an entrepreneur ,COMMA what would you do ?QUESTIONMARK
I gave you at least four arguments in favor .PERIOD
There are entrepreneurs in the Netherlands that produce them ,COMMA and one of them is here in the audience ,COMMA Marian Peeters ,COMMA who's in the picture .PERIOD
Well in the Netherlands ,COMMA we have an innovative Minister of Agriculture ,COMMA and she puts the insects on the menu in her restaurant in her ministry .PERIOD
Reset the three minutes ,COMMA that's just not fair .PERIOD
I would still be on my bad hip .PERIOD That was so disappointing .PERIOD
Great !EXCLAMATIONMARK Excellent !EXCLAMATIONMARK
So no ,COMMA suddenly I wasn't averse to butting any geezer off the list .PERIOD
They were desperate for volunteers because the average age of the volunteer at the hospital gift shop was 75 .PERIOD
So ,COMMA next thing you know ,COMMA I had my bright blue volunteer vest ,COMMA I had my photo ID ,COMMA and I was fully trained by my 89 -year-old boss .PERIOD
I draped them casually over the chair in the doctor's office .PERIOD
But ,COMMA I'd like to ask you ,COMMA how would you tell the time if you didn't have an iPhone ?QUESTIONMARK
You know ,COMMA I've always wanted one of these .PERIOD
And this one ,COMMA this is a replica from a 15 th-century device .PERIOD
So ,COMMA tonight ,COMMA if it's clear you'll be able to see the summer triangle .PERIOD
Step three is identify the star on the front of the device .PERIOD
He would know what time the sun would rise ,COMMA and what time it would set .PERIOD
Probably not one made of brass .PERIOD He would have one made out of wood ,COMMA or paper .PERIOD And the vast majority of this first computer was a portable device that you could keep in the back of your pocket .PERIOD
So ,COMMA what does the astrolabe inspire ?QUESTIONMARK
And what we gain with a new technology ,COMMA of course ,COMMA is precision and accuracy .PERIOD
I'm just going to show you how the robot works .PERIOD
So ,COMMA even though there is nothing in nature that looks like this ,COMMA really ,COMMA we were inspired by biology and applying the principles of walking to this robot .PERIOD Thus it's a biologically inspired robot .PERIOD
We want to fold up the legs and shoot it up for long-range motion .PERIOD
We developed our adaptive gait planner .PERIOD
Welcome to RoMeLa ,COMMA the Robotics Mechanisms Laboratory at Virginia Tech .PERIOD
This robot is an amoeba robot .PERIOD
Robotic Air Powered Hand with Elastic Ligaments .PERIOD
We wanted to go tackle this problem in a very different direction .PERIOD
So ,COMMA for example in Iraq ,COMMA you know ,COMMA the war zone ,COMMA there is roadside bombs .PERIOD Currently you send these remotely controlled vehicles that are armed .PERIOD
We actually have a fan club for the robot ,COMMA DARwIn :COLON Dynamic Anthropomorphic Robot with Intelligence .PERIOD
So ,COMMA based on that success ,COMMA the following year we did the proper mechanical design starting from kinematics .PERIOD
And thus ,COMMA DARwIn I was born in 2005 .PERIOD
Dennis Hong :COLON So ,COMMA there is actually a competition called RoboCup .PERIOD
We were the very first team in the United States that qualified in the humanoid RoboCup competition .PERIOD
We truly believe this is going to be the very first running humanoid robot in the United States .PERIOD So ,COMMA stay tuned .PERIOD
How do we develop these kinds of ideas ?QUESTIONMARK
We have a fully autonomous vehicle that can drive into urban environments .PERIOD We won a half a million dollars in the DARPA Urban Challenge .PERIOD
We also have the world's very first vehicle that can be driven by the blind .PERIOD
He gave a talk about how education and school kills creativity .PERIOD
For us roboticists ,COMMA engineers and scientists ,COMMA these tools ,COMMA these are the courses and classes you take in class .PERIOD
These are all the tools that we need .PERIOD
Bertie County is kind of a prime example in the demise of rural America .PERIOD
There are more buildings that are empty or in disrepair than occupied and in use .PERIOD
He was brought in in October 2007 as the new superintendent to basically fix this broken school system .PERIOD
So in February of 2009 ,COMMA Dr .PERIOD Zullinger invited us ,COMMA Project H Design -- which is a non-profit design firm that I founded -- to come to Bertie and to partner with him on the repair of this school district and to bring a design perspective to the repair of the school district .PERIOD
We now call this place home .PERIOD
But beyond our personal reasons for wanting to be there ,COMMA there is a huge need .PERIOD
It allows elementary-level students to learn core subjects through game play and activity and running around and screaming and being a kid .PERIOD
So the first batch of computers are being installed later this summer ,COMMA and we're helping Dr .PERIOD Zullinger develop some strategies around how we might connect the classroom and the home to extend learning beyond the school day .PERIOD
So we thought ,COMMA what if you could bring back shop class ,COMMA but this time orient the projects around things that the community needed ,COMMA and to infuse shop class with a more critical and creative-design-thinking studio process .PERIOD
So over the course of two semesters ,COMMA the Fall and the Spring ,COMMA the students spend three hours a day every single day in our 4500 square foot studio/shop space .PERIOD
So what Studio H might offer her is a way to develop skills so that she might give back in the most meaningful way .PERIOD
So for him ,COMMA Studio H offers him a way to develop the skills he will need as an architect ,COMMA everything from drafting to wood and metal construction to how to do research for a client .PERIOD
And going out into the community and interviewing your neighbors about what kind of food they buy and from where and why -- that's a homework assignment .PERIOD
Because ,COMMA when you zoom out that far ,COMMA you lose the ability to view people as humans .PERIOD
If you are a blind child in India ,COMMA you will very likely have to contend with at least two big pieces of bad news .PERIOD
So I felt that I needed to do two things .PERIOD
Here's the eye with the opaque lens ,COMMA the opaque lens extracted and an acrylic lens inserted .PERIOD
In fact ,COMMA the story holds true even if you have a person who got sight after several years of deprivation .PERIOD
So ,COMMA the way we study that is ,COMMA let's say we find a child who has light sensitivity .PERIOD
And we've used this general approach to study many different visual proficiencies ,COMMA but I want to highlight one particular one ,COMMA and that is image parsing into objects .PERIOD
So ,COMMA any image of the kind that you see on the left ,COMMA be it a real image or a synthetic image ,COMMA it's made up of little regions that you see in the middle column ,COMMA regions of different colors ,COMMA different luminances .PERIOD
And nobody knows how this integration happens ,COMMA and that's the question we asked with Project Prakash .PERIOD
Doctor :COLON What are their shapes ?QUESTIONMARK
Doctor :COLON Now ?QUESTIONMARK
So we are creating Dylan ,COMMA which is a computational system with an ambitious goal of taking in visual inputs of the same kind that a human child would receive ,COMMA and autonomously discovering :COLON What are the objects in this visual input ?QUESTIONMARK
Here's what a baby-cam video looks like .PERIOD
What's amazing is that working with such highly degraded input ,COMMA the baby ,COMMA very quickly ,COMMA is able to discover meaning in such input .PERIOD
Even before the ball gets to a place ,COMMA the child is already looking there .PERIOD
So ,COMMA to summarize :COLON Prakash ,COMMA in its five years of existence ,COMMA it's had an impact in multiple areas ,COMMA ranging from basic neuroscience plasticity and learning in the brain ,COMMA to clinically relevant hypotheses like in autism ,COMMA the development of autonomous machine vision systems ,COMMA education of the undergraduate and graduate students ,COMMA and most importantly in the alleviation of childhood blindness .PERIOD
You know ,COMMA he's thinking ,COMMA What am I getting myself into ?QUESTIONMARK
And he said ,COMMA No ,COMMA no ,COMMA really .PERIOD You can .PERIOD
And no disabled person had ever done that -- run at a collegiate level .PERIOD
It was really ,COMMA really hot .PERIOD
And it's the first -- I had just gotten these new sprinting legs that you see in that bio ,COMMA and I didn't realize at that time that the amount of sweating I would be doing in the sock -- it actually acted like a lubricant and I'd be ,COMMA kind of ,COMMA pistoning in the socket .PERIOD
He kept me on the right track .PERIOD
Everyone was taking pictures -- What is this girl running on ?QUESTIONMARK
I'm sitting there ,COMMA like ,COMMA Oh ,COMMA my god .PERIOD Oh ,COMMA my god .PERIOD
So they call us out and ,COMMA you know -- Ladies ,COMMA you have one minute .PERIOD
And I had to think ,COMMA Why did I do this ?QUESTIONMARK
You know ,COMMA show us more than one set of legs .PERIOD
No ,COMMA these are my cosmetic legs ,COMMA actually ,COMMA and they're absolutely beautiful .PERIOD
It has a shock absorber in it so it ,COMMA like ,COMMA Shhhh ,COMMA makes this neat sound when you jump around on it .PERIOD All right .PERIOD
In these .PERIOD
For me ,COMMA while I'm such a serious athlete on the track ,COMMA I want to be feminine off the track ,COMMA and I think it's so important not to be limited in any capacity ,COMMA whether it's ,COMMA you know ,COMMA your mobility or even fashion .PERIOD
I mean ,COMMA I love the fact that I can go in anywhere and pick out what I want -- the shoes I want ,COMMA the skirts I want -- and I'm hoping to try to bring these over here and make them accessible to a lot of people .PERIOD
Two weeks ago ,COMMA Aimee was up for the Arthur Ashe award at the ESPYs .PERIOD
They didn't even want to touch that one .PERIOD They just did it .PERIOD
What we're looking at here is the insidious cost of ringtone piracy .PERIOD
But now you can find out all about -- unfortunately ,COMMA my weight is a little higher than that ,COMMA but -- all about what happens .PERIOD
So I think in terms of the fact that math has been liberated from calculating .PERIOD
It's the chore .PERIOD
Computers allow us to do that -- and this is not a small problem by any means .PERIOD
That's an amazing amount of human endeavor .PERIOD
And I'll say ,COMMA Hmm ,COMMA not sure .PERIOD I'll think about it roughly .PERIOD
Well one of them is ,COMMA they say ,COMMA you need to get the basics first .PERIOD
That somehow ,COMMA if you use a computer ,COMMA it's all mindless button-pushing ,COMMA but if you do it by hand ,COMMA it's all intellectual .PERIOD
Might have been 50 years ago ,COMMA but it isn't anymore .PERIOD
Why are we using computers to show a student how to solve a problem by hand that the computer should be doing anyway ?QUESTIONMARK
Same principles applied -- calculations ,COMMA harder .PERIOD
So the problem we've really got in math education is not that computers might dumb it down ,COMMA but that we have dumbed-down problems right now .PERIOD
So if you go through lots of examples ,COMMA you can get the answer ,COMMA you can understand how the basics of the system work better .PERIOD
So programming is the way I think we should be doing that .PERIOD
This was an example I built for my daughter .PERIOD
You can see that this is a very early step into limits and differential calculus and what happens when you take things to an extreme -- and very small sides and a very large number of sides .PERIOD
And yet ,COMMA that's a really important practical view of the world .PERIOD
It's like the land and the king they're inseparable ,COMMA they are one .PERIOD
The contract is the same as with real word objects in real world containers .PERIOD
And finally ,COMMA to pull out all the stops ,COMMA this is a system called Urp ,COMMA for urban planners ,COMMA in which we give architects and urban planners back the models that we confiscated when we insisted that they use CAD systems .PERIOD
It projects down digital shadows ,COMMA as you see here .PERIOD
There are inter-shadowing studies that children can operate ,COMMA even though they don't know anything about urban planning :COLON To move a building ,COMMA you simply reach out your hand and you move the building .PERIOD
This work is 15 years old .PERIOD
And the great thing about it was that Alex was so dedicated to the idea of verisimilitude ,COMMA the idea that the putative 2054 that we were painting in the film be believable ,COMMA that he allowed us to take on that design work as if it were an R&ampD effort .PERIOD
And the result is sort of gratifyingly perpetual .PERIOD
People still reference those sequences in Minority Report when they talk about new UI design .PERIOD
These are logistics elements that are scattered across the United States .PERIOD
This is a system called TAMPER ,COMMA which is a slightly whimsical look at what the future of editing and media manipulation systems might be .PERIOD
We'll go over to Jacques Tati here and grab our blue friend and put him down on the table as well .PERIOD
Let me leave with one final thought ,COMMA and that is that one of the greatest English language writers of the last three decades suggested that great art is always a gift .PERIOD
Can it be for every man ,COMMA or is this just for corporations and movie producers ?QUESTIONMARK
That's our goal entirely .PERIOD
So this is the inevitability about it .PERIOD
I just like to dive right in and become sort of a human guinea pig .PERIOD
It was a wonderful experience .PERIOD
You can just Google it .PERIOD
As I say in my book ,COMMA I'm Jewish in the same way the Olive Garden is Italian .PERIOD
The first thing I did was I got a stack of bibles .PERIOD
I had Christian bibles .PERIOD
So ,COMMA I wanted to follow that rule .PERIOD
And there were two types of laws that were particularly challenging .PERIOD
But it's a big part of the Bible ,COMMA so I figured I had to address it .PERIOD
I wanted to see how dressing biblically affected my mind .PERIOD
And I explained my project ,COMMA and he said ,COMMA Well ,COMMA I am an adulterer ,COMMA are you going to stone me ?QUESTIONMARK
They really did a fantastic job .PERIOD
I wanted it to be about religion in America .PERIOD
So ,COMMA this was very inspiring to me .PERIOD
I recommend Jim Wallis and Tony Campolo .PERIOD
They're very inspiring leaders ,COMMA even though I disagree with much of what they say .PERIOD
And I would say ,COMMA But that's crazy .PERIOD
The key is to pick and choose the right parts .PERIOD
There's the phrase called cafeteria religion ,COMMA and the fundamentalists will use it in a denigrating way ,COMMA and they'll say ,COMMA Oh ,COMMA it's just cafeteria religion .PERIOD
You're just picking and choosing .PERIOD
The story starts in Kenya in December of 2007 ,COMMA when there was a disputed presidential election ,COMMA and in the immediate aftermath of that election ,COMMA there was an outbreak of ethnic violence .PERIOD
And she quickly said ,COMMA It's too much .PERIOD
And enough people looked at it and found it valuable enough that the programmers who created Ushahidi decided they were going to make it open source and turn it into a platform .PERIOD
And it represents the ability of the world's population to volunteer and to contribute and collaborate on large ,COMMA sometimes global ,COMMA projects .PERIOD
And once they've done it ,COMMA they can do it again ,COMMA and they could work on getting it better .PERIOD
Even with the sacred printing press ,COMMA we got erotic novels 150 years before we got scientific journals .PERIOD
So before I talk about what is ,COMMA I think ,COMMA the critical difference between LOLcats and Ushahidi ,COMMA I want to talk about their shared source .PERIOD
At pick-up time the teachers ,COMMA who have been with your children all day ,COMMA would like you to be there at the appointed hour to take your children back .PERIOD
Late pick-ups went up every week for the next four weeks until they topped out at triple the pre-fine average ,COMMA and then they fluctuated at between double and triple the pre-fine average for the life of the fine .PERIOD
They were operating with social constraints rather than contractual ones .PERIOD
It's value created by the participants but enjoyed by society as a whole .PERIOD
The goals set out by Ushahidi are not just to make life better for the participants ,COMMA but to make life better for everyone in the society in which Ushahidi is operating .PERIOD
We've got a choice before us .PERIOD
And may it run forever ,COMMA because it gives people like me a living .PERIOD
There were two Sundays in between .PERIOD But of course ,COMMA Sundays are church days ,COMMA so you don't play on Sundays .PERIOD And one day it rained ,COMMA so they all sat around making friends with each other .PERIOD
And then you worked out your strategy ,COMMA and you came and fought the next day ,COMMA and you went back home again .PERIOD
Take a look :COLON You could play it in the dump with some rocks over there ,COMMA you could play it in a little alley -- you couldn't hit square anywhere ,COMMA because the bat hit the wall ;SEMICOLON don't forget the air conditioning and the cable wires .PERIOD
As you can see ,COMMA you can play anywhere .PERIOD
And we won this World Cup in 1983 .PERIOD
And so we allowed multinationals into India .PERIOD
We cut customs duties ,COMMA we reduced import duties ,COMMA and we got all the multinationals coming in ,COMMA with multinational budgets ,COMMA who looked at per-capita income and got very excited about the possibilities in India ,COMMA and were looking for a vehicle to reach every Indian .PERIOD
But what a game we had ,COMMA M .PERIOD S .PERIOD Dhoni got it right in the air ,COMMA but Misbah-ul-Haq ,COMMA what a player .PERIOD
A massive ,COMMA massive success :COLON India ,COMMA the world TT champions .PERIOD
So ,COMMA it was a different India .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA all of the sudden ,COMMA if you were to bowl a shot -- if Mumbai were to bowl a shot ,COMMA for example ,COMMA they needn't go to Kalbadevi or Shivaji Park or somewhere to source them ,COMMA they could go to Trinidad .PERIOD
So ,COMMA he played in Hyderabad ,COMMA went ,COMMA straight after the game ,COMMA went from the stadium to Hyderabad airport ,COMMA sat in a private corporate jet -- first refueling in Portugal ,COMMA second refueling in Brazil ;SEMICOLON he was in West Indies in time .PERIOD
They started going to the cricket to watch Shah Rukh Khan .PERIOD
For a long time ,COMMA India was this country of poverty ,COMMA dust ,COMMA beggars ,COMMA snake charmers ,COMMA filth ,COMMA Delhi belly -- people heard Delhi belly stories before they came .PERIOD
Hopefully ,COMMA it'll make everyone richer ,COMMA hopefully it'll make the game bigger and hopefully it'll give cricket commentators more time in the business .PERIOD
We all make decisions every day ;SEMICOLON we want to know what the right thing is to do -- in domains from the financial to the gastronomic to the professional to the romantic .PERIOD
And surely ,COMMA if somebody could really tell us how to do exactly the right thing at all possible times ,COMMA that would be a tremendous gift .PERIOD
This is what statisticians technically call a damn fine bet .PERIOD
Calculating odds would seem to be something rather easy :COLON there are six sides to a die ,COMMA two sides to a coin ,COMMA 52 cards in a deck .PERIOD
It's because the mind recalls words by their first letter .PERIOD
Why in the world would anybody ever play the lottery ?QUESTIONMARK
Well ,COMMA there are many answers ,COMMA but one answer surely is ,COMMA we see a lot of winners .PERIOD Right ?QUESTIONMARK When this couple wins the lottery ,COMMA or Ed McMahon shows up at your door with this giant check -- how the hell do you cash things that size ,COMMA I don't know .PERIOD
When was the last time that you saw extensive interviews with everybody who lost ?QUESTIONMARK
You can't say to yourself ,COMMA I'm as likely to win as anybody ,COMMA because you're not as likely to win as Leroy .PERIOD
Because they had the sense that declining wages are worse than rising wages ,COMMA even when the total amount of wages is higher in the declining period .PERIOD Here's another nice example .PERIOD
Here's a $ 2000 Hawaiian vacation package ;SEMICOLON it's now on sale for 1600 .PERIOD
This tendency to compare to the past is causing people to pass up the better deal .PERIOD In other words ,COMMA a good deal that used to be a great deal is not nearly as good as an awful deal that was once a horrible deal .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA just in case you're not getting it ,COMMA here's a schematic of what happened ,COMMA OK ?QUESTIONMARK
The difference is that when you lost the ticket you say to yourself ,COMMA I'm not paying twice for the same thing .PERIOD
Nonetheless ,COMMA their predictions are perverted by a comparison that then does not carry through and change their experience .PERIOD
When you go to buy groceries with it ,COMMA it doesn't go ,COMMA I'm the money saved on the car stereo ,COMMA or ,COMMA I'm the dumb money saved on the car .PERIOD It's money .PERIOD
And if a drive across town is worth 100 bucks ,COMMA it's worth 100 bucks no matter what you're saving it on .PERIOD People don't think that way .PERIOD
Well ,COMMA by and large people are enormously impatient .PERIOD
Imagine that you can have 50 dollars in a year -- that's 12 months -- or 60 dollars in 13 months .PERIOD
This is just a graph showing the results that I just suggested you would show if I gave you time to respond ,COMMA which is ,COMMA people find that the subjective value of 50 is higher than the subjective value of 60 when they'll be delivered in now or one month ,COMMA respectively -- a 30 -day delay -- but they show the reverse pattern when you push the entire decision off into the future a year .PERIOD
What causes the bug ?QUESTIONMARK Is it the drama of the event -- that it's so spectacular ?QUESTIONMARK
I don't want to say -- please ,COMMA I'm going to get quoted somewhere as saying ,COMMA Terrorism is fine and we shouldn't be so distressed .PERIOD
What I'm saying is that ,COMMA surely ,COMMA rationally ,COMMA our distress about things that happen ,COMMA about threats ,COMMA should be roughly proportional to the size of those threats and threats to come .PERIOD
There's no question .PERIOD
And so we evolved these responses .PERIOD
It turns out that the value of buying a lottery ticket is not winning .PERIOD
That's what you think it is .PERIOD All right ?QUESTIONMARK
And as a result ,COMMA many people look at economists as stupid people .PERIOD
It's the sequel to An Inconvenient Truth ,COMMA and it explores all the solutions that will solve the climate crisis .PERIOD
Or ,COMMA we can scroll through the pages at the bottom .PERIOD
Mike Matas :COLON And so throughout the whole book ,COMMA Al Gore will walk you through and explain the photos .PERIOD
This photo ,COMMA you can you can even see on an interactive map .PERIOD
And while it's playing ,COMMA we can pinch and peak back at the page ,COMMA and the movie keeps playing .PERIOD
This is very strange for me ,COMMA because I’m not used to doing this :COLON I usually stand on the other side of the light ,COMMA and now I'm feeling the pressure I put other people into .PERIOD And it's hard .PERIOD
So ,COMMA we’ll go with the first piece .PERIOD
Court :COLON I don't want to get rid of you .PERIOD
Boy :COLON Look man ,COMMA reading don't feed no one .PERIOD
Boy :COLON Arguing with you is a waste of time ,COMMA Marcus .PERIOD
Marcus :COLON When a man resorts to profanities ,COMMA it’s a sure sign of his inability to express himself .PERIOD
Did you ever move your fuckin' ass from Hollywood to go and film something real ?QUESTIONMARK
The first piece was ,COMMA really ,COMMA there's a young woman talking about Nigeria ,COMMA that she has a feeling she'll be happy there .PERIOD
So that whole thing ,COMMA that whole childhood echoes and takes me into the next piece .PERIOD
Commander :COLON Soldiers ,COMMA you are going to fight a battle ,COMMA so you must get ready and willing to die .PERIOD
C :COLON Success ,COMMA the change is only coming through the barrel of the gun .PERIOD
I don’t remember how we got there .PERIOD
The injection made us not to have mind .PERIOD

Thank you .PERIOD
In the process of my research ,COMMA I actually spent a bit of time in Sierra Leone researching this .PERIOD
I met psychosocial workers who worked with them .PERIOD
Frank Gehry :COLON I listened to this scientist this morning .PERIOD
I mean it is astonishing for an artist ,COMMA for an architect ,COMMA to become actually an icon and a legend in their own time .PERIOD
And I realized when I'd come into the meetings with these corrugated metal and chain link stuff ,COMMA and people would just look at me like I'd just landed from Mars .PERIOD
And like the playwright said the other day -- I could relate to him :COLON you're not sure .PERIOD
Yeah .PERIOD
There aren't many people around that are really involved with architecture as clients .PERIOD
If you think about the world ,COMMA and even just in this audience ,COMMA most of us are involved with buildings .PERIOD
I knew Craig and respected him .PERIOD
I knew you'd ask that question .PERIOD
I tried to understand that language as a beginning ,COMMA as a place to jump off ,COMMA and there was so much of it being done by spec builders and it was trivialized so much that it wasn't .PERIOD
Siza ,COMMA on the other hand ,COMMA continued in Portugal where the real stuff was and evolved a modern language that relates to that historic language .PERIOD
I tried to get him a couple of jobs and they didn't pan out .PERIOD
Where you .PERIOD It's like jazz :COLON you improvise ,COMMA you work together ,COMMA you play off each other ,COMMA you make something ,COMMA they make something .PERIOD
Richard Koshalek :COLON [Unclear] starts from 2004 .PERIOD

I'd seen drawings you had presented here at TED .PERIOD

You've all heard the Frank Lloyd Wright story ,COMMA when the woman called and said ,COMMA Mr .PERIOD Wright ,COMMA I'm sitting on the couch and the water's pouring in on my head .PERIOD
RSW :COLON Didn't get a laugh .PERIOD
What do you bring to it ?QUESTIONMARK
That's what reminded me of it .PERIOD
Just before going to lunch with the mayor ,COMMA we went to the harbor commissioner .PERIOD
We sat down ,COMMA and we had a drink of water and everybody was quiet .PERIOD
So ,COMMA I got up .PERIOD
They just brought us there to hustle this group ,COMMA you know ,COMMA to create a project .PERIOD
Because I want to get a standing ovation like everybody ,COMMA so .PERIOD
But ,COMMA reliable Dutchman -- -- Fantastic !EXCLAMATIONMARK
And this was the text -- In words as fashion the same rule will hold/ Alike fantastic if too new or old/ Be not the first by whom the new are tried/ Nor yet the last to lay the old aside .PERIOD
So ,COMMA it was going nowhere .PERIOD
That's what happens .PERIOD
Silas usually has a better touch with his choice of quotations .PERIOD
Don't be trendy if you want to be serious .PERIOD
But ,COMMA we don't have time .PERIOD
There were 10 artists invited to participate in it ,COMMA and it was one of those things where it was extremely competitive and I didn't want to be embarrassed ,COMMA so I worked very hard on this .PERIOD
But I was absolutely stuck on the idea of art is and trying to determine what art was .PERIOD
We've watched the financial markets that we uniquely create -- these markets that were supposed to be foolproof -- we've watched them kind of collapse before our eyes .PERIOD
And of course ,COMMA if we are put in environments where we can't deal with it ,COMMA in some sense makes sense that we actually might mess certain things up .PERIOD
It feels like we might almost just be built to make errors in certain ways .PERIOD
So this is the question my students and I wanted to get at .PERIOD
What if we put Holly into the same context as humans ?QUESTIONMARK
Because ,COMMA you know ,COMMA it's great for us ,COMMA but bad for humans .PERIOD
They were these kind of weird things .PERIOD
So the monkeys get really good at this .PERIOD
The monkeys would rip-off the tokens at every available opportunity -- from each other ,COMMA often from us -- you know ,COMMA things we didn't necessarily think we were introducing ,COMMA but things we spontaneously saw .PERIOD
We were a little impatient so we wanted to sort of speed things up a bit .PERIOD
Sounds great ,COMMA but you get one more choice to earn a little bit more money .PERIOD
Your other option is a bit safe .PERIOD Your just going to get some money for sure .PERIOD
So see what your intuition is here .PERIOD
Most people say ,COMMA why should I be risky when I can get 1500 dollars for sure ?QUESTIONMARK
And now imagine that I have you make another choice But this time ,COMMA it's a little bit worse .PERIOD
They actually tend to go a little risky .PERIOD
And this means that sometimes we'll actually switch our preferences to avoid this .PERIOD
What you saw in that last scenario is that subjects get risky because they want the small shot that there won't be any loss .PERIOD
They're why stock investors hold onto losing stocks longer -- because they're evaluating them in relative terms .PERIOD
The question we were interested in is whether the monkeys show the same biases .PERIOD
Sometimes the monkeys get no bonus -- so this is a bonus of zero .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA the monkeys meet two guys who aren't giving them bonuses ;SEMICOLON they're actually giving them less than they expect .PERIOD
So ,COMMA you know ,COMMA a little bad -- Sorry ,COMMA sorry ,COMMA sorry .PERIOD
When you're watching your stocks plummet into the red ,COMMA when you're watching your house price go down ,COMMA you're not going to be able to see that in anything but old evolutionary terms .PERIOD
But we have to recognize that we have those limitations .PERIOD
We have this Great North .PERIOD And there was a pretty small population ,COMMA and my father was an avid outdoorsman .PERIOD
But what I think it was telling me is that we are this transient thing that's happening ,COMMA and that the nature that you see out there -- the untouched shorelines ,COMMA the untouched forest that I was able to see -- really bring in a sense of that geological time ,COMMA that this has gone on for a long time ,COMMA and we're experiencing it in a different way .PERIOD
This rebirth of grass .PERIOD And then I went out for years trying to photograph the pristine landscape .PERIOD
So there's this thing that is pulling me in both directions .PERIOD
But we've become totally disconnected from them .PERIOD
That if we keep putting things ,COMMA through industrial and urban existence ,COMMA back into the system -- if we keep doing that -- we can continue on .PERIOD
Because I think everything that we're involved in -- our clothing ,COMMA our cars ,COMMA our roads ,COMMA and everything -- are directly a result .PERIOD
I'm going to move to some pictures of China .PERIOD
So this created a reservoir 600 kilometers long ,COMMA one of the largest reservoirs ever created .PERIOD
And again ,COMMA the rebuilding of the city -- to me ,COMMA it was sad to see that they didn't really grab a lot of ,COMMA I guess ,COMMA what we know here ,COMMA in terms of urban planning .PERIOD
This is a shot in one of the biggest squares in Guangdong -- and this is where a lot of migrant workers are coming in from the country .PERIOD
So this is a pink uniform at this factory .PERIOD It's a shoe factory .PERIOD
And they have dorms for the workers .PERIOD
This is one with 45000 ,COMMA so every lunch ,COMMA there's about 12000 coming through for lunch .PERIOD
They sit down ;SEMICOLON they have about 20 minutes .PERIOD
They're not getting enough ,COMMA so they're not going to move .PERIOD
Shanghai was a very intriguing city -- it's exploding on a level that I don't think any city has experienced .PERIOD
In fact ,COMMA even Shenzhen ,COMMA the economic zone -- one of the first ones -- 15 years ago was about 100000 people ,COMMA and today it boasts about 10 to 11 million .PERIOD
So this is three of the visible blast furnaces within that shot .PERIOD
I think one of the issues that we here are facing with China ,COMMA is that they're using a lot of the latest production technology .PERIOD
But that is the trick that they've got right now ,COMMA that they're winning with ,COMMA is that they're using all the latest technologies and extrusion machines ,COMMA and bringing all the components into play ,COMMA but the assembly is where they're actually bringing in -- the country workers are very willing to work .PERIOD They want to work .PERIOD
I had to have them freeze for 10 seconds to get this shot .PERIOD
There are 500 of these machines ;SEMICOLON they're worth about 200000 dollars each .PERIOD
So you have about 12 people running this ,COMMA and they're just inspecting it -- and they're just walking the lines .PERIOD
This was one of the biggest factories I've ever seen .PERIOD
But this is what happens to most of the computers .PERIOD
And as much as there are great things around the corner -- and it's palpable in this room -- of all of the things that are just about to break that can solve so many problems ,COMMA I'm really hoping that those things will spread around the world and will start to have a positive effect .PERIOD
Some of you might know ,COMMA he's a TEDster -- Stephen Sagmeister and I are working on some layouts .PERIOD And this is still in preliminary stages ;SEMICOLON these aren't the finals .PERIOD But these images ,COMMA with Worldchangingcom ,COMMA can be placed into any kind of media .PERIOD
So we're looking at this as trying to build out .PERIOD
And anything that you can do to promote that would be fantastic .PERIOD
That would be fantastic .PERIOD So those are my three wishes .PERIOD
And I'd like to start at the very beginning .PERIOD
The more stuff that's mine ,COMMA the better .PERIOD
And of course ,COMMA it's your stuff if it's broken .PERIOD
And they extract the metals by hand .PERIOD
So about 20 years ago ,COMMA I literally started in my garage tinkering around ,COMMA trying to figure out how to separate these very similar materials from each other ,COMMA and eventually enlisted a lot of my friends ,COMMA in the mining world actually ,COMMA and in the plastics world ,COMMA and we started going around to mining laboratories around the world .PERIOD
And instead of plopping down several hundred million dollars to build a chemical plant that will only make one type of plastic for its entire life ,COMMA our plants can make any type of plastic we feed them .PERIOD
We use a very highly automated process to sort those plastics ,COMMA not only by type ,COMMA but by grade .PERIOD
So I hope I've changed the way you look at at least some of the stuff in your life .PERIOD
Mother nature wastes very little ,COMMA reuses practically everything .PERIOD
And I hope that you stop looking at yourself as a consumer -- that's a label I've always hated my entire life -- and think of yourself as just using resources in one form ,COMMA until they can be transformed to another form for another use later in time .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA it was not always wonderful at that table .PERIOD
In fact ,COMMA you could come down to the tree to get your gifts and get ready to sing ,COMMA and then get ready for breakfast without even taking a bath or getting dressed ,COMMA except that daddy messed it up .PERIOD
Now that's compassion .PERIOD
So ,COMMA let me tell you ,COMMA I kind of look at the world this way .PERIOD
I see -- always ,COMMA it stirs my heart -- a picture of Dr .PERIOD Martin Luther King ,COMMA Jr .PERIOD
This is the picture .PERIOD They said ,COMMA It's going to be too volatile for you to go .PERIOD
We are so connected that we must treat each other as if an action toward you is an action toward myself .PERIOD
And whatever else is needed ,COMMA I will provide it and pay for it when I return .PERIOD
This always seemed to me to be a deepening of the sense of what it means to be a Good Samaritan .PERIOD
But now ,COMMA to be a Good Samaritan -- and I always say ,COMMA and to be a good American -- for me ,COMMA is not simply to congratulate myself for the individual acts of care .PERIOD
And if mama eternal has taught us correctly ,COMMA this song will make sense ,COMMA not only to those of us who are a part of this gathering ,COMMA but to all who sign the charter for compassion .PERIOD
I just want to say my name is Emmanuel Jal .PERIOD
And also telling it like now .PERIOD
And also ,COMMA the easiest one was when I was doing it in form of a music .PERIOD
I wanted to revenge for my village .PERIOD
My every moment .PERIOD
Run ,COMMA duck ,COMMA play dead and hide .PERIOD
But still as I wonder ,COMMA I won't go under .PERIOD
I was ready to eat .PERIOD
Give us tools .PERIOD Give the farmers tools .PERIOD
And now we have a couple in university .PERIOD
♫ What would I be ?QUESTIONMARK ♫ ♫ If Emma never rescued me ?QUESTIONMARK ♫ ♫ What would I be ?QUESTIONMARK ♫ ♫ Another starving refugee ♫ ♫ What would I be ?QUESTIONMARK ♫ ♫ If Emma never rescued me ?QUESTIONMARK ♫ ♫ Yeah ,COMMA Yeah ♫ ♫ Yeah ,COMMA I would have probably died from starvation ♫ ♫ Or some other wretched disease ♫ ♫ I would have grown up with no education ♫ ♫ Just another refugee ♫ Thank you .PERIOD
We've used fear ,COMMA if you like ,COMMA to grab people's attention .PERIOD
A deer freezes very ,COMMA very still ,COMMA poised to run away .PERIOD
And I think that's what we're doing when we're asking people to engage with our agenda around environmental degradation and climate change .PERIOD
And unsurprisingly ,COMMA people all around the world say that what they want is happiness ,COMMA for themselves ,COMMA for their families ,COMMA their children ,COMMA their communities .PERIOD
Okay ,COMMA they think money is slightly important .PERIOD
It thinks in terms of how much bang do we get for our buck .PERIOD
They are doing that on a quarter of the resources that are used typically in [the] Western world -- a quarter of the resources .PERIOD
What's happening in Costa Rica ?QUESTIONMARK
99 percent of their electricity comes from renewable resources .PERIOD
And so in strict happy-planet methodology ,COMMA we've become less efficient at turning our ultimate scarce resource into the outcome we want to .PERIOD
A child entering school today will be my age in 2050 .PERIOD
And I put it to you ,COMMA that is not business as usual .PERIOD
I think we want the lot of humanity to keep on increasing .PERIOD
And the point of these is they are ,COMMA not quite ,COMMA the secrets of happiness ,COMMA but they are things that I think happiness will flow out the side from .PERIOD
Keep building them .PERIOD
The second one is be active .PERIOD
Based on a lot of evidence for mindfulness ,COMMA cognitive behavioral therapy ,COMMA [very] strong for our well being .PERIOD
They don't need a lot of material goods to be satisfied .PERIOD
All that being good and no real credit for it .PERIOD
So I said ,COMMA Well ,COMMA Mom and Dad ,COMMA what about Santa Claus ?QUESTIONMARK
Santa would come to our house while we were at nine o'clock high mass on Christmas morning ,COMMA but only if all of us kids did not make a fuss .PERIOD
There's only one obvious conclusion to reach from this mountain of evidence :COLON our family was too strange and weird for even Santa Claus to come visit ,COMMA and my poor parents were trying to protect us from the embarrassment ,COMMA this humiliation of rejection by Santa ,COMMA who was jolly -- but ,COMMA let's face it ,COMMA he was also very judgmental .PERIOD
They had to fit two criteria :COLON they had to be old enough to be able to understand the whole concept of the age of reason ,COMMA and not yet seven .PERIOD
I just realized that the age of reason starts when you turn seven ,COMMA and then you're capable of committing any and all sins against God and man .PERIOD And Bill said ,COMMA So ?QUESTIONMARK And then I said ,COMMA So ,COMMA you're six .PERIOD You have a whole year to do anything you want to and God won't notice it .PERIOD And he said ,COMMA So ?QUESTIONMARK And I said ,COMMA So ?QUESTIONMARK So everything !EXCLAMATIONMARK And I turned to run .PERIOD I was so angry with him .PERIOD
And she said ,COMMA Listen .PERIOD The cut-off date to start kindergarten was September 15 .PERIOD
So ,COMMA I took the bus downtown to get the new Libra poster .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA I was raised in the Pacific Northwest ,COMMA around a lot of Church of Latter-day Saints people and ,COMMA you know ,COMMA I've worked with them and even dated them ,COMMA but I never really knew the doctrine or what they said to people when they were out on a mission ,COMMA and I guess I was ,COMMA sort of ,COMMA curious ,COMMA so I said ,COMMA Well ,COMMA please ,COMMA come in .PERIOD And they looked really happy ,COMMA because I don't think this happens to them all that often .PERIOD
And I sat them down ,COMMA and I got them glasses of water -- OK ,COMMA I got it .PERIOD I got them glasses of water .PERIOD
And they told me this story all about this guy named Lehi ,COMMA who lived in Jerusalem in 600 BC .PERIOD
I wanted to say ,COMMA OK ,COMMA don't start with this story .PERIOD
I said ,COMMA Oh ,COMMA come on .PERIOD I mean ,COMMA even if women tried to have a baby every single year from the time they were 15 to the time they were 45 ,COMMA assuming they didn't die from exhaustion ,COMMA it still seems like some women would have some time left over to hear the word of God .PERIOD And they said ,COMMA No .PERIOD
And they said ,COMMA Oh -- hey ,COMMA well ,COMMA we also believe that when you go to heaven you get your body restored to you in its best original state .PERIOD
Or ,COMMA if you'd gone blind ,COMMA you could see .PERIOD
If someone came to my door and I was hearing Catholic theology and dogma for the very first time ,COMMA and they said ,COMMA We believe that God impregnated a very young girl without the use of intercourse ,COMMA and the fact that she was a virgin is maniacally important to us -- -- and she had a baby ,COMMA and that's the son of God ,COMMA I mean ,COMMA I would think that's equally ridiculous .PERIOD
Yes ,COMMA breast cancer .PERIOD
Overcome with the enormity of it all and the complete feeling of loss of control ,COMMA I shed copious tears and asked my dear husband ,COMMA Jayant .PERIOD
I danced between chemo and radiation cycles and badgered him to fit it to my performing dance schedule .PERIOD
It's the power of bringing ourselves to the attention of something that so animates you ,COMMA so moves you ,COMMA that something even like cancer becomes insignificant .PERIOD
It's the power of an image .PERIOD
Nobody really did anything with it ,COMMA pretty much .PERIOD
They brought all sorts of different computers with them .PERIOD
So that ,COMMA in all that diversity ,COMMA if I wanted to figure out how to build something out of a bit of this and a bit of this ,COMMA everything I looked into ,COMMA I had to connect to some new machine ,COMMA I had to learn to run some new program ,COMMA I would find the information I wanted in some new data format .PERIOD
And that is what has made it most fun .PERIOD
They're much more than we'd originally imagined when we put together the little ,COMMA initial website that we started off with .PERIOD
One of the great -- yes a lot of people have seen it -- one of the great TED Talks .PERIOD
Hans put up this presentation in which he showed ,COMMA for various different countries ,COMMA in various different colors -- he showed income levels on one axis and he showed infant mortality ,COMMA and he shot this thing animated through time .PERIOD
So ,COMMA he'd taken this data and made a presentation which just shattered a lot of myths that people had about the economics in the developing world .PERIOD
It had underground all the data OK ,COMMA data is brown and boxy and boring ,COMMA and that's how we think of it ,COMMA isn't it ?QUESTIONMARK
In this case ,COMMA Hans had put the data together he had found from all kinds of United Nations websites and things .PERIOD
We're using them for people ,COMMA we're using them for places ,COMMA we're using them for your products ,COMMA we're using them for events .PERIOD
I wrote an article entitled Linked Data a couple of years ago and soon after that ,COMMA things started to happen .PERIOD
OK ,COMMA we have to ask for raw data now .PERIOD
Practice that .PERIOD It's important because you have no idea the number of excuses people come up with to hang onto their data and not give it to you ,COMMA even though you've paid for it as a taxpayer .PERIOD
The people who are going to solve those -- the scientists -- they have half-formed ideas in their head ,COMMA they try to communicate those over the web .PERIOD
And that is what linked data is all about .PERIOD
You get this really huge power out of it .PERIOD
Then I realized that what I was getting from giving was a narcissistic hit -- that I felt good about myself .PERIOD
Right now ,COMMA as Bill McDonough has pointed out ,COMMA the objects that we buy and use have hidden consequences .PERIOD
And I spent a couple of weeks going around with a social work agency that ministered to the homeless .PERIOD And I realized seeing the homeless through their eyes that almost all of them were psychiatric patients that had nowhere to go .PERIOD They had a diagnosis .PERIOD It made me -- what it did was to shake me out of the urban trance where ,COMMA when we see ,COMMA when we're passing someone who's homeless in the periphery of our vision ,COMMA it stays on the periphery .PERIOD
One day soon after that -- it was a Friday -- at the end of the day ,COMMA I went down -- I was going down to the subway .PERIOD It was rush hour and thousands of people were streaming down the stairs .PERIOD
And ,COMMA anyway ,COMMA the next morning we had to go along to the jeweler and get it cut off .PERIOD
And then ,COMMA yes ,COMMA all these other ones as well .PERIOD I mean ,COMMA how do you do this ?QUESTIONMARK
So I suppose you're not going to be able to kick me off the stage ,COMMA since you asked the question .PERIOD
So ,COMMA just help us with some of the numbers .PERIOD
I mean ,COMMA how big is the group overall ?QUESTIONMARK
No ,COMMA I mean ,COMMA I think -- CA :COLON But is that your hair ?QUESTIONMARK
OK .PERIOD
Of course .PERIOD
Yeah ,COMMA well ,COMMA 25 years earlier ,COMMA we'd launched the Sex Pistols' God Save The Queen ,COMMA and I'd certainly never expected that 25 years later -- that she'd actually knight us .PERIOD
Well ,COMMA I got pulled out of the sea I think six times by helicopters ,COMMA so -- and each time ,COMMA I didn't expect to come home to tell the tale .PERIOD
But the ends of all those balloon trips were ,COMMA you know -- something seemed to go wrong every time ,COMMA and on that particular occasion ,COMMA the more experienced balloonist who was with me jumped ,COMMA and left me holding on for dear life .PERIOD
Yeah .PERIOD No ,COMMA I put on my oxygen mask and stood on top of the balloon ,COMMA with my parachute ,COMMA looking at the swirling clouds below ,COMMA trying to pluck up my courage to jump into the North Sea ,COMMA which -- and it was a very ,COMMA very ,COMMA very lonely few moments .PERIOD
The years -- and until I stopped looking at the polls ,COMMA you were sort of regarded as this great hero in the UK .PERIOD and elsewhere .PERIOD
OK ,COMMA this isn't exactly hardball .PERIOD OK .PERIOD
Didn't -- weren't you just terrible at school ?QUESTIONMARK
And generally ,COMMA the people would say ,COMMA oh ,COMMA well that's bad news .PERIOD
Did this really happen ?QUESTIONMARK
And making us go on wonderful ,COMMA long bike rides .PERIOD
But is there a risk here ?QUESTIONMARK
I was actually prosecuted under two quite ancient acts in the UK .PERIOD
We changed it to social diseases and people came along with acne and spots ,COMMA but nobody came with VD any more .PERIOD
And John Mortimer ,COMMA the playwright ,COMMA defended us .PERIOD
So seriously ,COMMA is there a dark side ?QUESTIONMARK
There was a nasty biography written about you by someone .PERIOD
I mean ,COMMA do you think about life balance ?QUESTIONMARK
But the problem with capitalism is extreme wealth ends up in the hands of a few people ,COMMA and therefore extreme responsibility ,COMMA I think ,COMMA goes with that wealth .PERIOD
And is there a risk that the kind of the business heroes of the West get so excited about -- I mean ,COMMA they're used to having an idea ,COMMA getting stuff done ,COMMA and they believe profoundly in their ability to make a difference in the world .PERIOD
But I think business leaders can bring their entrepreneurial know-how and help governments approach things slightly differently .PERIOD
Well ,COMMA Richard ,COMMA when I was starting off in business ,COMMA I knew nothing about it and I also was sort of -- I thought that business people were supposed to just be ruthless and that that was the only way you could have a chance of succeeding .PERIOD
So I would like to thank you for that inspiration ,COMMA and for coming to TED today .PERIOD Thank you .PERIOD
I would say with a great smile ,COMMA I will definitely pass .PERIOD
He just started asking ,COMMA Where did you buy the radio ?QUESTIONMARK How much is it ?QUESTIONMARK
And he said ,COMMA Oh ,COMMA I teach at a college of arts .PERIOD
It can be ruins ,COMMA or it can be music ,COMMA or it can be painting or drawing or writing ,COMMA whatever it is .PERIOD
But it is just a kind of trace of that time .PERIOD
So it took about 24 hours to get this line .PERIOD
So ,COMMA what we see is just what we think often ,COMMA and most of the time ,COMMA we don't see what it is .PERIOD
So this work from this period is mostly like -- you know ,COMMA this is a work called Light Makes Dark .PERIOD
This is an exact negative .PERIOD
But a solution arrived after being quiet and not working for about six ,COMMA seven months ,COMMA in the restroom ,COMMA when I was changing the air freshener that goes from solid substance to vapor .PERIOD
This is the work I made out of that material .PERIOD
So I told them ,COMMA I'd like to start an air freshener company .PERIOD
So ,COMMA I just started doing this work to inquire further about how to sculpt the space between this object and there .PERIOD
Because ,COMMA as a visual artist ,COMMA if I'm seeing this and I'm seeing that -- but how to sculpt this ,COMMA you know ?QUESTIONMARK
It's the same in marketing .PERIOD
It only took one robust observation from Copernicus to blow that idea out of the water .PERIOD
Take BP -- they spent millions of pounds over many years building up its credentials as an environmentally friendly brand ,COMMA but then one little accident .PERIOD
The same is true of marketing .PERIOD
It makes this distribution of energy a democratizing force ,COMMA which is ultimately good for your brand .PERIOD
I see you're all up on the history of hurdy-gurdy -- vielle à roue .PERIOD
It's also the only instrument that uses this kind of technique .PERIOD
And today ,COMMA the hurdy-gurdy is used in all sorts of music -- traditional folk music ,COMMA dance ,COMMA contemporary and world music -- in the UK ,COMMA in France ,COMMA in Spain and in Italy .PERIOD
But the moment you fall in love ,COMMA you become extremely sexually possessive of them .PERIOD
But the main characteristics of romantic love are craving :COLON an intense craving to be with a particular person ,COMMA not just sexually ,COMMA but emotionally .PERIOD
And then ,COMMA the very last question I would ask them -- I would always have to work myself up to this question ,COMMA because I am not a psychologist .PERIOD
The motor of the brain .PERIOD It's a drive .PERIOD
And in fact ,COMMA I think it's more powerful than the sex drive .PERIOD
You know ,COMMA you can feel it when you're just driving along in your car .PERIOD
I think romantic love evolved to enable you to focus your mating energy on just one individual at a time ,COMMA thereby conserving mating time and energy .PERIOD
They've got incredible people skills ,COMMA negotiating skills .PERIOD
They're highly imaginative .PERIOD
And -- basic math !EXCLAMATIONMARK
We are seeing the rise of female sexual expression .PERIOD
Indeed ,COMMA arranged marriages are on their way off this braid of human life .PERIOD
I even think that marriages might even become more stable because of the second great world trend .PERIOD
It may decline some more .PERIOD
Not at any time on this planet have women been so educated ,COMMA so interesting ,COMMA so capable .PERIOD
However ,COMMA there's always kinds of complications in this .PERIOD
In these three brain systems :COLON lust ,COMMA romantic love and attachment -- don't always go together .PERIOD
But I want to tell you a story about -- to illustrate .PERIOD
I've been carrying on here about the biology of love .PERIOD
And ,COMMA Wasn't that rickshaw driver handsome !EXCLAMATIONMARK
These circuits are deeply embedded in the human brain .PERIOD
They're going to survive as long as our species survives on what Shakespeare called this mortal coil .PERIOD
One of the threads that seems to have come through loud and clear in the last couple of days is this need to reconcile what the Big wants -- the Big being the organization ,COMMA the system ,COMMA the country -- and what the Small wants -- the individual ,COMMA the person .PERIOD
Charlie Ledbetter ,COMMA yesterday ,COMMA I thought ,COMMA talked very articulately about this need to bring consumers ,COMMA to bring people into the process of creating things .PERIOD
And that's what I want to talk about today .PERIOD
319 .PERIOD
I think something happens .PERIOD I think a head may appear in a second .PERIOD
We showed them the whole cut ,COMMA and they were all completely ,COMMA what is this ?QUESTIONMARK
And the point is when you lie in a hospital bed all day ,COMMA all you do is look at the roof ,COMMA and it's a really shitty experience .PERIOD
It's a history of invention based around this .PERIOD
When we actually went and watched this procedure taking place -- and I'll explain this in a second -- it became very obvious that there was a human dimension to this that they really weren't recognizing .PERIOD
Why do we line up the square milk carton with the square fence ?QUESTIONMARK
Because we kind of have to -- we're just compelled to .PERIOD
We don't know why ,COMMA but we do .PERIOD
So what is this ?QUESTIONMARK I hear you all ask .PERIOD No ,COMMA I don't .PERIOD
So what seems like a very clunky product is ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA incredibly useful .PERIOD
These guys are using this very successfully .PERIOD
How far you can anticipate ,COMMA what follows from it ,COMMA what are the threats ,COMMA what are the possibilities ,COMMA the challenges ,COMMA the opportunities ?QUESTIONMARK
And all the components are there which are now in common parlance ,COMMA in our vocabulary ,COMMA you know ,COMMA 30 -odd years later :COLON wind energy ,COMMA recycling ,COMMA biomass ,COMMA solar cells .PERIOD
For example ,COMMA if ,COMMA in that Bucky-inspired phrase ,COMMA we draw back and we look at planet Earth ,COMMA and we take a kind of typical ,COMMA industrialized society ,COMMA then the energy consumed would be split between the buildings ,COMMA 44 percent ,COMMA transport ,COMMA 34 percent ,COMMA and industry .PERIOD
If you compared Detroit with a city of a Northern European example -- and Munich is not a bad example of that ,COMMA with the greater dependence on walking and cycling -- then a city which is really only twice as dense ,COMMA is only using one-tenth of the energy .PERIOD
In other words ,COMMA you take these comparable examples and the energy leap is enormous .PERIOD
How does it affect the design of buildings ?QUESTIONMARK
The one example I take is a corporate headquarters for a company called Willis and Faber ,COMMA in a small market town in the northeast of England ,COMMA commuting distance with London .PERIOD
This building was wired for change .PERIOD
In other words ,COMMA we didn't have the technology to do what would be really interesting on that building .PERIOD
And if I fast-forward in time ,COMMA what is interesting is that the technology is now available and celebratory .PERIOD
The library of the Free University ,COMMA which opened last year ,COMMA is an example of that .PERIOD
So it's not a kind of sacrifice ,COMMA quite the reverse .PERIOD
And just to give a sort of glimpse of that technology ,COMMA the ability to plot points in the sky and to transmit ,COMMA to transfer that information now ,COMMA directly into the factory .PERIOD
For wind tunnels ,COMMA we would literally put them in a wind tunnel and blast air ,COMMA and the many kilometers of cable and so on .PERIOD
I mean ,COMMA major transformation .PERIOD
It's been well known that the Dead Sea is dying .PERIOD
How do you make them more friendly at that scale ?QUESTIONMARK
Hong Kong I refer to as a kind of analog experience in a digital age ,COMMA because you always have a point of reference .PERIOD
250 -- excuse me ,COMMA 50000 people working 24 hours ,COMMA seven days .PERIOD
Contagious is a good word .PERIOD
Laughter is contagious .PERIOD Passion is contagious .PERIOD
And that directly increased student wellbeing .PERIOD
And that can't happen in a classroom .PERIOD
And Ahmedabad got the first child-friendly zebra crossing in the world .PERIOD
Man :COLON This program is wonderful .PERIOD
We have to start collecting from 555 .PERIOD
KBS :COLON So ,COMMA the charter of compassion starts right here .PERIOD
It was incredible .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA I was paid in dollars as a consultant ,COMMA and I looked at my income tax return and tried to ask myself :COLON Is there a line in my return ,COMMA which shows how much of this income has gone to the people whose knowledge has made it possible ?QUESTIONMARK
I tried to convince myself that ,COMMA No ,COMMA no ,COMMA I have worked for the policy changes .PERIOD
And this was a moment of great pain and trauma because I couldn't live with it any longer .PERIOD
In fact ,COMMA they invite the honey bees through their colors ,COMMA and the bees don't keep all the honey for themselves .PERIOD
These are the three guiding principles of the Honey Bee Network :COLON that whenever we learn something from people it must be shared with them in their language .PERIOD
You cannot discriminate .PERIOD
I'm so sorry to say that .PERIOD
The rice that you ate in the lunch ,COMMA and you will eat today ,COMMA is transplanted by women bending in a very awkward posture ,COMMA millions of them ,COMMA every season ,COMMA in the paddy season ,COMMA when they transplant paddy with their feet in the water .PERIOD
And feet in the water will develop fungus ,COMMA infections ,COMMA and that infection pains because then other insects bite that point .PERIOD
And this is what he got painted .PERIOD
There could be nothing more wrong than the Maslowian model of hierarchy of needs because the poorest people in this country can get enlightenment .PERIOD
So here's a model where a two-wheeler washing machine .PERIOD
So it is better ,COMMA it is safer ;SEMICOLON it is affordable ,COMMA it is energy-efficient .PERIOD
So why are people willing to adjust with that mismatch ?QUESTIONMARK
For example ,COMMA cell phones :COLON We have 400 million cellphones in this country .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA the eminent model ,COMMA the long-tail model tells you that small sales of a large number of books ,COMMA for example ,COMMA having only a few copies sold can still be a viable model .PERIOD
Look at what he is doing .PERIOD
But he has modified a two-wheeler so that he can get autonomy and freedom and flexibility .PERIOD
And we have a very vibrant network in China ,COMMA particularly ,COMMA but also emerging in Brazil and other parts of the world .PERIOD
I can't change the condition of the road ,COMMA but I can make the cycle run faster .PERIOD
And this is a donkey cart which they modified .PERIOD
This is in China .PERIOD This girl needed a breathing apparatus .PERIOD
There's a whole range of innovations that we have .PERIOD
A car ,COMMA which runs on compressed air with six paisa per kilometer .PERIOD
And he didn't mean the comfort of a five-course dinner as opposed to a one-course meal ,COMMA but he really meant the comfort of the quality of the building for the people .PERIOD
So in an indirect way ,COMMA you can see the sun .PERIOD
And what they did is they created an integral building element to improve the quality of the space that surrounds the visitors of the museum .PERIOD
They created this shade that you can see here ,COMMA which actually covers the sun ,COMMA but opens up to the good light from the sky .PERIOD
They allowed themselves a few mistakes along the way .PERIOD
This is Richard Kelly who was born 100 years ago ,COMMA which is the reason I bring him up now ,COMMA because it's kind of an anniversary year .PERIOD
He meant something like this -- where the light gives direction to the space and helps you to get around .PERIOD
These three distinct elements ,COMMA together ,COMMA make a lighting environment that helps us to feel better .PERIOD
How do they share their culture ?QUESTIONMARK
The problem is though that I wanted to explain to you how this really works -- but I can have four of these on my finger ,COMMA so you would not to be able to really see them .PERIOD
So just to explain .PERIOD
Why are all these motorways permanently lit ?QUESTIONMARK
Can we maybe be much more selective and create better environments that also benefit from darkness ?QUESTIONMARK
Can we engage people more in the lighting projects that we create ,COMMA so they really want to connect with it ,COMMA like here ?QUESTIONMARK
Where have they come from ?QUESTIONMARK Where are they going ?QUESTIONMARK
And it only embodies all these stories and all this suspense because of the darkness and the light .PERIOD
They pointed out that ,COMMA I believe it was between 30 and 50 years from today ,COMMA they will be steering cars by wire ,COMMA without all that mechanical stuff .PERIOD
It really was a big idea in technology when we started applying it in the iBOT for the disabled community .PERIOD
The big idea here is ,COMMA I think ,COMMA a new piece of a solution to a fairly big problem in transportation .PERIOD
For instance ,COMMA in that time ,COMMA 91 percent of America lived either on farms or in small towns .PERIOD
So ,COMMA the car -- the horseless carriage that replaced the horse and carriage -- was a big deal ;SEMICOLON it went twice as fast as a horse and carriage .PERIOD
It all made sense ,COMMA with 91 percent of the people living there .PERIOD
Three million people die every year in cities due to bad air ,COMMA and almost all particulate pollution on this planet is produced by transportation devices ,COMMA particularly sitting in cities .PERIOD
I don't look like a motor vehicle .PERIOD
We're a recreational vehicle that doesn't really matter ,COMMA and I don't spend my time doing that kind of stuff .PERIOD
Then she looks up ,COMMA she's looking up ,COMMA and she says ,COMMA And I'm 81 years old ,COMMA and I don't drive a car anymore .PERIOD
We need water .PERIOD
We figured out how to put a vapor-compression distiller on this thing ,COMMA with a counter-flow heat exchanger to take the waste heat ,COMMA then using a little bit of the electricity control that process ,COMMA and for 450 watts ,COMMA which is a little more than half of its waste heat ,COMMA it will make 10 gallons an hour of distilled water from anything that comes into it to cool it .PERIOD
So if we put this box on here in a few years ,COMMA could we have a solution to transportation ,COMMA electricity ,COMMA and communication ,COMMA and maybe drinkable water in a sustainable package that weighs 60 pounds ?QUESTIONMARK
We tend to do any technology that we think is sufficiently important ;SEMICOLON we'll typically do it twice .PERIOD Once ,COMMA we want to do it first .PERIOD
And then it's time to do it again .PERIOD Last year .PERIOD
After it falls below a critical price ,COMMA it will tend ,COMMA if it's successful ,COMMA to rise above a critical mass ,COMMA a penetration .PERIOD

Free is something that comes with digital ,COMMA because the reproduction costs are essentially free .PERIOD It comes with IP ,COMMA because it's such an efficient protocol .PERIOD It comes with fiber optics ,COMMA because there's so much bandwidth .PERIOD
It's an economic force ;SEMICOLON it's a technical force .PERIOD
You know ,COMMA there could be a film's [unclear] there ,COMMA but it's basically ,COMMA every song ever made could be stored on 400 dollars worth of storage by 2008 .PERIOD It takes that entire element ,COMMA the physical element ,COMMA of songs off the table .PERIOD
Because of some of technologies we've been talking about .PERIOD
And by definition ,COMMA every one of you who is in this room must consider yourself a global soul ,COMMA a global citizen .PERIOD
Even more problematic ,COMMA they're not listening to poor people themselves .PERIOD
In 2002 I met this incredible entrepreneur named Amitabha Sadangi from India ,COMMA who'd been working for 20 years with some of the poorest farmers on the planet .PERIOD
And he was expressing his frustration that the aid market had bypassed low-income farmers altogether ,COMMA despite the fact that 200 million farmers alone in India make under a dollar a day .PERIOD
But the market also had bypassed low income farmers ,COMMA because these systems were both too expensive ,COMMA and they were constructed for fields that were too large .PERIOD
In fact ,COMMA when you go back to the beginning ,COMMA there were no private investors who would be willing to take a risk on building a new technology for a market class that made under a dollar a day ,COMMA that were known to be some of the most risk-averse people on the planet and that were working in one of the riskiest sectors ,COMMA agriculture .PERIOD
Secondarily ,COMMA we wanted to see if we could export this drip irrigation and bring it into other countries .PERIOD
In Arusha ,COMMA Tanzania ,COMMA A to Z Textile Manufacturing has worked in partnership with us ,COMMA with UNICEF ,COMMA with the Global Fund ,COMMA to create a factory that now employs 7000 people ,COMMA mostly women .PERIOD

During the hurricane ,COMMA you had MSNBC posting about the hurricane on their blog ,COMMA updating it frequently .PERIOD This was possible because of the easy nature of blogging tools .PERIOD
They sent a search party ,COMMA and I overheard people saying they wish I had killed myself ,COMMA jumped off Bible Peak .PERIOD
And I won it .PERIOD I reached all of these people ,COMMA and I had tens of thousands of people reading about my life everyday .PERIOD
And then I wrote a post about a banjo .PERIOD
And my husband -- this is my husband ,COMMA who is very hot -- he won an award for being hot -- -- he told me ,COMMA You cannot buy a banjo .PERIOD
And those people who know me understood my joke .PERIOD
How much money does he spend on beer in a year ?QUESTIONMARK
And then I got people saying ,COMMA Leave him .PERIOD
And why are they reading this ?QUESTIONMARK
This is not science ,COMMA but this was enough for me to be really so interested in how we have evolved and how we can trace our line .PERIOD
This is the only picture I have .PERIOD And to think of what we have the ability to do with our blogs ;SEMICOLON to think about the people who are on those $ 100 computers talking about who they are ,COMMA sharing these personal stories -- this is an amazing thing .PERIOD
And -- and so I printed out her -- or I sent a PDF of her blog to her family ,COMMA and they passed it out at her memorial service ,COMMA and even in her obituary ,COMMA they mentioned her blog because it was such a big part of her life .PERIOD
You can see in its shape and its streamlined design it's powered for ocean swimming .PERIOD
It flies through the ocean on its pectoral fins ,COMMA gets lift ,COMMA powers its movements with a lunate tail .PERIOD
This tuna symbolizes what's the problem for all of us in the room .PERIOD
So take a look at that animal .PERIOD
So in a program called Tag-A-Giant we've actually gone from Ireland to Canada ,COMMA from Corsica to Spain .PERIOD
And that's the fisheries off the state of North Carolina .PERIOD
They're coming together .PERIOD That could be tuna sex -- and there it is .PERIOD
So from data like this ,COMMA we're able now to put the map up ,COMMA and in this map you see thousands of positions generated by this decade and a half of tagging .PERIOD
Salmon sharks go down to the tropics to pup and come into Monterey .PERIOD
We just need to put it together .PERIOD
We have the technology that's shown us where it is .PERIOD
Hi there .PERIOD I'm Hasan .PERIOD I'm an artist .PERIOD
Basically this is the FBI offices in Tampa where I spent six months of my life -- back and forth ,COMMA not six months continuously .PERIOD
Or questions such as -- actually ,COMMA during the polygraph ,COMMA which was how it finally ended after nine consecutive of them -- one of the polygraph questions was .PERIOD
And it's like ,COMMA Guys ,COMMA I travel a lot .PERIOD
Don't want to make it look like I'm making any sudden moves .PERIOD
And so I just kept doing this over and over and over .PERIOD
Then I'd make websites .PERIOD
So you can see ,COMMA Delta 1252 going from Kansas City to Atlanta .PERIOD
This was on Delta 719 going from JFK to San Francisco .PERIOD
These are the airports that I hang out in ,COMMA because I like airports .PERIOD
But if you can cross-reference this with the other data ,COMMA then you're basically replaying the roll of the FBI agent and putting it all together .PERIOD
This is exactly where my old apartment in San Francisco was .PERIOD
And then sometimes you get this .PERIOD
So there's multiple databases .PERIOD
So there's different categorizations of meals eaten outside empty train stations ,COMMA empty gas stations .PERIOD
At 156 pm .PERIOD was this one .PERIOD At 459 pm .PERIOD was this one .PERIOD
Every few moments I shoot the image .PERIOD
So by me putting all this information out there ,COMMA what I'm basically telling you is I'm telling you everything .PERIOD
And the reason their information has any value is ,COMMA well ,COMMA because no one else has access to it .PERIOD
And by me cutting out the middle man and giving it straight to you ,COMMA the information that the FBI has has no value ,COMMA so thus devaluing their currency .PERIOD
So in a way ,COMMA I'm glad that I'm completely obsolete .PERIOD
And you know ,COMMA some of my friends have always said ,COMMA Hey ,COMMA you're just paranoid .PERIOD Why are you doing this ?QUESTIONMARK
So you can see that the Homeland Security likes to come by -- Department of Homeland Security .PERIOD
Bruno Giussani :COLON Hasan ,COMMA just curious .PERIOD
So it's just become another day .PERIOD
And everything's automated at the other end .PERIOD
On the day you are in a place where there is no coverage ,COMMA the FBI gets crazy ?QUESTIONMARK
Well it goes to the last point that I was at .PERIOD
Hasan ,COMMA thank you very much .PERIOD
You all know the truth of what I'm going to say .PERIOD
But first ,COMMA see what a miserable lot we are .PERIOD
Even the people just below the top have less good health than the people at the top .PERIOD
And there ,COMMA you see it in relation to the measure of inequality I've just shown you ,COMMA which I shall use over and over again in the data .PERIOD
That's very important in poorer countries ,COMMA but not in the rich developed world .PERIOD
But in the more equal societies ,COMMA it rises to 60 or 65 percent .PERIOD
This is violence .PERIOD
There's a about a tenfold difference there ,COMMA log scale up the side .PERIOD
But it goes from about 40 to 400 people in prison .PERIOD
Basically ,COMMA it's asking :COLON do rich fathers have rich sons and poor fathers have poor sons ,COMMA or is there no relationship between the two ?QUESTIONMARK
One is that ,COMMA in graph after graph ,COMMA we find the countries that do worse ,COMMA whatever the outcome ,COMMA seem to be the more unequal ones ,COMMA and the ones that do well seem to be the Nordic countries and Japan .PERIOD
It's not just one or two things that go wrong ,COMMA it's most things .PERIOD
I am not talking about perfect equality ,COMMA I'm talking about what exists in rich developed market democracies .PERIOD
It also leads to status insecurity .PERIOD
The big change in our understanding of drivers of chronic health in the rich developed world is how important chronic stress from social sources is affecting the immune system ,COMMA the cardiovascular system .PERIOD
Thank you .PERIOD
Well ,COMMA I didn't have that in mind ,COMMA so .PERIOD
The acid will ruin the gold plating .PERIOD
Beneath it is a wonderful knife .PERIOD
No .PERIOD But is it fun ?QUESTIONMARK
So I type design emotion and my website wasn't first again .PERIOD
It's so much fun to drive .PERIOD
And then ,COMMA a psychologist ,COMMA Alice Isen ,COMMA did this wonderful experiment .PERIOD
So ,COMMA she'd bring people into the room ,COMMA and there'd be a string hanging down here and a string hanging down here .PERIOD
You get a little problem ,COMMA you say ,COMMA Ah ,COMMA I'll figure it out .PERIOD
There's an amazing amount of stuff that's built into the brain .PERIOD
Behavioral is subconscious ,COMMA you're unaware of it .PERIOD
Almost everything we do is subconscious .PERIOD
And the tea is sitting in this stuff to the right -- the tea is to the right of this line .PERIOD
And the reason you might buy it now is because you care about the environment .PERIOD
The other neat thing .PERIOD
So that's the new me .PERIOD
The graph was interesting ,COMMA although you need to consider it carefully .PERIOD
It did not correlate with the size of classrooms .PERIOD
If you took the same technology and piloted it into one of those remote schools ,COMMA where the score was 30 percent ,COMMA and ,COMMA let's say ,COMMA took that up to 40 percent -- that will be a completely different thing .PERIOD
The last question is what everybody said ,COMMA but you know ,COMMA I mean ,COMMA they must have poked their head over the wall and asked the people in your office ,COMMA can you show me how to do it ,COMMA and then somebody taught him .PERIOD
He came there and he started to fiddle around with the touchpad .PERIOD
I left the computer there with lots of CDs -- I didn't have any Internet -- and came back three months later .PERIOD
And as soon as they saw me they said ,COMMA We need a faster processor and a better mouse .PERIOD
So I said ,COMMA But how did you understand what's going on over there ?QUESTIONMARK
So then I measured ,COMMA and they were using 200 English words with each other -- mispronounced ,COMMA but correct usage -- words like exit ,COMMA stop ,COMMA find ,COMMA save ,COMMA that kind of thing ,COMMA not only to do with the computer but in their day-to-day conversations .PERIOD
This is the Himalayas .PERIOD Up in the north ,COMMA very cold .PERIOD
I want to just cut this short .PERIOD We did this over and over again .PERIOD
So if they have access to the computer ,COMMA they will teach themselves ,COMMA including intelligence .PERIOD
But we got a clean learning curve ,COMMA almost exactly the same as what you would get in a school .PERIOD
I'll leave it at that ,COMMA because ,COMMA I mean ,COMMA it sort of says it all ,COMMA doesn't it ?QUESTIONMARK
An educational technology and pedagogy that is digital ,COMMA automatic ,COMMA fault-tolerant ,COMMA minimally invasive ,COMMA connected and self-organized .PERIOD
And it's about rediscovering idealism in all of that wreckage .PERIOD
I negotiated with Saddam's diplomats at the UN .PERIOD
I'd already served in Germany ,COMMA Norway ,COMMA various other places ,COMMA but I was posted to New York to serve on the UN .PERIOD Security Council for the British delegation .PERIOD
And there ,COMMA I dealt with things like the Middle East peace process ,COMMA the Lockerbie issue -- we can talk about that later ,COMMA if you wish -- but above all ,COMMA my responsibility was Iraq and its weapons of mass destruction and the sanctions we placed on Iraq to oblige it to disarm itself of these weapons .PERIOD
I decided to take a sabbatical ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA at the New School ,COMMA Bruce .PERIOD
So took a running leap and jumped over the edge of a cliff .PERIOD
But ,COMMA in a way ,COMMA I've got used to the sensation of it .PERIOD
A lot of my friends were still in it .PERIOD
It was anarchy .PERIOD
And it's a very horrible thing to see anarchy ,COMMA to know that the police and the military -- there were lots of military troops there -- actually can't stop that rampaging mob who's coming down the street .PERIOD
They were not allowed a foreign office to help them deal with this immensely complicated process ,COMMA which became known as the Final Status Process of Kosovo .PERIOD
And I came to Kosovo and advised the Kosovo government .PERIOD
If they can't do it ,COMMA who's left to deal with it ?QUESTIONMARK
So we will be bringing Darfuri rebel groups ,COMMA the Northern Cypriots and the Southern Cypriots ,COMMA rebels from Aceh ,COMMA and awful long laundry list of chaotic conflicts around the world .PERIOD
That is the politics of the 21 st century ,COMMA and in a way ,COMMA Independent Diplomat embodies that fragmentation ,COMMA that change ,COMMA that is happening to all of us .PERIOD
Now today ,COMMA we're not talking about good and bad TV .PERIOD
This is something that clearly separates us from the animal kingdom .PERIOD
Is television literally functioning as our conscience ,COMMA tempting us and rewarding us at the same time ?QUESTIONMARK
We surveyed the top- 20 Nielsen shows every year for 50 years -- a thousand shows .PERIOD
Viewers had responded dramatically .PERIOD
This was the first show that allowed viewers to say ,COMMA My God ,COMMA I can comment on how I feel about the Vietnam War ,COMMA about the presidency ,COMMA through television ?QUESTIONMARK
It can change us ?QUESTIONMARK
That's mapped against the red dot ,COMMA unemployment ,COMMA which is a simple Bureau of Labor Department statistic .PERIOD
We had the bursting of the tech bubble .PERIOD
I can vote you off the island .PERIOD
There has not been a decade of television without a definitive ,COMMA dominant TV mom .PERIOD
Maude Findlay ,COMMA the epitome of the irreverent 1970 s ,COMMA who tackled abortion ,COMMA divorce ,COMMA even menopause on TV .PERIOD
Murphy Brown took on a vice president when she took on the idea of single parenthood .PERIOD
This era's mom ,COMMA Bree Van de Kamp .PERIOD
So here's the metaphor I'm offering today .PERIOD
Previous to this time ,COMMA I was very selfish and self-righteous .PERIOD
And on this higher level he becomes loving and forgiving .PERIOD
But here's the weirdest place of all :COLON war .PERIOD
I passes insensibly into a we ,COMMA my becomes our and individual faith loses its central importance .PERIOD
Now profane is the opposite of sacred .PERIOD
It just means ordinary or common .PERIOD
Durkheim believed that anything that unites us takes on an air of sacredness .PERIOD
I'm offering the metaphor of a staircase in the mind .PERIOD
So here's the million-dollar question for social scientists like me :COLON Is the staircase a feature of our evolutionary design ?QUESTIONMARK
Or is it a bug ,COMMA a mistake in the system -- this religious stuff is just something that happens when the wires cross in the brain -- Jill has a stroke and she has this religious experience ,COMMA it's just a mistake ?QUESTIONMARK
There's a mutation in the gene and one of them mutates to follow a selfish strategy .PERIOD
It's so big and powerful and efficient that it can take resources from the greens ,COMMA from the defectors ,COMMA the cheaters .PERIOD
And pretty soon the whole population is actually composed of these new superorganisms .PERIOD
We're not locked into cooperation the way bees and ants are .PERIOD
We're bees .PERIOD We busted out of the hive during the Enlightenment .PERIOD
We unleashed Earth-changing creativity and generated vast wealth and comfort .PERIOD
What's missing ?QUESTIONMARK
And that gives me hope because people are not purely selfish .PERIOD
Every man is a piece of the continent ,COMMA a part of the main .PERIOD
Thank you .PERIOD
There was no more space in the house .PERIOD So I went out to the backyard ,COMMA and without any previous building experience ,COMMA and about 3000 dollars and some recycled materials ,COMMA I built this space .PERIOD

This is for a book by Metropolis .PERIOD
When I first contacted William Burroughs about being part of it ,COMMA he said no ;SEMICOLON he said he didn't believe it was the end of print .PERIOD
And also ,COMMA surprisingly ,COMMA it was done in kind of a cheap metal ,COMMA and it had completely rusted through ,COMMA and water everywhere ,COMMA and spiders .PERIOD
And I thought ,COMMA you know ,COMMA what were they thinking ?QUESTIONMARK
Got no way of tracking it ,COMMA so I could be totally wrong .PERIOD
I don't have the site .PERIOD It's just the piece itself .PERIOD
I found out that's very true ,COMMA working on this campaign worldwide .PERIOD
But anyway ,COMMA this is one of the ads I was most pleased with ,COMMA because they were all elaborately art-directed ,COMMA and this one I thought actually felt like the girl was looking at the computer .PERIOD
In Germany ,COMMA they made one small change without checking with me -- nor did they have to ,COMMA because it was done through agencies -- but see if you can tell the difference .PERIOD
So ,COMMA I understand their logic .PERIOD I totally disagree with it ;SEMICOLON I think it's a very small-minded approach ,COMMA the world is certainly much more global ,COMMA and I certainly think the people of Germany could have handled a little black girl sitting in front of a computer ,COMMA though we'll never know .PERIOD
Article on Bryan Ferry -- just really boring article -- so I set the whole article in Dingbat .PERIOD
It's kind of horsey type ,COMMA but the texture -- the second plane not quite hitting :COLON there was something more enticing ,COMMA if that's the right -- it's not the right word -- but in this cover than Time or Newsweek .PERIOD
It did not let up .PERIOD
There were a lot of orphans made this day ,COMMA and here's a dead body being brought out .PERIOD
This is my desktop .PERIOD
This is -- I like found art ;SEMICOLON hand lettering's coming back in a big way ,COMMA and I thought this was a great example of both .PERIOD
But I was asked to give a talk at a conference in Sacramento a few years back .PERIOD
And I remembered seeing this photograph of my father ,COMMA who was a test pilot ,COMMA and he told me that when you signed up to become a test pilot ,COMMA they told you that there was a 40 to 50 percent chance of death on the job .PERIOD
I've spent the past year thinking about what it really should be about .PERIOD
Before that ,COMMA obviously ,COMMA technology didn't exist .PERIOD But obviously it did .PERIOD
But it's still very ,COMMA very productive .PERIOD So I'm attempting to say ,COMMA if we take technology's view of the world ,COMMA what does it want ?QUESTIONMARK
And I think once we ask that question we have to go back ,COMMA actually ,COMMA to life .PERIOD Because obviously ,COMMA if we keep extending the origins of technology far back ,COMMA I think we come back to life at some point .PERIOD
Brian Farrell's work is all part of this agenda to try and actually discover all the species on Earth .PERIOD
More and more of the inert matter of the globe is being touched and animated by life .PERIOD
And the last thing ,COMMA I bring back this nudibranch .PERIOD
And so the general ,COMMA long-term trends of evolution are roughly these five :COLON ubiquity ,COMMA diversity ,COMMA specialization ,COMMA complexity and socialization .PERIOD Now ,COMMA I took that and said ,COMMA OK ,COMMA what are the long-term trends in technology ?QUESTIONMARK
That we see there's a general hammer ,COMMA and hammers become more and more specific over time .PERIOD
There's obviously diversity .PERIOD Huge numbers of things .PERIOD
So the major trends in technology evolution actually are the same as in biological evolution .PERIOD The same drives that we see towards ubiquity ,COMMA towards diversity ,COMMA towards socialization ,COMMA towards complexity .PERIOD That is maybe not a big surprise because if we map out ,COMMA say ,COMMA the evolution of armor ,COMMA you can actually follow a sort of an evolutionary-type cladistic tree .PERIOD
He has one of the world's largest collections -- about 500 of them .PERIOD
But the most interesting aspect about this is that if you look at those red lines at the bottom ,COMMA those indicate basically a parentage of a type of cornet that was no longer made .PERIOD That does not happen in biology .PERIOD
And when we take that ,COMMA we take this idea of what culture is doing and add it to what the long-term trajectory -- again ,COMMA in life's evolution -- we find that each case -- each of the major transitions in life -- what they're really about is accelerating and changing the way in which evolution happens .PERIOD
So all these steps in evolution are increasing ,COMMA basically ,COMMA the evolution of evolvability .PERIOD
So if you have life hacking -- life means hacking ,COMMA the game of survival -- then evolution is a way to extend the game by changing the rules of the game .PERIOD
And each time we make a new opportunity place ,COMMA we're allowing a platform to make new ones .PERIOD
That's what technology wants .PERIOD
I'm going ,COMMA My gosh !EXCLAMATIONMARK I had never seen anything like this in my life !EXCLAMATIONMARK
And you walk up to the front of the tank .PERIOD Then you realize that these animals all have different personalities :COLON Some of them would hold their ground ,COMMA others would slink into the back of the tank and disappear in the rocks ,COMMA and one in particular ,COMMA this amazing animal .PERIOD
And what I learned in school though was really beneficial .PERIOD
If you're a wildlife filmmaker and you're going out into the field to film animals ,COMMA especially behavior ,COMMA it helps to have a fundamental background on who these animals are ,COMMA how they work and ,COMMA you know ,COMMA a bit about their behaviors .PERIOD
So we created a way to find out ,COMMA and I got my first look at that famous beak in action .PERIOD
And octopus are ,COMMA they live in all the oceans .PERIOD
And as you go deeper ,COMMA that lovely ,COMMA blue water you were launched in gives way to darker and darker blue .PERIOD
And finally ,COMMA it's a rich lavender ,COMMA and after a couple of thousand feet ,COMMA it's ink black .PERIOD
But we're just going to zip right past this area ,COMMA this area that includes about 95 percent of the living space on our planet and go to the mid-ocean ridge ,COMMA which I think is even more extraordinary .PERIOD
And the top of this mountain range is splitting apart ,COMMA creating a rift valley .PERIOD
The surrounding water is just a couple of degrees above freezing .PERIOD
And this kind of life and death of hydrothermal vent communities is going on every 30 or 40 years all along the ridge .PERIOD
But ,COMMA encouragingly ,COMMA I've seen just the opposite .PERIOD
Well ,COMMA how it happened is the local community galvanized .PERIOD
And these problems are so large and global ,COMMA and it's just overwhelming .PERIOD
My answer to that is don't look at the big ,COMMA overwhelming issues of the world .PERIOD
And we can make changes to our behavior that will influence and affect the environment ,COMMA like those people changed the health of that bay .PERIOD
I was afraid of womanhood .PERIOD
Not that I'm not afraid now ,COMMA but I've learned to pretend .PERIOD
I've learned to be flexible .PERIOD
Back in the ' 50 s and ' 60 s ,COMMA when I was growing up ,COMMA little girls were supposed to be kind and thoughtful and pretty and gentle and soft ,COMMA and we were supposed to fit into roles that were sort of shadowy -- really not quite clear what we were supposed to be .PERIOD
Now my mother was different .PERIOD
And I just ate it up .PERIOD
Because women are on the ground floor ,COMMA and we know the traditions so well ,COMMA we can bring a different voice to the table .PERIOD
And then also my family was in chaos ,COMMA and I drew to try to bring my family together -- -- try to bring my family together with laughter .PERIOD
But I feel blessed to be able to work with them .PERIOD
Two hundred years ago ,COMMA the United States was less than a few percent urbanized .PERIOD
It's now more than 82 percent .PERIOD
Now listen to this :COLON Every week for the foreseeable future ,COMMA until 2050 ,COMMA every week more than a million people are being added to our cities .PERIOD
However ,COMMA cities ,COMMA despite having this negative aspect to them ,COMMA are also the solution .PERIOD
So we have this kind of dual nature .PERIOD
That's the quest .PERIOD
So here's two questions that I have in my head when I think about this problem .PERIOD
We use them metaphorically -- the DNA of a company ,COMMA the metabolism of a city ,COMMA and so on -- is that just bullshit ,COMMA metaphorical bullshit ,COMMA or is there serious substance to it ?QUESTIONMARK
And if that is the case ,COMMA how come that it's very hard to kill a city ?QUESTIONMARK
You could drop an atom bomb on a city ,COMMA and 30 years later it's surviving .PERIOD
This is just a tiny range actually :COLON It's us mammals ;SEMICOLON we're one of these .PERIOD
Rat ,COMMA that's a rat -- could have been you .PERIOD
We're all pretty much the same .PERIOD
And you see ,COMMA you're very familiar with this .PERIOD
Despite the fact that this is the most complex and diverse system in the universe ,COMMA there's an extraordinary simplicity being expressed by this .PERIOD
So a wonderful thing about all of biology is that it expresses an extraordinary economy of scale .PERIOD
And you're very familiar with these networks .PERIOD
And here's the summary of what I'm saying .PERIOD
Heart rates are slower ;SEMICOLON you live longer ;SEMICOLON diffusion of oxygen and resources across membranes is slower ,COMMA etc .PERIOD
Here it is ,COMMA which says that the bigger you are the more you have per capita ,COMMA unlike biology -- higher wages ,COMMA more super-creative people per capita as you get bigger ,COMMA more patents per capita ,COMMA more crime per capita .PERIOD
See companies ,COMMA they scale .PERIOD
There it is :COLON after some little fluctuations at the beginning ,COMMA when companies are innovating ,COMMA they scale beautifully .PERIOD
But you notice ,COMMA I've cheated ,COMMA because I've only gone up to ' 94 .PERIOD
And I put in front of them an authentic experience that allowed them to learn for themselves .PERIOD
The problem then becomes how do you take seventh- and eighth-graders to a talk about genocide and deal with the subject in a way that is responsible and respectful ,COMMA and they know what to do with it .PERIOD
I moved there primarily to be part of a learning environment that validated the way that I knew that kids learned ,COMMA and that really wanted to investigate what was possible when you are willing to let go of some of the paradigms of the past ,COMMA of information scarcity when my grandmother was in school and when my father was in school and even when I was in school ,COMMA and to a moment when we have information surplus .PERIOD
It asked them to create for themselves ,COMMA and it allowed them to fail ,COMMA process ,COMMA learn from .PERIOD
Ask them to go to places ,COMMA to see things for themselves ,COMMA to actually experience the learning ,COMMA to play ,COMMA to inquire .PERIOD
This is one of my favorite photos ,COMMA because this was taken on Tuesday ,COMMA when I asked the students to go to the polls .PERIOD
There are words that we're truly afraid of .PERIOD
This was an issue from 2002 that they published with a lot of different articles on the bionic human .PERIOD
Regenerative medicine is what Business Week put up when they did a story about regenerative medicine not too long ago .PERIOD

In 2010 ,COMMA two workers per retiree in the US .PERIOD

There go the cells .PERIOD
Here's another example of stem-cell therapy that isn't quite clinical yet ,COMMA but I think very soon will be .PERIOD
So you could go in ,COMMA you could get your tummy-tuck .PERIOD
Japan is the oldest country on earth in terms of its average age .PERIOD
In the United States we've had a somewhat different approach .PERIOD
But there's been no strategic investment to bring all of the necessary things to bear and focus them in a careful way .PERIOD
And these TEDsters are -- you know ,COMMA as innocent as that name sounds -- these are the philanthropists and artists and scientists who sort of shape our world .PERIOD
And what could I possibly have to say that would be distinguished enough to justify my participation in something like that ?QUESTIONMARK
Well my characters ,COMMA like the ones in my shows ,COMMA allow me to play with the spaces between those questions .PERIOD
What I should tell you -- what I should tell you is that they've each prepared their own little TED talks .PERIOD
Well you know ,COMMA she calls herself black -- she's really more like a caramel color if you look at her .PERIOD
Frankly ,COMMA I'm kvelling just to be here with all the luminaries you have attending something like this ,COMMA you know .PERIOD

Okay .PERIOD Sorry .PERIOD So anyway ,COMMA what I was trying to say is that I really love TED .PERIOD
Like ,COMMA it's -- I can't get over this right now .PERIOD

But that's where we had some problems .PERIOD
The daughter's marriage is very special to the mom .PERIOD
And I said ,COMMA Yes ,COMMA men can be difficult ,COMMA but all women have to get used to that .PERIOD
So ,COMMA I always teach my kids to respect American ideas ,COMMA but I told my daughter that this is one exception -- -- that she is not gay ,COMMA she is just confused by this American problem .PERIOD
Thank you very ,COMMA very much .PERIOD I love you .PERIOD
Finished university education ,COMMA got a medical degree ,COMMA 1986 .PERIOD
But ,COMMA critical poverty :COLON this slide is from a presentation I gave not that long ago .PERIOD Gapminderorg tells the story of the gap between Africa and the rest of the world in terms of health care .PERIOD
Yes ,COMMA I'm sorry if it upsets some of you ,COMMA but I think you need to see this .PERIOD That's the floor ,COMMA OK ?QUESTIONMARK
Because it's scary and it's expensive ,COMMA but we need to have it ,COMMA OK ?QUESTIONMARK
That's Mike ,COMMA Mike comes out from Mississippi .PERIOD
See ,COMMA that's one of the problems we have in Nigeria and in Africa generally .PERIOD
It looks like all these Americans are here and yes ,COMMA one Brit ,COMMA and he's not going to do anything -- he thinks he's British actually ,COMMA and he's actually Nigerian ,COMMA I just thought about that .PERIOD
We eventually got it working ,COMMA is the truth ,COMMA but it was one of these .PERIOD Even older than the one you saw .PERIOD
No ?QUESTIONMARK Yes ?QUESTIONMARK Doesn't matter ,COMMA it worked .PERIOD
And currently we're working on oxygen -- oxygen delivery on-site .PERIOD
So that's not new .PERIOD What we're doing is applying this technology to it .PERIOD
These are members of my graduating class ,COMMA 1986 .PERIOD
And finally ,COMMA I get a call last year ,COMMA and then I have to go up after JJ .PERIOD Abrams .PERIOD
Hollywood gathers around power tables ,COMMA and the Valley gathers around power tables .PERIOD
But I'm actually here today to tell a story .PERIOD
And what he said was ,COMMA he wasn't so much afraid that he might die ,COMMA but that he hadn't done the things that he wanted to with his life .PERIOD
But for me ,COMMA personally ,COMMA it was a real change .PERIOD
I went from living in a house with five guys in Palo Alto and living off their leftovers ,COMMA to all of a sudden having all kinds of resources .PERIOD
Connecting them together through conferences -- like a TED -- brings so many powerful connections ,COMMA or through the World Forum on Social Entrepreneurship that my foundation does at Oxford every year .PERIOD
So ,COMMA in 2003 ,COMMA I started to make my way around Los Angeles to talk about the idea of a pro-social media company and I was met with a lot of encouragement .PERIOD
One of the lines of encouragement that I heard over and over was ,COMMA The streets of Hollywood are littered with the carcasses of people like you ,COMMA who think you're going to come to this town and make movies .PERIOD
One of these films in particular ,COMMA called North Country ,COMMA was actually kind of a box office disaster .PERIOD
And that to me ,COMMA spoke volumes ,COMMA because it's -- the film started about a true-life story about a woman who was harassed ,COMMA sued her employer ,COMMA led to a landmark case that led to the Equal Opportunity Act ,COMMA and the Violence Against Women Act and others .PERIOD
At that point ,COMMA I thought I knew something about global warming .PERIOD
And we have 10 films in production right now ,COMMA and dozens others in development .PERIOD
And one thing that I've learned is that there's never one right way to make change .PERIOD
And I can imagine ,COMMA if we do this ,COMMA the headlines in 10 years might read something like these :COLON New AIDS Cases in Africa Fall to Zero ,COMMA US .PERIOD Imports its Last Barrel of Oil -- -- Israelis and Palestinians Celebrate 10 Years of Peaceful Coexistence .PERIOD
And I believe that ,COMMA working together ,COMMA we can make all of these things happen .PERIOD
The next day ,COMMA all the artists were invited to join Mandela in Robben Island ,COMMA where he was going to give a conference to the world's press ,COMMA standing in front of his former prison cell .PERIOD
He was wearing a t-shirt like the one I wear now .PERIOD
I've subsequently become an envoy for Scotland and HIV .PERIOD
I tell her story to everyone because she represents one of millions of HIV/AIDS orphans .PERIOD
I think that's fair to say ,COMMA it's almost everyone in the hall .PERIOD
But now we have this new layer of private sovereignty in cyberspace .PERIOD
And their decisions about software coding ,COMMA engineering ,COMMA design ,COMMA terms of service all act as a kind of law that shapes what we can and cannot do with our digital lives .PERIOD
The reality is that even in democratic societies today ,COMMA we do not have good answers for how you balance the need for security and law enforcement on one hand and protection of civil liberties and free speech on the other in our digital networks .PERIOD
This is a map of social networks worldwide ,COMMA and certainly Facebook has conquered much of the world -- which is either a good or a bad thing ,COMMA depending on how you like the way Facebook manages its service .PERIOD
In plain English ,COMMA that means censorship and surveillance of their users .PERIOD
This has a chilling effect on people's ability to use the Internet to hold government accountable .PERIOD
Thank you very much .PERIOD
Comparable ,COMMA in its own very peculiar way ,COMMA to the achievements of Microsoft or Google .PERIOD
Here are some of those same weightlifters after their 1989 makeover .PERIOD
And so I resolved to travel around the world examining this global criminal underworld by talking to policemen ,COMMA by talking to victims ,COMMA by talking to consumers of illicit goods and services .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA organized crime in a globalizing world operates in the same way as any other business .PERIOD
And it is this Western desire to consume that is the primary driver of international organized crime .PERIOD
And as a consequence of this trade ,COMMA Britain alone lost eight billion dollars in revenue .PERIOD
So what were these guys doing with all the money they were making ?QUESTIONMARK
Well ,COMMA this is where we come to globalization ,COMMA because that was not just the deregulation of global trade .PERIOD
This one ,COMMA however ,COMMA is in central British Columbia where I photographed it .PERIOD
What they've done is they've shifted their operations .PERIOD
People don't smoke as much dope ,COMMA or visit prostitutes quite so frequently during a recession .PERIOD
And so as soon as I saw this drop into my inbox ,COMMA I dispatched it hastily to the recycle bin and spared myself a very nasty infection .PERIOD
It's such a large conference .PERIOD
Mark Serfaas .PERIOD It's pretty cool ,COMMA huh ?QUESTIONMARK Pursuing happiness .PERIOD
I mean -- no ,COMMA I mean like in the TED sense ?QUESTIONMARK
1860 -- am I good ?QUESTIONMARK
and my name ,COMMA and it would tell me .PERIOD And I have to tell you ,COMMA right now ,COMMA this is an unadulterated piece of software ,COMMA this is a real Internet browser and this is an actual Google site ,COMMA and we're going to test it out live today .PERIOD
Am I feeling lucky ?QUESTIONMARK
Ze Frank :COLON Oh .PERIOD Amazing .PERIOD
Needless to say ,COMMA I was able to leave my job .PERIOD
Four years later ,COMMA I still get probably two or three hundred emails a day from people I don't know ,COMMA and it's been an amazing opportunity to kind of get to know different cultures ,COMMA you know ?QUESTIONMARK
And that was embarrassing .PERIOD
So ,COMMA the Scribbler is an attempt to create a generative tool .PERIOD
I mean this is incredible .PERIOD This is an 11 -year-old girl -- drew this and submitted it .PERIOD It's just gorgeous .PERIOD
None of the haikus were written by the same person ,COMMA and in fact ,COMMA no line was -- you know ,COMMA each line is contributed by a different person at a different -- at a different time .PERIOD
It dances to music .PERIOD Lotte Reiniger ,COMMA an amazing shadow puppeteer in the ' 20 s ,COMMA that started doing more elaborate things .PERIOD
Chris Anderson :COLON Ladies and gentlemen ,COMMA Mr .PERIOD Ze Frank .PERIOD
Well ,COMMA this is 2009 .PERIOD
So I'm going to talk about it .PERIOD
We get the geneticists keeping on telling us how extremely closely we are related -- hardly any genes of difference ,COMMA very ,COMMA very closely related .PERIOD
I'm not talking about airy-fairy stuff about culture or psychology ,COMMA or behavior .PERIOD
Professor Tobias came over from South Africa and spoke to University College London .PERIOD
You've believed it through generations .PERIOD
So that is what they have done now .PERIOD
Aaron Filler from Harvard said ,COMMA Isn't it time we stopped talking about selective pressures ?QUESTIONMARK
He kept it to himself for 30 years .PERIOD
And at that time ,COMMA it became set in stone :COLON the aquatic theory should be dumped with the UFOs and the yetis ,COMMA as part of the lunatic fringe of science .PERIOD
I suggested it and people said ,COMMA No no no .PERIOD
Peals of merry laughter !EXCLAMATIONMARK
That crazy woman .PERIOD She's off again .PERIOD She'll say anything won't she ?QUESTIONMARK
This has come 'round to be that all those naked pachyderms have aquatic ancestors .PERIOD
So this is a close connection between nakedness and water .PERIOD
Here you can't find anybody to compare it with ,COMMA because we're the only animal that walks upright on two legs .PERIOD
There is only one circumstance in which they always ,COMMA all of them ,COMMA walk on two legs ,COMMA and that is when they are wading through water .PERIOD
David Attenborough thinks it's significant ,COMMA as the possible beginning of our bipedalism .PERIOD
In the whale it's complete :COLON no fat inside at all ,COMMA all in blubber outside .PERIOD
We can speak .PERIOD
Try to imagine a gorilla performing the same maneuver ,COMMA and you can see that ,COMMA compared with gorilla ,COMMA we are halfway to being shaped like a fish .PERIOD
There is nothing there .PERIOD
I don't believe it .PERIOD
There was Professor Tobias .PERIOD He's come over .PERIOD
Daniel Dennett ,COMMA he's come over .PERIOD
So the third thing that might happen is a very beautiful thing .PERIOD
I can tell you that in three words .PERIOD
The textbooks don't mention it .PERIOD
And it's pretty simple .PERIOD
Everybody's got one -- all of you .PERIOD
And so when working as an interaction designer ,COMMA or as an artist who deals with participation -- creating things that live on ,COMMA in or around the human form -- it's really a powerful space to work within .PERIOD
And it is a tool that actually enables one to listen to their own innards .PERIOD
When I meet a glacier for the very first time ,COMMA what do I do ?QUESTIONMARK
Do I carve a message in the snow ?QUESTIONMARK
But really the most satisfying experience I've had is the act of listening ,COMMA which is what we need in any good relationship .PERIOD
And just as with the wall ,COMMA how I wanted to be more wall-like ,COMMA with this project ,COMMA I'd actually like to take more a of glacial pace .PERIOD
So ,COMMA how do you do that ?QUESTIONMARK
That doesn't move .PERIOD
Here's my promise to you :COLON If you are consistent and do this ,COMMA within three months the elected official will start calling you when that issue comes up and say ,COMMA What do you think ?QUESTIONMARK
Now ,COMMA when you approach these animals ,COMMA you need to understand there's a dangerous end to them ,COMMA and you also need to approach them with some level of respect and a little bit of wariness .PERIOD
If you had the right information ,COMMA you would have done the right thing .PERIOD
If they follow protocol ,COMMA they'll pick up the phone and say ,COMMA Hey ,COMMA do you have the original ?QUESTIONMARK
And you actually get into the folder that the elected official actually has to read .PERIOD
So ,COMMA what your letter means :COLON I've got to tell you ,COMMA we are all in a party ,COMMA and political officials are the pinatas .PERIOD
Living systems are in constant conversation with the natural world ,COMMA through sets of chemical reactions called metabolism .PERIOD
And this is the conversion of one group of substances into another ,COMMA either through the production or the absorption of energy .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA that's exactly the kind of process that I'm interested in ,COMMA when we're thinking about sustainable materials .PERIOD
It is able to move around its environment .PERIOD
It can follow chemical gradients .PERIOD
It can undergo complex reactions ,COMMA some of which are happily architectural .PERIOD
Here ,COMMA this is a protocell ,COMMA and it's vigorously shedding this skin .PERIOD
The protocells can actually move away from the light .PERIOD
So ,COMMA this is really interesting .PERIOD Now we have an architecture that connects a city to the natural world in a very direct and immediate way .PERIOD
This is a river .PERIOD
The reasons vary state to state ,COMMA but mostly in the details .PERIOD
But as more people showed up wanting water ,COMMA the folks who were there first got a little concerned ,COMMA and in 1865 ,COMMA Montana passed its first water law .PERIOD
There's another thing happening around the country ,COMMA which is that companies are starting to get concerned about their water footprint .PERIOD
So what can they do about this remaining water footprint that can have serious effects on the ecosystem ?QUESTIONMARK
He doesn't lose the water right ,COMMA he just chooses to apply that right ,COMMA or some portion of it ,COMMA to the stream ,COMMA instead of to the land .PERIOD
This guy's measuring the water that this leaves in the stream .PERIOD
He's by far the happiest man ever measured by science .PERIOD
Compassion is fun .PERIOD
Therefore ,COMMA to create the conditions for global compassion ,COMMA all we have to do is to reframe compassion as something that is fun .PERIOD
These are leaders who are highly ambitious for the greater good .PERIOD
And they ,COMMA according to the research ,COMMA make the best business leaders .PERIOD
And if you look at these qualities in the context of compassion ,COMMA we find that the cognitive and affective components of compassion -- understanding people and empathizing with people -- inhibits ,COMMA tones down ,COMMA what I call the excessive self-obsession that's in us ,COMMA therefore creating the conditions for humility .PERIOD
This awareness of serving the greater good is very self-inspiring and it creates fertile ground for compassion to grow in .PERIOD
That's one .PERIOD
The second ingredient is autonomy .PERIOD
And this also creates the conditions for compassion in the workplace .PERIOD
I found this to be true ,COMMA both on the individual level and at a corporate level .PERIOD
And what I recognized was that there was an incredible window of opportunity for us as a world community to come together and end torture as an investigative tool .PERIOD
We often think of torture as being political torture or reserved for just the worst ,COMMA but ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA 95 percent of torture today is not for political prisoners .PERIOD
So it's just a place where there was no rule of law .PERIOD
In Burundi I walked into a prison and it wasn't a 12 -year-old boy ,COMMA it was an 8 -year-old boy for stealing a mobile phone .PERIOD
And when I walked up to the prison director ,COMMA I said ,COMMA You've got to let her out .PERIOD
So the pieces are ,COMMA not only the training of the lawyers ,COMMA but us finding a way to systematically implement early access to counsel ,COMMA because they are the safeguard in the system for people who are being tortured .PERIOD
But the third and most important thing is that we make a commitment to this .PERIOD
And the reason that I think that those words are interesting is because those were the same kinds of words that were used for people who decided they would end slavery ,COMMA or end apartheid .PERIOD
So ,COMMA you know ,COMMA there's bars .PERIOD And by the time that Vishna was getting bigger ,COMMA which means what gets bigger ?QUESTIONMARK Your head gets bigger .PERIOD
So he would come to the first bar ,COMMA the second bar and then the third bar ,COMMA and then really slowly move his head so he could fit through ,COMMA and come back ,COMMA third ,COMMA second ,COMMA first .PERIOD And he would grab my pinkie ,COMMA because what he wanted to do every day is he wanted to go visit .PERIOD
And I will do the one thing that I can do .PERIOD
Thank you .PERIOD
We were in Queens ,COMMA we were building the big ,COMMA big ,COMMA big ,COMMA big building in Midtown ,COMMA so we were in the small ,COMMA small ,COMMA small boondocks .PERIOD
But it's not only that .PERIOD
In Italy ,COMMA in Milan especially ,COMMA contemporary art really doesn't have that much of a place .PERIOD
They tried to make a toddler's gas mask in such a way that the toddler can be held by the parent because proximity of the body is so important .PERIOD
Instead ,COMMA she said ,COMMA No ,COMMA no .PERIOD Work and leisure can be together .PERIOD
Yeah ,COMMA that's particularly gorgeous -- it's the TV dinner of 2001 .PERIOD
I would like ,COMMA instead ,COMMA to talk about how great some designers are .PERIOD
It's a long story because it started before 2001 and it was called Emergency .PERIOD
So ,COMMA designers sometimes don't do things that are immediately functional ,COMMA but they're functional to our understanding of issues .PERIOD
This is Cindy van den Bremen ,COMMA who is a Dutch designer that's done this series of Capsters .PERIOD
They range from this fluffy toy that is about hugging you -- because autistic children like to be hugged tight ,COMMA so it has a spring inside -- all the way to this doll with a mirror so the child can see him or herself in the mirror and regain a sense of self .PERIOD
Design really looks upon the whole world and it considers the world in all of its different ranges .PERIOD
And it was really interesting because I was the last speaker and before me there were people that were really talking about luxury ,COMMA and I didn't want to be a party pooper but at the same time I felt that I had to kind of bring back the discourse to reality .PERIOD
The rhythm of the sinusoids has changed tremendously ,COMMA just like the rhythm of our life in the past 25 years ,COMMA so I'm not sure anymore what the wavelength is .PERIOD
But design and science and the possibility of visualizing different scales ,COMMA and therefore ,COMMA really work at the scale of the very small to make it very big and very meaningful .PERIOD
So ,COMMA Africa is a complex continent full of contradictions ,COMMA as you can see .PERIOD
And I want to tell you that this is my story ,COMMA OK ?QUESTIONMARK
And it's the story of many of the Africans who are here .PERIOD
And my father said ,COMMA OK ,COMMA listen .PERIOD
So we went to the school ,COMMA and because we were nobodies ,COMMA and because we didn't have privilege ,COMMA and because my father didn't have the right last name ,COMMA he was treated like dirt .PERIOD
But the money ran out .PERIOD
You don't see the blogger ,COMMA you don't see the Harvard-educated lawyer ,COMMA the vibrant person ,COMMA you know ?QUESTIONMARK
And you didn't know about the windmill ,COMMA you know ?QUESTIONMARK
And I was just moved .PERIOD
So ,COMMA what is to be done ?QUESTIONMARK
And this is an example ,COMMA you know ,COMMA blogging is one way of doing that .PERIOD
So we need to start getting better .PERIOD
And going back to the point I was trying to make ,COMMA this is the Swahili Wikipedia .PERIOD
Swahili is spoken by about 50 million people in East Africa .PERIOD
So ,COMMA that's a start ,COMMA and we've heard of all their other initiatives .PERIOD
I walked away from a job with one of the top firms in DC ,COMMA Covington and Burling ,COMMA six figures .PERIOD
What are they doing ?QUESTIONMARK
Practically .PERIOD I mean ,COMMA when I was a first-year student in law school ,COMMA my mom's business had collapsed ,COMMA so I was supporting her .PERIOD
My sister was struggling to get through undergrad .PERIOD
An example .PERIOD This man changed my life .PERIOD
I said ,COMMA I want to be a lawyer .PERIOD
And I'm like ,COMMA Because I'm here and it's cheap ,COMMA and you know ,COMMA I kind of like Pittsburgh .PERIOD
I was also building something called the Copenhagen Wheel ,COMMA which is just a really beautiful ,COMMA beautiful electric bike at a lab at MIT called SENSEable City Lab .PERIOD
This is a place where my friend ,COMMA Abhishek Sen was interning .PERIOD
And that's his actual photograph .PERIOD
She told me that this is how you would typically test for anemia .PERIOD
But this is not available in Parol .PERIOD
But fundamentally ,COMMA what I believe is that the map behind of me is called basically the map of anemia .PERIOD
And when I walked in ,COMMA she was already at the table .PERIOD
And she said ,COMMA I saw your Talk live-streamed .PERIOD
So of course ,COMMA the only thing I could think of to say at that point was ,COMMA Yeah ,COMMA me neither .PERIOD
Why did you bring this up ?QUESTIONMARK Have you lost your mind ?QUESTIONMARK
And I said ,COMMA I'm just thinking about it a little bit .PERIOD
And my life did end when that happened .PERIOD
The first is vulnerability is not weakness .PERIOD
The majority of people .PERIOD
I define vulnerability as emotional risk ,COMMA exposure ,COMMA uncertainty .PERIOD
I am not a natural vulnerability researcher .PERIOD
So when I became Vulnerability TED ,COMMA like an action figure -- like Ninja Barbie ,COMMA but I'm Vulnerability TED -- I thought ,COMMA I'm going to leave that shame stuff behind ,COMMA because I spent six years studying shame before I really started writing and talking about vulnerability .PERIOD
But in surviving this last year ,COMMA I was reminded of a cardinal rule -- not a research rule ,COMMA but a moral imperative from my upbringing -- you've got to dance with the one who brung ya .PERIOD
It is to put on some galoshes and walk through and find our way around .PERIOD
Here's why .PERIOD
I can't wait to tell people this .PERIOD
The credit goes to the man in the arena whose face is marred with dust and blood and sweat .PERIOD
That's what life is about ,COMMA about daring greatly ,COMMA about being in the arena .PERIOD
I know your dad never paid attention ,COMMA even when you made CFO .PERIOD
Shame drives two big tapes -- never good enough and ,COMMA if you can talk it out of that one ,COMMA who do you think you are ?QUESTIONMARK
It's uncomfortable ,COMMA but it's adaptive .PERIOD
I did not interview men for the first four years of my study .PERIOD
And he said ,COMMA That's convenient .PERIOD
So I started interviewing men and asking questions .PERIOD
If you put shame in a Petri dish ,COMMA it needs three things to grow exponentially :COLON secrecy ,COMMA silence and judgment .PERIOD
If you put the same amount of shame in a Petri dish and douse it with empathy ,COMMA it can't survive .PERIOD
And I know it's seductive to stand outside the arena ,COMMA because I think I did it my whole life ,COMMA and think to myself ,COMMA I'm going to go in there and kick some ass when I'm bulletproof and when I'm perfect .PERIOD
We want you to go in .PERIOD
So what would be better [than] to use the Herring Gull ,COMMA in its freedom ,COMMA circling and swooping over the sea ,COMMA and [to] use this as a role model ?QUESTIONMARK
So maybe we'll try it once -- to fly a SmartBird .PERIOD
We have to turn it ,COMMA go up and go down .PERIOD
Bruno Giussani :COLON Markus ,COMMA I think that we should fly it once more .PERIOD
I think first it's important for us to recognize what it is to be blind .PERIOD
Today ,COMMA we're reaching not even 10 percent of them .PERIOD
He had to mortgage all his life savings to make a bank loan .PERIOD
It is ourselves we are healing .PERIOD
This helped us build a very ethical and very highly patient-centric organization and systems that support it .PERIOD
So what is in this video is a surgeon operating ,COMMA and then you see on the other side ,COMMA another patient is getting ready .PERIOD
And ,COMMA of course ,COMMA one needs the mindset to be wanting to give away what you have as a surplus .PERIOD
And what we did was a couple of very counter-intuitive things .PERIOD
And then ,COMMA over time ,COMMA we were able to bring down the cost significantly to about two percent of what it used to be when we started out .PERIOD
So we're really comparing apples to apples .PERIOD
So I want to end my talk leaving this thought and challenge to you .PERIOD
Dr .PERIOD V :COLON When you grow in spiritual consciousness ,COMMA we identify with all that is in the world so there is no exploitation .PERIOD
So the question is :COLON how do we get the stuff over from the digital into the physical ?QUESTIONMARK
Let me show you the weight-shifting mobile .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA mass is the first thing ;SEMICOLON the second thing ,COMMA that's shape .PERIOD
Again ,COMMA it's a mobile phone-shaped box ,COMMA and this one can change its shape .PERIOD
As humans ,COMMA we are social ,COMMA we are empathic ,COMMA and that's great .PERIOD
So ,COMMA that's very intuitive ,COMMA and that's what we want .PERIOD
The Brown administration ,COMMA and a bunch of my friends ,COMMA basically leveled the energy efficiency of California ,COMMA so it's the same now ,COMMA 30 years later ,COMMA even though our economy has gone up 80 percent ,COMMA per capita .PERIOD
The dominant demographic event of our time is this screamingly rapid urbanization that we have going on .PERIOD
It's interesting ,COMMA because history is driven to a large degree by the size of cities .PERIOD
People are following opportunity into town .PERIOD
It is not the case that slums undermine prosperity ,COMMA not the working slums ;SEMICOLON they help create prosperity .PERIOD
These people are valuable as a group .PERIOD
You look at that lane on the right .PERIOD
They're doing it through an outlaw thing ,COMMA the informal economy .PERIOD
And young people in brand new cities they're inventing ,COMMA doing new things ,COMMA in the south .PERIOD
Climate is a profoundly complex ,COMMA nonlinear system ,COMMA full of runaway positive feedbacks ,COMMA hidden thresholds and irrevocable tipping points .PERIOD
We're going to keep being surprised .PERIOD And almost all the surprises are going to be bad ones .PERIOD
If all of the electricity you used in your lifetime was nuclear ,COMMA the amount of waste that would be added up would fit in a Coke can .PERIOD
It's interesting ,COMMA say ,COMMA to take a 25 -megawatt ,COMMA 25 million watts ,COMMA and you compare it to the standard big iron of an ordinary Westinghouse or Ariva ,COMMA which is 12 ,COMMA 16 billion watts .PERIOD
These things are way smaller .PERIOD They're much more adaptable .PERIOD
This is a list of them .PERIOD
And as those events keep happening we're going to say ,COMMA Okay ,COMMA what can we do about that really ?QUESTIONMARK
Here is an example that climatologists like a lot ,COMMA one of the dozens of geoengineering ideas .PERIOD
Now this shouldn't come as a surprise to us .PERIOD
As with BP ,COMMA the hole does get plugged ,COMMA at least temporarily ,COMMA but not before exacting a tremendous price .PERIOD
Now both of these options -- the boy genius and the scammer -- are going to make you vastly overconfident and therefore more prone to taking even bigger risks in the future .PERIOD
The Gulf of Mexico is a very big ocean .PERIOD
In other words ,COMMA the ocean is big ;SEMICOLON she can take it .PERIOD
A new bubble will replace the old one .PERIOD
Now looking at these images ,COMMA it's difficult to grasp the scale of this operation ,COMMA which can already be seen from space and could grow to an area the size of England .PERIOD
An escape hatch has been reached .PERIOD
OK .PERIOD DH :COLON Oh !EXCLAMATIONMARK All right .PERIOD
I'm now pushing my luck :COLON I'm skipping right to six cups .PERIOD

Merci beaucoup .PERIOD I love you .PERIOD
Well we have a whole OR .PERIOD team ,COMMA general anesthesia ,COMMA nurses ,COMMA and another doctor across from me .PERIOD
There will be two passes here ,COMMA in the same patient ,COMMA from the same hole .PERIOD
This was done under local anesthesia ,COMMA as an outpatient .PERIOD
In the last decade there's been an explosion of use of bone marrow stem cells to treat the patient's other diseases such as heart disease ,COMMA vascular disease ,COMMA orthopedics ,COMMA tissue engineering ,COMMA even in neurology to treat Parkinson's and diabetes .PERIOD
We've just come out ,COMMA we're commercializing ,COMMA this year ,COMMA generation 20 of the Marrow Miner .PERIOD
That was all done on a machine that looks like this .PERIOD
So now what we do is we take a genome ,COMMA we make maybe 50 copies of it ,COMMA we cut all those copies up into little 50 -base reads ,COMMA and then we sequence them ,COMMA massively parallel .PERIOD
And he sequenced ,COMMA he took skin cells ,COMMA healthy skin ,COMMA and cancerous bone marrow ,COMMA and he sequenced the whole genomes of both of them in a couple of weeks ,COMMA no big deal .PERIOD
And so they were given L-Dopa ,COMMA and their symptoms did improve ,COMMA but they weren't totally asymptomatic .PERIOD
And so what he did was he got his kids sequenced .PERIOD
Thankfully ,COMMA I was able to answer A ,COMMA and I say that honestly in case my life insurance agent is listening .PERIOD
Not hard to imagine .PERIOD My company has software that does this right now .PERIOD
It can be summed up in a single sentence :COLON Everything that can happen ,COMMA does .PERIOD
And things can happen only if these interactions are perfectly balanced .PERIOD
All of these matter particles come in left- and right-handed varieties ,COMMA and have anti-particle partners that carry opposite charges .PERIOD
These matter particles all interact with the various force particles .PERIOD
The most important thing to understand here is that there's a different kind of charge associated with each of these forces .PERIOD
A particle that hasn't been seen yet ,COMMA but we're pretty sure exists ,COMMA is the Higgs particle ,COMMA which gives masses to all these other particles .PERIOD
And it seems strange that nature would have so many elementary particles .PERIOD
The most familiar charge is electric charge .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA it turns out the electric charge is actually a combination of two other charges :COLON hypercharge and weak charge .PERIOD
For example ,COMMA this weak force particle and its anti-particle can be created in a collision .PERIOD
One of the weak particles could decay into an electron and an anti-neutrino ,COMMA and these three still add to zero total charge .PERIOD
So there's an old idea in particle physics that this known pattern of charges ,COMMA which is not very symmetric ,COMMA could emerge from a more perfect pattern that gets broken -- similar to how the Higgs particle breaks the electroweak pattern to give electromagnetism .PERIOD
This particular choice corresponds to a grand unified theory introduced by Pati and Salam in 1973 .PERIOD
The larger pattern allows us to predict the existence of particles that have never been seen .PERIOD
These particles are not uniquely identified by their six charges .PERIOD
Each point in this pattern corresponds to a symmetry of this very complex and beautiful shape .PERIOD
And this idea that nature is described by mathematics is not at all new .PERIOD
In 1623 ,COMMA Galileo wrote this :COLON Nature's grand book ,COMMA which stands continually open to our gaze ,COMMA is written in the language of mathematics .PERIOD
And ,COMMA of course ,COMMA bad for me personally .PERIOD
In this regard ,COMMA new physics theories are a lot like start-up companies .PERIOD
As with any large investment ,COMMA it can be emotionally difficult to abandon a line of research when it isn't working out .PERIOD
I try to balance my life equally between physics ,COMMA love and surfing -- my own three charge directions .PERIOD
And that shape has remarkable similarities -- and the way it fits into this E 8 pattern could be the rest of the picture .PERIOD
They are more like us than any other living creature ,COMMA and we've heard about that during this TED Conference .PERIOD
Chimpanzees ,COMMA I believe ,COMMA more than any other living creature ,COMMA have helped us to understand that ,COMMA after all ,COMMA there is no sharp line between humans and the rest of the animal kingdom .PERIOD
There isn't time to go into it ,COMMA but it's including things like tree nurseries ,COMMA methods of farming most suitable to this now very degraded ,COMMA almost desert-like land up in these mountains .PERIOD
Ways of reclaiming overused farmland ,COMMA so that within two years they can again be productive .PERIOD
Perhaps build some schoolrooms .PERIOD
And we've got ,COMMA as is the case around the world ,COMMA about 95 percent of all loans returned .PERIOD
And as a result of this program ,COMMA something's happening for conservation .PERIOD
What's happening for conservation is that the farmers living in these 24 villages ,COMMA instead of looking on us as a bunch of white people coming to study a whole bunch of monkeys -- and by the way ,COMMA many of the staff are now Tanzanian -- but when we began the TACARE program ,COMMA it was a Tanzanian team going into the villages .PERIOD
And everywhere there were these terrible problems .PERIOD
And you know the kind I'm talking about .PERIOD I'm talking about pollution .PERIOD
The water -- water is perhaps one of the most crucial issues that we're going to face in this century -- and everywhere water is being polluted by agricultural ,COMMA industrial and household chemicals that still are being sprayed around the world ,COMMA seemingly with the inability to profit from past experience .PERIOD
In many parts of sub-Saharan Africa ,COMMA the droughts are so much worse .PERIOD
Well ,COMMA do you think there could be some kind of disconnect between this extraordinarily clever brain ,COMMA the kind of brain that the TED technologies exemplify ,COMMA and the human heart ?QUESTIONMARK Talking about it in the non-scientific term ,COMMA in terms of love and compassion .PERIOD Is there some disconnect ?QUESTIONMARK
We have compromised their future .PERIOD
Hundreds and thousands of young people around the world can break through and can make this a better world for all living things .PERIOD
One of their projects will be to help animals -- not just wildlife ,COMMA domestic animals as well .PERIOD
You can't come to a conference like TED and not have hope ,COMMA can you ?QUESTIONMARK
And I mean ,COMMA think of the technologies .PERIOD
How many of us have children or grandchildren ,COMMA nieces ,COMMA nephews ?QUESTIONMARK
People like this are so inspirational .PERIOD
And I hope that some of us can get together and talk about some of these things ,COMMA especially the Roots and Shoots program .PERIOD
And it was very ,COMMA very exciting for me to meet her and see just one example of how young people ,COMMA when they are empowered ,COMMA given the opportunity to take action ,COMMA to make the world a better place ,COMMA truly are our hope for tomorrow .PERIOD
But other than letting some of you live out your fantasy of looking as cool as Tom Cruise in Minority Report ,COMMA the reason why we're really excited about this device is that it really can act as one of these sixth-sense devices that gives you relevant information about whatever is in front of you .PERIOD
You can get video annotations of the event that you're reading about You can get the latest sports scores etc .PERIOD
I then ,COMMA in the last few years ,COMMA learned about the Pacific garbage patch and the gyre .PERIOD
And the bigger picture is :COLON we need to find a way to turn off the faucet .PERIOD
It's not just that gyre of plastic that I'm concerned about -- it's the gyre of plastic in the supermarket .PERIOD
You put something in a bin and you don't have to think about it again .PERIOD
And I'm sure you'll feel that it's from a safe source .PERIOD
But what if it wasn't ?QUESTIONMARK
The smallest bacteria is about 200 nanometers .PERIOD
But I got to thinking ,COMMA you know ,COMMA if we were in the middle of a flood zone in Bangladesh ,COMMA the water wouldn't look like this .PERIOD
There we go .PERIOD Mind the electrics .PERIOD
Pop the cartridge out .PERIOD Pop a new one in .PERIOD
About half a cent a day to run .PERIOD
To put that into context ,COMMA The UK .PERIOD government spends about 12 billion pounds a year on foreign aid .PERIOD
Phyllis Rodriguez :COLON We are here today because of the fact that we have what most people consider an unusual friendship .PERIOD
And yet ,COMMA it feels natural to us now .PERIOD
And when I saw it -- and yet ,COMMA through the shock ,COMMA the terrible shock ,COMMA and the terrible explosion in our lives ,COMMA literally ,COMMA we were not vengeful .PERIOD
I am the mother of Zacarias Moussaoui .PERIOD
My son ,COMMA I don't know where he is .PERIOD
So that's why I decided to tell my story ,COMMA so that my suffering is something positive for other women .PERIOD
We must be hand-in-hand and do something together .PERIOD
So if I can save one of the young girls ,COMMA and avoid that they get married and suffer as much as I did ,COMMA well this is something good .PERIOD
I would like to say that I have learned so much from Aicha ,COMMA starting with that day we had our very first meeting with other family members -- which was a very private meeting with security ,COMMA because it was November 2002 ,COMMA and ,COMMA frankly ,COMMA we were afraid of the super-patriotism of that time in the country -- those of us family members .PERIOD
Why did we want to meet her ?QUESTIONMARK
And what happened then is we all told our stories ,COMMA and we all connected as human beings .PERIOD
I never had met someone with such a hard life ,COMMA from such a totally different culture and environment from my own .PERIOD
And these are always periods ,COMMA ladies and gentlemen ,COMMA accompanied by turbulence ,COMMA and all too often by blood .PERIOD
For power is not just moving laterally from nation to nation .PERIOD
It's also moving vertically .PERIOD
My guess is ,COMMA for what it's worth ,COMMA is that the United States will remain the most powerful nation on earth for the next 10 years ,COMMA 15 ,COMMA but the context in which she holds her power has now radically altered ;SEMICOLON it has radically changed .PERIOD
But that's not a usual case in history .PERIOD
A fixed polarity of power means fixed alliances .PERIOD
Canning ,COMMA the great British foreign secretary once said ,COMMA Britain has a common interest ,COMMA but no common allies .PERIOD
At that time ,COMMA the defense of my country was about one thing and one thing only :COLON how strong was our army ,COMMA how strong was our air force ,COMMA how strong was our navy and how strong were our allies .PERIOD
But now one final thing .PERIOD
Collective security is not enough .PERIOD
Peace has come to Northern Ireland because both sides realized that the zero-sum game couldn't work .PERIOD
And so suddenly ,COMMA ladies and gentlemen ,COMMA what has been the proposition of visionaries and poets down the ages becomes something we have to take seriously as a matter of public policy .PERIOD
I started with a poem ,COMMA I'll end with one .PERIOD
For John Donne ,COMMA a recommendation of morality .PERIOD
But if you ask the average American what the optimal formula of longevity is ,COMMA they probably couldn't tell you .PERIOD
You have the USDA food pyramid .PERIOD
False .PERIOD
It reminds me of my college days .PERIOD
So to make it to age 100 ,COMMA you not only have to have had a very good lifestyle ,COMMA you also have to have won the genetic lottery .PERIOD
That's why a 65 -year-old person is aging at a rate of about 125 times faster than a 12 -year-old person .PERIOD
And research shows that they would be years largely free of chronic disease ,COMMA heart disease ,COMMA cancer and diabetes .PERIOD
But the real secret I think lies more in the way that they organize their society .PERIOD
Just look at the advertisements .PERIOD
One fifth the rate of colon and breast cancer ,COMMA big killers here in America .PERIOD
We're down to one and half right now .PERIOD
This particular Moai ,COMMA these five ladies have been together for 97 years .PERIOD
And then one day ,COMMA boom ,COMMA we retire .PERIOD
But they influence each other in profound and measurable ways .PERIOD
They don't have any conveniences .PERIOD
That burns calories just as much as going on the treadmill does .PERIOD
They know how to set up their life in the right way so they have the right outlook .PERIOD
You know the two most dangerous years in your life are the year you're born ,COMMA because of infant mortality ,COMMA and the year you retire .PERIOD
And they have strategies to keep from overeating ,COMMA little things that nudge them away from the table at the right time .PERIOD
And then the foundation of all this is how they connect .PERIOD
Diets don't work .PERIOD No diet in the history of the world has ever worked for more than two percent of the population .PERIOD
So when I had the chance to give the world's expert in gravity the experience of zero gravity ,COMMA it was incredible .PERIOD
You can get eight ,COMMA 10 minutes of weightlessness -- how NASA's trained their astronauts for so long .PERIOD
And you can actually roll some of the pictures now ,COMMA because I don't want to look at me on the screen .PERIOD
It's almost like that old recipe for chicken soup where you boil the chicken until the flavor is just gone .PERIOD
These micro-machines ,COMMA which are the envy of nanotechnologists the world over ,COMMA are self-directed ,COMMA powerful ,COMMA precise ,COMMA accurate devices that are made out of strings of amino acids .PERIOD
And so what I'm going to show you is a three-minute Reader's Digest version of the first aspect of this film that we produced .PERIOD It's an ongoing project that's going to go another four or five years .PERIOD
And each of us has about 100000 of these things running around ,COMMA right now ,COMMA inside each one of your 100 trillion cells .PERIOD
So no matter how lazy you feel ,COMMA you're not really intrinsically doing nothing .PERIOD
And three years ago ,COMMA one of the things I learned how to do was to become invisible .PERIOD
I didn't always succeed .PERIOD
A friend told me ,COMMA shortly after that ,COMMA that she had heard that Tim Russert ,COMMA a nationally renowned journalist ,COMMA had been talking about me on national TV .PERIOD
In my country ,COMMA that was the case in 1974 .PERIOD
The women said ,COMMA We agree .PERIOD We'll use pills ,COMMA but we need a doctor to prescribe the pills ,COMMA and we had very ,COMMA very few doctors .PERIOD
Wherever there were people -- and you can see boats with the women ,COMMA selling things -- here's the floating market selling bananas and crabs and also contraceptives -- wherever you find people ,COMMA you'll find contraceptives in Thailand .PERIOD
We introduced our first microcredit program in 1975 ,COMMA and the women who organized it said ,COMMA We only want to lend to women who practice family planning .PERIOD
It's a part of the Village Development Bank ;SEMICOLON it's not a real bank ,COMMA but it's a fund -- microcredit .PERIOD
And then we thought we'd help America ,COMMA because America's been helping everyone ,COMMA whether they want help or not .PERIOD
I said ,COMMA Don't worry .PERIOD Come over and I'll do the whole lot of you .PERIOD
And what happened ?QUESTIONMARK
Then AIDS came along and hit Thailand ,COMMA and we had to stop doing a lot of good things to fight AIDS .PERIOD
But unfortunately ,COMMA the government was in denial ,COMMA denial ,COMMA denial .PERIOD
And he said ,COMMA Mechai ,COMMA could you come and join ?QUESTIONMARK
He became the chairman of the National AIDS Committee and increased the budget fifty-fold .PERIOD
And then we gave condoms out everywhere on the streets -- everywhere ,COMMA everywhere .PERIOD
And then this is the picture I mentioned to you -- the weapon of mass protection .PERIOD
We all need to help .PERIOD
And before you can borrow the money ,COMMA you need to be trained .PERIOD
Otherwise they'll never get out of poverty .PERIOD
And it's a center ,COMMA a focal point for economic and social development .PERIOD
So we have now found the weapon of mass protection .PERIOD
In the last 20 years I have published a few books ,COMMA but I have lived in anonymity until February of 2006 ,COMMA when I carried the Olympic flag in the Winter Olympics in Italy .PERIOD
That made me a celebrity .PERIOD Now people recognize me in Macy's ,COMMA and my grandchildren think that I'm cool .PERIOD
My measurements .PERIOD
Those athletes had sacrificed everything to compete in the games .PERIOD
When asked in a TV interview ,COMMA How could she look so good ?QUESTIONMARK
Sophia Loren was right in front of me -- she's a foot taller than I am ,COMMA not counting the poofy hair .PERIOD
Somehow she manages to keep her seven children alive ,COMMA and a few months later ,COMMA she gives birth to premature twins .PERIOD
Somehow ,COMMA the family survives for 16 months ,COMMA and then ,COMMA by extraordinary luck ,COMMA and the passionate heart of a young American man ,COMMA Sasha Chanoff ,COMMA who manages to put her in a US .PERIOD rescue plane ,COMMA Rose Mapendo and her nine children end up in Phoenix ,COMMA Arizona ,COMMA where they're now living and thriving .PERIOD
Once ,COMMA when my daughter Paula was in her twenties ,COMMA she said to me that feminism was dated ,COMMA that I should move on .PERIOD
Yes ,COMMA for privileged women like my daughter and all of us here today ,COMMA but not for most of our sisters in the rest of the world who are still forced into premature marriage ,COMMA prostitution ,COMMA forced labor -- they have children that they don't want or they cannot feed .PERIOD
The place is a small women's clinic in a village in Bangladesh .PERIOD
She's not licensed for that ;SEMICOLON she has never done it .PERIOD
The woman's face looks like a watermelon .PERIOD
It is so swollen that you can't even see the eyes .PERIOD
Jenny is horrified at what she has done ,COMMA but then the translator explains that the patient's condition has nothing to do with the operation .PERIOD
They are paid less than men for the same work if they're paid at all ,COMMA and they remain vulnerable because they have no economic independence ,COMMA and they are constantly threatened by exploitation ,COMMA violence and abuse .PERIOD
In any war today ,COMMA most of the casualties are civilians ,COMMA mainly women and children .PERIOD They are collateral damage .PERIOD
I'm talking about men with young minds ,COMMA of course .PERIOD
Six billion hungry carnivores to feed ,COMMA by 2050 .PERIOD
And when you think that 80 percent of global trade in food now is controlled by just five multinational corporations ,COMMA it's a grim picture .PERIOD
So the grain markets were to the south of the city .PERIOD
But also you have to imagine it full of food .PERIOD
And if we look at an image of Smithfield in 1830 you can see that it would have been very difficult to live in a city like this and be unaware of where your food came from .PERIOD
It even got built ,COMMA but nothing to do with this vision that Howard had .PERIOD
So I've come up with an alternative ,COMMA which is Sitopia ,COMMA from the ancient Greek ,COMMA sitos for food ,COMMA and topos for place .PERIOD
I believe we already live in Sitopia .PERIOD
So if we were to do that ,COMMA what might Sitopia look like ?QUESTIONMARK
Because without these kinds of people we can't have places like this .PERIOD
And equally important is the negative version -- Don't do to others what you would not like them to do to you .PERIOD
I sometimes see when I'm speaking to a congregation of religious people a sort of mutinous expression crossing their faces because people often want to be right instead .PERIOD
And so we have a choice ,COMMA it seems to me .PERIOD
And also see that it demands acute intelligence ,COMMA not just a gooey feeling .PERIOD
In this room ,COMMA all this expertise ,COMMA if we joined it all together ,COMMA we could change the world .PERIOD
Who knew about extension managers ?QUESTIONMARK
Now ,COMMA why would I care about Rome ,COMMA particularly ?QUESTIONMARK
These are just drawings of Rome .PERIOD I get back as often as possible -- I need to .PERIOD
These are sketches of some of the little details .PERIOD
Here's a little map .PERIOD And I thought of maps at the beginning ;SEMICOLON maybe I should just try and do a little atlas of my favorite streets and connections in Rome .PERIOD
Over the Spanish Steps we go .PERIOD
She parks her dirigible ,COMMA lowers the anchor rope and climbs down for a closer look inside .PERIOD
The text here is right side and upside down so that you are forced to turn the book around ,COMMA and you can see it from ground point of view and from her point of view -- looking in the hole ,COMMA getting a different kind of perspective ,COMMA moving you around the space .PERIOD Particularly appropriate in a building that can contain perfectly a sphere dimensions of the diameter being the same as the distance from the center of the floor to the center of the Oculus .PERIOD
Everything he sees from this point on is slightly affected by the linguine ,COMMA but keeps on moving because this guy's got a job to do .PERIOD
Then I thought ,COMMA Wait a minute ,COMMA what am I doing ?QUESTIONMARK
If I do a foldout page on the left-hand side and let you just unfold it ,COMMA you see behind it what I mean by scar tissue .PERIOD
Pigeon's Progress struck me as a catchy title .PERIOD
You can see the tombs and pines and so on and so forth along the way .PERIOD
This is something that's a little bit unusual .PERIOD
This is one of those things I show to my students because it's a complete bastardization -- a denial of any rules of perspective .PERIOD
I have all the pieces :COLON there's Santa Maria della Pace ,COMMA there's a soccer ball ,COMMA there's a little bit of a bird's wing -- nothing's happening ,COMMA so I had to rethink it .PERIOD
Thank you very much .PERIOD
So there's something super interesting about natural systems .PERIOD
The first two are the MacroBot and DeciBot .PERIOD
One of them is the input from the user ,COMMA as you're building your bricks .PERIOD
So each chain ,COMMA or each element ,COMMA wants to turn right or left .PERIOD
You're telling each unit if it should turn right or left .PERIOD
So you can basically program any three-dimensional shape -- or one-dimensional ,COMMA two-dimensional -- up into this chain completely passively .PERIOD
At the end of the lecture they asked a number of questions ,COMMA but there was one that's really stuck with me since then .PERIOD
And he reached the point where he felt that there must be something out there that was smaller than the smallest forms of life that were ever known -- bacteria ,COMMA at the time .PERIOD
As we started to look at this information ,COMMA we would see that about 20 percent of the genetic information in your nose doesn't match anything that we've ever seen before -- no plant ,COMMA animal ,COMMA fungus ,COMMA virus or bacteria .PERIOD
So can we have the lights off ,COMMA please ,COMMA so we can see it ?QUESTIONMARK
Well ,COMMA not quite ,COMMA not quite perfect -- you see ,COMMA in intergalactic space -- intergalactic space is completely dark ,COMMA pitch dark .PERIOD
That's how big and how dark the universe is .PERIOD
And that is how un-typical this place is .PERIOD
Now that is knowledge .PERIOD And if that weren't amazing enough ,COMMA the faithfulness with which the one structure resembles the other is increasing with time .PERIOD That is the growth of knowledge .PERIOD
Now how does the solar system -- and our environment ,COMMA in the form of us -- acquire this special relationship with the rest of the universe ?QUESTIONMARK
Well ,COMMA one thing that's true about Stephen Hawking's remark -- I mean ,COMMA it is true ,COMMA but it's the wrong emphasis .PERIOD One thing that's true about it is that it doesn't do it with any special physics .PERIOD There's no special dispensation ,COMMA no miracles involved .PERIOD It does it simply with three things that we have here in abundance .PERIOD
One of them is matter ,COMMA because the growth of knowledge is a form of information processing .PERIOD Information processing is computation ,COMMA computation requires a computer -- there's no known way of making a computer without matter .PERIOD
And the same -- well ,COMMA if we could do that we'd automatically have an energy supply ,COMMA because the transmutation would be a fusion reactor -- and evidence ?QUESTIONMARK
And with a more powerful telescope ,COMMA you'll be able to see stars ,COMMA and planets .PERIOD
And locally there you could build particle accelerators ,COMMA and learn elementary particle physics ,COMMA and chemistry ,COMMA and so on .PERIOD
The danger is not at all unprecedented .PERIOD Species go extinct all the time .PERIOD
And it's true that an ounce of prevention equals a pound of cure ,COMMA but that's only if we know what to prevent .PERIOD
The world is buzzing at the moment with plans to force reductions in gas emissions at all costs .PERIOD
They're not central to the human effort to face this problem ,COMMA or problems in general .PERIOD
And that is ,COMMA I understand that optimists greatly outlive pessimists .PERIOD
It's only 10 years ago this month when we published the first sequence of a free-living organism ,COMMA that of haemophilus influenzae .PERIOD
We can now do that same genome project in the order of two to eight hours .PERIOD
And we started the Sorcerer II Expedition ,COMMA where we were ,COMMA as with great oceanographic expeditions ,COMMA trying to sample the ocean every 200 miles .PERIOD
And with doing this ,COMMA we've made some amazing discoveries .PERIOD
I view that these genes are now not only the design components of evolution .PERIOD
Transposons are just small pieces of DNA that randomly insert in the genetic code .PERIOD
We found that synthesizing accurate DNA in large pieces was extremely difficult .PERIOD
And there's only two countries ,COMMA the US .PERIOD and the former Soviet Union ,COMMA that had major efforts on trying to create biological warfare agents .PERIOD
I think future engineered species could be the source of food ,COMMA hopefully a source of energy ,COMMA environmental remediation and perhaps replacing the petrochemical industry .PERIOD
It was actually a very strange study ,COMMA because the various religious leaders were using their scriptures as law books ,COMMA and they couldn't find anything in them prohibiting making life ,COMMA so it must be OK .PERIOD The only ultimate concerns were biological warfare aspects of this ,COMMA but gave us the go ahead to start these experiments for the reasons we were doing them .PERIOD
It poses a very fascinating puzzle for us .PERIOD
In particular check out Asia .PERIOD
Zoom in on Haiti ,COMMA in outline here .PERIOD
But Deng Xiaoping instinctively understood the importance of offering choices to his people .PERIOD
Demonstrated successes there led to a consensus for a move toward the market model for the entire economy .PERIOD
We can go do it over and over again .PERIOD
We also need the choices for people .PERIOD
The final thing we need are choices for leaders .PERIOD
Now ,COMMA when I say that ,COMMA some of you are starting to think ,COMMA Well ,COMMA is this just bringing back colonialism ?QUESTIONMARK
Let us have a Hong Kong nearby .PERIOD
Some of my citizens will move into that city as well .PERIOD
Many of them totally get the notion of a special zone that people can opt into as a rule .PERIOD
So let me show you why that's wrong .PERIOD
Take this representation of all of the land .PERIOD
Their kids can get an education .PERIOD
So what will it take to get started building the first charter cities ,COMMA scaling this so we build many more ?QUESTIONMARK
Let's have a system where we have ownership of land that is registered in a government office ,COMMA that people can pledge as collateral .PERIOD
15 seconds studio .PERIOD
Philip Zimbardo :COLON Let's tune into the conversation of the principals in Adam's temptation .PERIOD
Come on Adam ,COMMA don't be so wishy-washy .PERIOD Take a bite .PERIOD I did .PERIOD
I don't want to get in trouble .PERIOD
Life is temptation .PERIOD It's all about yielding ,COMMA resisting ,COMMA yes ,COMMA no ,COMMA now ,COMMA later ,COMMA impulsive ,COMMA reflective ,COMMA present focus and future focus .PERIOD
What determines any decision you make ?QUESTIONMARK
You can focus on past-positive ,COMMA or past-negative .PERIOD
And moderate on present-hedonism .PERIOD
They sacrifice family time .PERIOD They sacrifice friend time .PERIOD
I'm sure that resonates with some of the TEDsters .PERIOD
Told me don't eat that marshmallow ,COMMA because if you wait you're going to get two of them ,COMMA until I learned to balance out .PERIOD
And of all the places in the solar system that we might go to and search for answers to questions like this ,COMMA there's Saturn .PERIOD And we have been to Saturn before -- we visited Saturn in the early 1980 s -- but our investigations of Saturn have become far more in-depth in detail since the Cassini spacecraft ,COMMA traveling across interplanetary space for seven years ,COMMA glided into orbit around Saturn in the summer of 2004 ,COMMA and became at that point the farthest robotic outpost that humanity had ever established around the Sun .PERIOD
In fact ,COMMA just studying the rings alone ,COMMA we stand to learn a lot about the discs of stars and gas that we call the spiral galaxies .PERIOD
And these molecules high up in the atmosphere of Titan get broken down ,COMMA and their products join together to make haze particles .PERIOD
Try to imagine what the surface of Titan might look like .PERIOD
It's cold ,COMMA it's eerie ,COMMA it's misty ,COMMA it might be raining ,COMMA and you might be standing on the shores of Lake Michigan brimming with paint thinner .PERIOD
As I said ,COMMA it has a thick ,COMMA extensive atmosphere .PERIOD
We have instruments on Cassini which can see down to the surface through this atmosphere ,COMMA and my camera system is one of them .PERIOD
They look like they've been pulled apart .PERIOD
So it was -- I mean ,COMMA I'm getting goose bumps just talking about it .PERIOD
But this is somewhat of a shoreline .PERIOD
And obviously ,COMMA it landed in one of these flat ,COMMA dark regions and it didn't sink out of sight .PERIOD So it wasn't fluid that we landed in .PERIOD
And it's probably the case that this material has washed off the highlands of Titan through these channels that we saw ,COMMA and has drained over billions of years to fill in low-lying basins .PERIOD
And I think you would agree that we have found Titan is a remarkable ,COMMA mystical place .PERIOD It's exotic ,COMMA it's alien ,COMMA but yet strangely Earth-like ,COMMA and having Earth-like geological formations and a tremendous geographical diversity ,COMMA and is a fascinating world whose only rival in the solar system for complexity and richness is the Earth itself .PERIOD
It is a very geologically active body .PERIOD
Or this ?QUESTIONMARK
Really ?QUESTIONMARK
We're having trouble feeding six billion today .PERIOD
When we look at a map of Los Angeles or London ,COMMA it is hard to believe that as of 2005 ,COMMA only 15 percent of the world was mapped to a geo-codable level of detail .PERIOD
At Google ,COMMA 40 volunteers used a new software to map 120000 kilometers of roads ,COMMA 3000 hospitals ,COMMA logistics and relief points .PERIOD
Nobel Prize nominee Hernando De Soto recognized that the key to economic liftoff for most developing countries is to tap the vast amounts of uncapitalized land .PERIOD
Welcome to the new world .PERIOD
When I travel with my work across Europe and the United States ,COMMA one question always comes up :COLON Where is the Palestinian Gandhi ?QUESTIONMARK
Israeli Soldier :COLON A nonviolent protest is not going to stop the [unclear] .PERIOD
Julia Bacha :COLON When I first heard about the story of Budrus ,COMMA I was surprised that the international media had failed to cover the extraordinary set of events that happened seven years ago ,COMMA in 2003 .PERIOD
They had been using nonviolence for about two years but had grown disenchanted since nobody was paying attention .PERIOD
A week later ,COMMA they held the most well-attended and disciplined demonstration to date .PERIOD
So the human brain has about a hundred billion neurons in it .PERIOD
So beyond spatial memory ,COMMA if we look for this grid-like firing pattern throughout the whole brain ,COMMA we see it in a whole series of locations which are always active when we do all kinds of autobiographical memory tasks ,COMMA like remembering the last time you went to a wedding ,COMMA for example .PERIOD
Or better ,COMMA how do you explain when others are able to achieve things that seem to defy all of the assumptions ?QUESTIONMARK
Why ?QUESTIONMARK How ?QUESTIONMARK What ?QUESTIONMARK
We say what we do ,COMMA we say how we're different or how we're better and we expect some sort of a behavior ,COMMA a purchase ,COMMA a vote ,COMMA something like that .PERIOD
All I did was reverse the order of the information .PERIOD
In other words ,COMMA when we communicate from the outside in ,COMMA yes ,COMMA people can understand vast amounts of complicated information like features and benefits and facts and figures .PERIOD
When we can communicate from the inside out ,COMMA we're talking directly to the part of the brain that controls behavior ,COMMA and then we allow people to rationalize it with the tangible things we say and do .PERIOD
And Samuel Pierpont Langley had ,COMMA what we assume ,COMMA to be the recipe for success .PERIOD
The next 34 percent are your early majority ,COMMA your late majority and your laggards .PERIOD
