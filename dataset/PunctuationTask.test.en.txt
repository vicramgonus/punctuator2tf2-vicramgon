it can be a very complicated thing the ocean 
and we're making the ocean pretty unhappy in a lot of different ways 
people working in these canneries could barely stay there all day because of the smell but you know what they came out saying 
we made the ocean unhappy we made people very unhappy and we made them unhealthy 
we see the base of the food chain the plankton the small things and we see how those animals are food to animals in the middle of the pyramid and on so up this diagram 
now a dolphin mother dolphin any dolphin -- there's only one way that a pcb can get out of a dolphin 
and what's that 
here's a diagram of the pcb load of dolphins in sarasota bay 
and we also are eating meat that comes from some of these same places 
that's a tragedy for those populations but it's also a tragedy for the people eating them because they don't know that that's toxic meat 
these same infections create harmful algal blooms 
i started out showing how much we had distressed the monterey bay ecosystem with pollution and the canning industry and all of the attendant problems 
it's an ocean planet and we think of ourselves as a terrestrial species but the pyramid of life in the ocean and our own lives on land are intricately connected 
it's a huge driver for culture and i think that it's the most underrated force on our behavior 
the people in these studies report feeling so awake during the daytime that they realize they're experiencing true wakefulness for the first time in their lives 
so cut to the modern day 
okay we'll do something with it 
puppets always have to try to be alive 
it's their kind of ur-story onstage that desperation to live 
his mother was a puppeteer 
and in fact it took about 10 years to discover the bambara bamana puppets of mali in west africa where there's a fabulous tradition of puppetry to learn a renewed or a new respect for this art form 
so we made a model 
and we had a crate built for it 
we were going to test-drive it on the street outside of our house in cape town and it got to midnight and we hadn't done that yet 
a month later we were there in london with this big box and a studio full of people about to work with us 
and we went back to cape town and redesigned the horse completely 
and here is our factory in cape town where we make horses 
i'd just like to describe -- i won't talk too loud he might get irritated 
the ears are obviously a very important emotional indicator of the horse 
when they point right back the horse is fearful or angry depending upon what's going on in front of him around him 
the hind legs have got the same action 
and mikey also has in his fingers the ability to move the tail from left to right and up and down with the other hand 
and together there's quite a complex possibility of tail expression 
and it's very very simple because all that happens is that the puppeteer breathes with his knees 
but of course it was the cane is light the cane is flexible the cane is durable and the cane is moldable 
and it's driven and propelled forward by new leaders like many of the people here by new tools like the ones we've seen here and by new pressures 
what it tells is the story of how today actually could be as historic as 100 years ago 
now this may surprise you 
now we have wikipedia 
suddenly big things can be done for love 
take a look if you haven't at donorschoose 
the third category is represented by warren buffet which i call aggregated giving 
it's that he challenged another assumption that every giver should have his or her own fund or foundation 
we have got to realize that it is going to take a long time to do these things 
and that's where my imagined future comes in which i am going to call the social singularity 
we can create a future where hope and history rhyme 
that's why i have one last thing i want to show you 
and they were great community leaders 
i keep this photograph close by to me -- it's in my office -- because i've always felt a mystical connection to these two men both of whom i never knew 
and i want you to imagine that it's 100 years from now and your grandchild or great-grandchild or niece or nephew or god-child is looking at this photograph of you 
and what do i mean by that 
and i asked them to come along with the person they communicate with most 
what we're actually going to see is that fundamentally people are communicating on a regular basis with five six seven of their most intimate sphere 
he just wants to wish her a good day because that's the start of her day 
they chat to each other every day a few times a day actually 
but it could be in a school it could be an administration it could be a hospital 
if you were not you maybe had to go through an operator 
the phones were there but the expectation was once you moved in there your commitment was fully to the task at hand fully to the people around you 
this only started about 150 years ago 
they were living on top of the workshops where they were working 
companies blocking access to im or to facebook 
how you get it shouldn't make that much of a difference 
now two dozen men can tear down a mountain in several months and only for about a few years' worth of coal 
now judy and i -- i have to say -- totally related to each other 
so homegirls and hillbillies we got it together and totally understand that this is what it's all about 
and we know that eco-industrial business these kinds of business models -- there's a model in europe called the eco-industrial park where either the waste of one company is the raw material for another or you use recycled materials to make goods that you can actually use and sell 
and in my hometown we actually tried to do one of these in the bronx but our mayor decided what he wanted to see was a jail on that same spot 
this can support seasonal farmers around metro areas who are losing out because they really can't meet the year-round demand for produce 
and imagine a national business model that creates local jobs and smart infrastructure to improve local economic stability 
the recession has us reeling and fearful and there's something in the air these days that is also very empowering 
there goes my dog who led me to the park in my wedding 
i started my firm to help communities across the country realize their own potential to improve everything about the quality of life for their people 
hometown security is next on my to-do list 
the first few systems that we created they kind of worked 
so she expresses here what it's like to see someone halfway across the world having taken your idea built upon it and then acknowledging you for contributing 
and he was a clever man he sort of said well that's ok but you've done very well in your math sats 
it's taken at three o'clock in the morning without the permission of the company 
this picture was taken in 1982 just before the ibm pc was even announced 
and when people tell me who's going to teach the teachers to teach the kids 
what he observed was that kids who write computer programs understand things differently and when they debug the programs they come the closest to learning about learning 
this is in the early 2000s my son dimitri -- who's here many of you know dimitri -- went to cambodia set up this school that we had built just as the school connected it to the internet 
i can see any head of state any executive i want at any time because i'm not selling laptops ok i have no shareholders 
if you look at our professional services including search firms including communications including legal services including banking they're all pro bono and it's not to save money 
dual-mode display -- that sunlight display's fantastic 
and that was really critical the mesh network it'll become commonplace 
it wasn't just to kind of make it cute because somebody -- you know good design is very important 
if you're in a desert they can talk to each other about two kilometers apart 
use your mailing lists people in this room have extraordinary mailing lists 
and the world production today everybody combined making laptops is five million a month so i'm standing here telling you that sometime next year we're going to make 20 percent of the world production 
computers sort of came around through games and toys 
and you know the first computer most people had in the house may have been a computer to play pong a little microprocessor embedded and then other games that came after that 
yeah there's 38 million of them sold worldwide 
don't worry relax no relax it's a robot it's smart 
it can withstand a 400g shock the robot has local intelligence it can flip itself over can get itself into communication range can go upstairs by itself et cetera 
we had the robots down at the world trade center late that evening 
so one year ago the us military didn't have these robots 
he sort of does that but i'm going to -- chris anderson i'm just british rb oh 
okay he's pretty good yeah good good good 
and at different places in that space it expresses -- can we have the volume on here 
kismet do you really think so do you really think so 
voice look at my smile 
voice no no you're not to do that no 
we don't know whether he understood or not that the robot -- notice the turn-taking 
after all that's certainly what modern molecular biology says about us 
and for those of you that have teenagers you know what that's like 
and i don't think --  -- i don't think we're going to deliberately build robots that we're uncomfortable with 
and the watchmaker turned around and said god can see it 
but i felt something 
now you probably know the answer to this already 
i remember it clearly 
i thought well what the hell's that about 
now i'm not a neuroscientist 
and how much of that reactive side of it is due to what we already know or what we're going to learn about something 
and as we assemble these tools from a design point of view i get terribly excited about it because these are things as we've already said they're arriving at the brain it would seem before cognition before we can manipulate them -- electrochemical party tricks 
now when talking about beauty you can't get away from the fact that a lot experiments have been done in this way with faces and what have you 
i'm not getting it off the eyebrow 
anais nin and the talmud have told us time and time again that we see things not as they are but as we are 
ahhhh 
but i also know why it's exquisite to me because it's a palimpsest of things 
i mean if i just go through some of them now -- i know about laminar flow when it comes to air-piercing objects and that does it consummately well you can see it can 
why would you do that 
beautiful maybe lesser 
underneath this like the story of the swan is a million things very difficult to do 
so all hail to that 
the knowledge bubble that sits around the outside the stuff that costs nothing because that knowledge is free -- bundle that together and where do we come out 
and so i've stopped using words like form and i've stopped using words like function as a designer 
and for the last decade or so it's been quite clear what being an atheist means 
now i think it's too easy 
and what i'd like to inaugurate today is a new way of being an atheist -- if you like a new version of atheism we could call atheism 20 
i really like the art of mantegna 
i think there is an alternative 
we have secularized badly i would argue 
you know the kind of thing a commencement address is and graduation ceremonies those lyrical claims that education the process of education -- particularly higher education -- will make us into nobler and better human beings 
we need data we don't need help 
and so we need guidance and we need didactic learning 
they'd go no no i don't need one of those 
well a sermon wants to change your life and a lecture wants to give you a bit of information 
otherwise our minds are like sieves 
we associate repetition with boredom 
we're just going to run through all the old ones and watch them five times because they're so true 
the other things that religions do is to arrange time 
all the major religions give us calendars 
you won't do that by accident you will do that because you are guided to do that 
in the secular world we think if an idea is important i'll bump into it 
that's very good 
in the secular world you can come through the university system and be a lousy speaker and still have a great career 
what you're saying needs to be backed up by a really convincing way of saying it 
after every convincing point people will go amen amen amen 
at the end of a really rousing paragraph they'll all stand up and they'll go thank you jesus thank you christ thank you savior 
religions are fascinating in the way they try and combine the two 
we sometimes hear it said that museums are our new cathedrals or our new churches 
art is about two things in all the major faiths 
and if that thing is good there's no problem with it at all 
art should be didactic 
whereas the people who are selling us the higher stuff -- the therapists the poets -- are on their own and they have no power they have no might 
but you left out one aspect of religion that a lot of people might say your agenda could borrow from which is this sense -- that's actually probably the most important thing to anyone who's religious -- of spiritual experience of some kind of connection with something that's bigger than you are 
is there any room for that experience in atheism 20 
i would say that there are many many gaps in secular life and these can be plugged 
and as it happened i read it from midnight to five in the morning in one shot 
this is one of the largest underground labs in the world 
there is another way to search for dark matter which is indirectly 
when a neutrino hits a water molecule it emits a kind of blue light a flash of blue light and by looking for this blue light you can essentially understand something about the neutrino and then indirectly something about the dark matter that might have created this neutrino 
but nonetheless it's an extraordinary piece of engineering 
here's another view of the same 
the reason why you have to build these telescopes in places like the atacama desert is because of the high altitude desert 
and remember all this wiring is being done by people in extreme cold in sub-zero temperatures 
they're wearing about 15 kg of clothing and stuff but they have to take their gloves off in order to do that 
anil ananthaswamy and i'll finally like to leave you with two images 
they're going to learn from whatever it is they have around them 
it is by far and away the largest print library in the world 
then the question is what do you get 
it's starting to be a little bit more specified 
but i have to say that there's older technologies that i tend to like 
and it turns out to not be very hard 
you can actually get really good-looking books for on the order of one penny per page sort of the parts cost for doing this 
and so we've tried that and i'll go over that in a moment 
and it's called the espresso book machine and in about 10 minutes you can press a button and make a book 
and one of my favorites in this is the $100 laptop 
if you really care about books you're going to scan them better especially if they're valuable books 
so all in all that's going very well 
and so we're starting up a program to do out-of-print works but loaning them 
but it is within our grasp technologically and law-wise at least for the out of print and out of copyright we suggest to be able to get the whole darn thing online 
it's sort of the biggest tivo box you've ever seen 
it's about a petabyte so far of worldwide television -- russian chinese japanese iraqi al jazeera bbc cnn abc cbs nbc -- 24 hours a day 
so we've got about 100000 pieces up there 
and actually it's really been pioneered by alexa internet which donates this collection to the internet archive 
if we go and put it in a couple more places i think we'll be in good shape 
you'll eat countless gourmet meals 
not likely 
and this and then this 
day 21 day 23 day 25 
fungi don't like to rot from bacteria and so our best antibiotics come from fungi 
how is that possible 
the tallest plants on earth at that time were less than two feet 
the earth was struck by an asteroid a huge amount of debris was jettisoned into the atmosphere 
we were involved with several experiments 
there were four piles saturated with diesel and other petroleum waste one was a control pile one pile was treated with enzymes one pile was treated with bacteria and our pile we inoculated with mushroom mycelium 
the mycelium is producing enzymes -- peroxidases -- that break carbon-hydrogen bonds 
so i invented burlap sacks bunker spawn -- and putting the mycelium -- using storm blown debris you can take these burlap sacks and put them downstream from a farm that's producing e coli or other wastes or a factory with chemical toxins and it leads to habitat restoration 
there's more than a 100 million colonies per gram and 10 to the third power is around 1000 
in 48 hours to 72 hours these three mushroom species reduced the amount of coliform bacteria 10000 times 
this is a space-conservative method that uses storm debris -- and we can guarantee that we will have storms every year 
so this one mushroom in particular has drawn our interest over time 
and a few years ago we received these results 
10 or greater are considered to be very active 
and so for the first time i am showing this 
and we're using a natural extract within the same dosage window as a pure pharmaceutical 
so i went to the epa homepage and they were recommending studies with metarhizium species of a group of fungi that kill carpenter ants as well as termites 
the life box -- you're gonna be getting a dvd of the ted conference -- you add soil you add water you have mycorrhizal and endophytic fungi as well as spores like of the agarikon mushroom 
the seeds then are mothered by this mycelium 
i've also lived in biosphere 2 
well in 1991 it was finally time for us to go in and try out this baby 
the day i walked into biosphere 2 i was for the first time breathing a completely different atmosphere than everybody else in the world except seven other people 
we were taking their biomass storing them in the basement growing plants going around around around trying to take all of that carbon out of the atmosphere 
and we had no clue where it was 
and that you literally do that you stop breathing and then you --  -- take a breath and it wakes you up and it's very irritating 
and i recoiled they stank 
people stink 
i had no idea what was in my food where it came from 
and so we sent one onto the mir space station 
shrimp farms are a scourge on the earth frankly from an environmental point of view 
and understand its interactions with the entire earth 
now it may not seem like it but we are 
thank you  
what i'd like you to do is just really quickly is just sort of nod to the person on your right and then nod to the person on your left 
and one documentary writer who was here and looked at this two months after i was here described this not as beehives but as a graveyard with these empty white boxes with no bees left in them 
it was called that because a guy in israel first found it and he now regrets profoundly calling it that disease because of course there's the implication 
we needed beeswax for a project we were working on he was so capable he was able to render the nicest block of beeswax i have ever seen from cow dung tin cans and his veil which he used as a screening right in this meadow and so that ingenuity is inspiring 
and we see these families these nomadic families you know father to son father to son and these guys are hurting 
we have bumblebees on the top 
dennis vanengelsdorp bee okay thanks 
and in fact there is now a red list of pollinators that we're worried have disappeared and on top of that list are a lot of these kleptoparasites but also these bumblebees 
there are other animals that pollinate like bats and bats are in trouble too 
but i'm glad to say that i think we know the cause of all these conditions and that cause is ndd nature deficit disorder 
and that is make meadows and not lawns 
now not all of us have meadows or lawns that we can convert and so you can always of course grow a meadow in a pot 
and everyone should open a beehive because it is the most amazing incredible thing 
and if we want to cure ourselves of ndd or nature deficit disorder i think this is a great way of doing it 
she googled and she found this world whistling championship in america of course 
okay i'm not the only one whistling here 
and i want to first rehearse with you your whistling 
i start it myself 
but there is a much more fundamental mistake in the overall story of the ark that's not reported here 
so now we have god that is going to submerge earth permanently or at least for a very long period and no one is taking care of plants 
why 
this is not the common man 
you know very well about professors 
when he speaks about animals [he] tends to remove the fact that plants exist 
the blue whale the biggest creature that exists on the planet -- that is wrong completely wrong 
some of them are much more sophisticated 
many insects have been used by plants as vectors for the transport of the pollination but not just insects even birds reptiles and mammals like bats rats are normally used for the transportation of the pollen 
this is a serious business 
so we studied the root apex and we found that there is a specific region that is here depicted in blue -- that is called the transition zone 
now we know that a root apex has just a few hundred cells that show this kind of feature but we know how big the root apparatus of a small plant like a plant of rye 
they work in the same way 
well if you want to fly it's good that you look at birds -- to be inspired by birds 
but if you want to explore soils or if you want to colonize new territory to best thing that you can do is to be inspired by plants that are masters in doing this 
it's much more easy to work with plants than with animals 
thank you 
she's being filmed with a hidden camera 
so she's noticed the unusual thing but she's gone back to her normal life 
and we've continued to do it every year 
looking at the entire facade -- there were 70 total windows -- and i knew what i had to do 
so then i gave a new hand signal which signaled the next soloist down below in forever 21 and he danced 
this is the best buy in new york city 
and it's a very depressing place to be in the morning it's very crowded 
the participants at improv everywhere events have just as much leisure time as any other new yorkers they just occasionally choose to spend it in an unusual way 
and i think that's sort of the point of improv everywhere 
there was no way to predict how far it would spread through water supplies and how bad the situation would get 
it doesn't require any special training 
it's a quite wonderfully designed animal 
they have become domesticated and human beings have been redesigning their religions for thousands of years 
because what i've been doing for the last four years really since the first time you saw me -- some of you saw me at ted when i was talking about religion and in the last four years i've been working just about non-stop on this topic 
and you might say it's about the reverse engineering of religions 
and as with the cow there's a mixture of evolutionary design designed by natural selection itself and intelligent design -- more or less intelligent design -- and redesigned by human beings who are trying to redesign their religions 
it's like a coin flip it doesn't count really 
is it totalitarian to require reading writing and arithmetic 
i know many religions are so anxious about preserving the purity of their faith among their children that they are intent on keeping their children ignorant of other faiths 
this picture which i pulled off the web -- the fellow on the left is really an important part of this picture 
it wasn't the cleverness of the sheep at all 
if you understand orgel's second rule then you understand why the intelligent design movement is basically a hoax 
again and again biologists are fascinated with the brilliance of what's discovered 
but the process itself is without purpose without foresight without design 
well it's because its brain had been infected with a lancet fluke that was -- needed to get into the belly of a sheep or a cow in order to reproduce 
the key to our domination of the planet is culture and the key to culture is religion 
they'd want to know how it originated what it was for and how it perpetuates itself 
in that case a parasite gets into a mouse and it needs to get into the belly of a cat 
but i'm not just talking about islam 
i'm talking also about christianity 
you've all got a copy 
you've just heard the man 
first of all the goal 
the book is clear vivid accessible beautifully formatted 
just enough repetition 
and it would just be insincere of me not to address those problems 
that's worth mentioning 
you could stop reading this book because life would have no purpose or meaning or significance 
but that is just a difference of opinion 
that's not what i'm really worried about 
and here i think wait a minute 
is he endorsing creationism here 
your mind can handle 15000 decisions a second 
well there's a sense which i agree with him except i think it has an evolutionary explanation 
whose truth are we going to listen to 
and here's one that does concern me 
and i'd really like to get a response if rick is able to do it 
a very clever little meme 
in fact all of you as you sit here right now are vibrating 
every part of your body is vibrating at different frequencies 
it looks a bit like this 
the trouble with widespread headphone use is it brings three really big health issues 
it makes you tired and irritable to have to make up all of that data 
you're having to imagine it 
professional hearing protectors are great i use some all the time 
the elizabethans described language as decorated silence 
sound design is the future and i think it's the way we're going to change the way the world sounds 
it's a fantastic antidote to schizophonia to make music and sound in a group of people whichever style you enjoy particularly 
i'm leaving you with a little more birdsong which is very good for you 
we might one day see a shadow a black hole can cast on a very bright background but we haven't yet 
einstein realized that if space were empty if the universe were empty it would be like this picture except for maybe without the helpful grid drawn on it 
this is the hardworking scientist under harsh conditions 
he thought nature would protect us from their formation 
it's actually not massive enough 
it would be bad if we tried to fire our rockets and get out of there because we couldn't anymore than light can escape 
space squeezes and stretches as it emanates out from these black holes banging on the universe 
want to get away from the sound 
now that chirp is very characteristic of black holes merging -- that it chirps up at the end 
there are very industrious experiments being built on earth -- one called ligo -- which will detect deviations in the squeezing and stretching of space at less than the fraction of a nucleus of an atom over four kilometers 
it's everywhere it's all around you and the space is wobbling chaotically 
imagine a billion years ago two black holes collided 
if it was the big bang we were going to pick up it would sound like this 
and if we pick it up it will be music to our ears because it will be the quiet echo of that moment of our creation of our observable universe 
and our prison system itself is stuck 
funds for education for training and for rehabilitation are declining so this despairing cycle of incarceration continues 
we give science lectures and the men here are choosing to come to our science lectures instead of watching television or weightlifting 
we partnered with the nature conservancy for inmates at stafford creek correctional center to grow endangered prairie plants for restoration of relic prairie areas in washington state 
and just recently we've begun to work with those men who are segregated in what we call supermax facilities 
and so what we see i think is that small collective movements of change can perhaps move an entity such as our own prison system in a direction of hope 
it can't afford to doubt the person who tends the child 
that implies a lot of trust 
as the child grows it begins to discover that the person trusted is violating the trust 
you can be compassionate occasionally more moved by empathy than by compassion 
the tennis etiquette is both the players have to come to the net and shake hands 
compassion is not defined in one form 
that means the whole universe known things and unknown things 
there's no choice in this that only confirms the reality that the wholeness cannot be different from you cannot be minus you 
you express yourself because you have compassion 
there is no shortcut it is like swimming by swimming 
that's interesting to me 
you fake it and make it 
if you know how to pray pray 
well it has its pluses and minuses 
therefore we don't find the moral emotional psychological and political space to distance ourselves from the reality of social responsibility 
oddly enough an artist such as myself finds herself also in the position of being the voice the speaker of my people even if i have indeed no access to my own country 
we are there to take pride and insist on respect 
i envy sometimes the artists of the west for their freedom of expression 
our people depend on our artists and culture is beyond communication 
i work in morocco in turkey in mexico 
how to tell a political story but an allegorical story 
what was most significant for me was once again the presence of the women 
start differentiating into effector and memory cells 
we have a million students a month using the site watching on the order of 100 to 200000 videos a day 
and then in a response to that same comment -- this is on the thread 
but the paradigm here is we'll generate as many questions as you need until you get that concept until you get 10 in a row 
in a traditional classroom you have a couple of homework homework lecture homework lecture and then you have a snapshot exam 
but as ridiculous as that sounds that's exactly what's happening in our classrooms right now 
so you can imagine -- and this is what we are working on -- is from this knowledge map you have logic you have computer programming you have grammar you have genetics all based off of that core of if you know this and that now you're ready for this next concept 
it'll change what happens at the dinner table 
green means the student's already proficient 
and the data gets pretty granular so you can see the exact problems that the student got right or wrong 
and so the same kids that you thought were slow six weeks ago you now would think are gifted 
and i think what you'll see emerging is this notion of a global one-world classroom 
i'm still doing all the videos but we have a rockstar team doing the software 
and they're doing it at the district level 
and they're literally saying hey this is nice but   like that focus graph a lot of the teachers said i have a feeling that a lot of the kids are jumping around and not focusing on one topic 
but yeah it's all there 
and seeing with the brain is often called imagination 
so i am going to be talking about hallucinations and a particular sort of visual hallucination which i see among my patients 
animals too 
i see cats and dogs walking towards me 
she said it's got color it's got motion 
i said there is a special form of visual hallucination which may go with deteriorating vision or blindness 
and you have charles bonnet syndrome 
and about 10 percent of the visually impaired people get visual hallucinations 
now with the original description in the 18th century charles bonnet did not have them 
on one occasion he saw a man in a bathrobe smoking a pipe and realized it was himself 
these cartoons would be transparent and would cover half the visual field like a screen 
but what did disturb her was she got very persistent images or hallucinations of faces and as with rosalie the faces were often deformed with very large teeth or very large eyes 
in particular the notion is that if you see things or hear things you're going mad but the psychotic hallucinations are quite different 
and in particular one area of the temporal lobe is called the fusiform gyrus 
and now we know that there are hundreds of other sorts of cells which can be very very specific 
well i've more or less said what i wanted 
but they stop there 
well they don't disturb me any more than my tinnitus which i ignore 
they occasionally interest me and i have many pictures of them in my notebooks 
so it's a little-appreciated fact that most of the animals in our ocean make light 
i've spent most of my career studying this phenomenon called bioluminescence 
i also use it as a tool for visualizing and tracking pollution 
this is the first time it has ever been recorded 
so that light was made by a bioluminescent dinoflagellate a single-celled alga 
there's a lot of animals that use this trick for example this black dragonfish 
it's got a light organ under its eye 
it's a scream for help it's meant to attract attention 
there's other ways you can defend yourself with light 
this little squid is called the fire shooter because of its ability to do this 
this is a golden coral a bush 
we're talking to something 
but he's persistent 
we need more eyes on the process 
scientists have always created pictures as part of their thinking and discovery process 
in the top left-hand corner you've got this yellow-green area 
and those red molecules are hemoglobin 
and hemoglobin acts as a molecular sponge to soak up the oxygen in your lungs and then carry it to other parts of the body 
and that's how i really began so let's begin 
those are the letters of genetic code the 25000 genes you've got written in your dna 
but they physically run in opposite directions which creates a number of complications for your living cells as you're about to see most particularly when dna is being copied 
and so what i'm about to show you is an accurate representation of the actual dna replication machine that's occurring right now inside your body at least 2002 biology 
and it's jiggling and wiggling there because of the surrounding soup of molecules which i've stripped away so you can see something 
but in each one of your cells each strand of dna is about 30 to 40 million nanometers long 
it is made up of about 200 different types of proteins thousands of proteins in total 
that is the signal broadcasting system sending out the stop signal 
this is how you work at the molecular scale 
and we don't know exactly how they did this although they must have solved some collective action problems it only makes sense that you can't hunt mastodons while you're fighting with the other groups 
so that raised a social question that i believe must have driven new social forms 
again we can't know but we can be pretty sure that some form of symbolic communication must have been involved 
we saw scientific revolutions the protestant reformation constitutional democracies possible where they had not been possible before 
i'm going to talk briefly about two of them the prisoner's dilemma and the tragedy of the commons 
garrett hardin used it to talk about overpopulation in the late 1960s 
and most recently neurophysiological measures have shown that people who punish cheaters in economic games show activity in the reward centers of their brain 
jim surowiecki briefly mentioned yochai benkler's paper about open source pointing to a new form of production peer-to-peer production 
toyota instead of treating its suppliers as a marketplace treats them as a network and trains them to produce better even though they are also training them to produce better for their competitors 
i don't think we've even begun to discover what the basic principles are but i think we can begin to think about them 
i believe that the payoff would be very big 
what forms of suffering could be alleviated what forms of wealth could be created if we knew a little bit more about cooperation 
i don't think that this transdisciplinary discourse is automatically going to happen it's going to require effort 
i'm not going to dive into them either but photosynths are integrated into the map 
so this is something that we're now going to try for the first time live and this is really truly very frightening 
no no the other way 
this is the current -- thank you -- this is the current time if we scrub the time then we can see how the sky will look at different times and we can get all of this very detailed information about different times different dates let's move the moon a little higher in the sky maybe change the date 
all right now i've overrun my time so i've got to stop 
sophal ear so notwithstanding the 1970s narration on april 17th 1975 we lived in phnom penh 
they were young soldiers typically child soldiers 
so the khmer rouge took us from a place called pursat to kaoh tiev which is across from the border from vietnam 
and we end up in hong ngu on the vietnamese side 
and then onwards to chau doc 
thank you mother 
somebody has to be a witness to what has happened to you 
and one evening i was sitting next to a very nice gentleman in kabul and he asked what i thought would be good in afghanistan 
this was our sign -- it's hand-painted and we had 45 all over kabul 
we developed a culturally-sensitive psycho-social counseling approach 
and now you are helping me to regain some confidence in the future 
child there is no difference here between classes nor white or black nor if you have money or not 
simply if you are talented if you have the vocation and the will to be here you get in you share with us and make music 
in its essence the orchestra and the choir are much more than artistic structures 
that's how they build a spirit of solidarity and fraternity among them develop their self-esteem and foster the ethical and aesthetical values related to the music in all its senses 
all this makes up a constructive and ascending social dynamic 
it's what makes a little girl play the clarinet at home while her mother does the housework 
and these will be some simple design qualities and they will also be some qualities of if you will the intelligence of interaction 
now we've put people 18 inches in front of a tv and all the artifacts that none of the original designers expected to be seen all of a sudden are staring you in the face the shadow mask the scan lines all of that 
and my favorite example is always fingers 
in fact they're not it's really a very very high-resolution input medium -- you have to just do it twice you have to touch the screen and then rotate your finger slightly -- and you can move a cursor with great accuracy 
and we have never known how to do this technically so this slide is a fake slide 
ok so there is the pressure-sensitive display in operation 
the person's just if you will pushing on the screen to make a curve 
and what you can do -- oops i didn't mean to do that -- what you can do is actually feed back to the user the feeling of the physical properties 
what i'll show you very quickly is a new kind of book where it is mixed now with  all sorts of things live in there but you have to keep a few things in mind 
so it knows or at least there is computer-readable information in the medium itself it's just not a static movie frame 
now that would be if you will the top green track which doesn't mean too much but you might have to elaborate for me or for somebody who isn't an expert and say cook at 380 degrees for 45 minutes 
if you're in a classroom situation and somebody asks a question the last thing you do is repeat what you just said 
he says well reading is this junk they give me in little books to read 
and that story has many other anecdotes that are similar but wow the key to the future of computers in education is right there and it is when does it mean something to a child 
what the truth is is that speaking has great value to a child the child can get a great deal by talking to you 
well in senegal we found that this was the traditional classroom 120 kids -- three per desk -- one teacher a little bit of chalk 
that's what meant something to her is doing the hair pattern and actually did it within two days -- an hour each day -- and found it was to her absolutely the most meaningful piece  
and my last example -- as some of my former colleagues whom i see in the room can imagine what it will be 
now that is sufficiently zany that we would obviously jump to the bait and we did 
so if i all of a sudden turn to the person to my left and start talking to that person then at the person to my right's site he'll see these two plastic heads talking to each other 
and then if that person interrupts then those two heads may turn 
we're testing these kinds of simple sensor-network technologies in the home so that any phone that a senior is already comfortable with can help them deal with their medications 
and as we monitor phone usage by seniors over a long period of time down to the tenths of a microsecond that recognition moment of whether they can figure out that person on the other end is a friend and we start talking to them immediately or they do a lot of what's called trouble talk where they're like wait who is this oh right 
so sensors are looking at that kind of voice 
if they have a hip fracture we go with them and we study their entire discharge experience 
this is 50 tsunamis scheduled on the calendar but somehow we can't sort of marshal our government and innovative forces to sort of get out in front of it and do something about it we'll wait until it's more of a catastrophe and react as opposed to prepare for it 
this mentality of traveling to and timesharing large expensive healthcare systems actually began in 1787 
we have to shift from this mainframe mentality of healthcare to a personal model of healthcare 
how do we collect not just biological data but behavioral data psychological data relational data in and on and around the home 
they fixed her back up she was never going to be able to move back into the assisted living they put her into the nursing home unit 
i'm not bragging about how much we fund it's how little anyone else actually pays attention to aging and funds innovation on aging chronic disease management and independent living in the home 
and so that's what i've been striving for all of my life 
but instead i go out and i find things 
then i just pick things up 
and so at that time i was able to make some interesting hypotheses along with my colleagues 
the appearance of them would have been different -- which it is in all social animals 
in social groups of animals the juveniles always look different than the adults 
and probably a whole bunch of trees as well 
now it wasn't dna she didn't find dna 
we gave samples to mary schweitzer and she was actually able to determine that b-rex was a female based on medullary tissue found on the inside of the bone 
and so we built a laboratory in the back of an 18-wheeler trailer and actually took the laboratory to the field where we could get better samples 
i mean it was wonderful stuff 
so that's what i'm here to tell you about how we are going to fix a chicken 
we started out with a wolf-like creature and we ended up with a maltese 
and so that's what we're looking into 
archaeopteryx which is a bird a primitive bird still has that very primitive hand 
it has the three fingers the three digits 
birds have basically rudimentary tails 
but a gene turns on and resorbs the tail gets rid of it 
and people always say why do that 
what the frigoris you doing names are important 
now frank is this clear to you djabran fluctus 
listen i'm going back to the swamp mermaid can you call me in a little while 
so these are actual names of people that work there 
i did some more investigation 
there are some mapping people who do use their names 
so formulas relate number to form 
they got little babies in there floating in there 
it's a different kind of course and they've got five apples 
because that's why we're here really i think to figure stuff out and to love each other 
they are so different 
bode's law wasn't even his law it was a guy named titus 
just a correlation that indicates how things are misinterpreted 
golden section i've been obsessed with this thing since before i was born 
i know that scares a lot of you but that was my purpose entirely 
if fibonacci had been on paxil  that would be the fibonacci series 
yes mama 
there is so many intricate relationships that i'm not going to go there now because you would say hey go back to the fluctus part 
and i'm presenting it here at ted why 
it just seems like it's not sexy and elegant it's hidden 
and look at this built within it is the golden ratio 
thank you 
good afternoon 
in 1982 in the middle of the cold war in soviet siberia a pipeline exploded with a burst of 3 kilotons the equivalent of a fourth of the hiroshima bomb 
and with these keys they may have been able to get inside centcom's systems to see and hear everything and maybe even infect some of them 
as a result the americans take the threat very seriously 
i'll quote general james cartwright vice chairman of the joint chiefs of staff who says in a report to congress that cyberattacks could be as powerful as weapons of mass destruction 
moreover the americans have decided to spend over 30 billion dollars in the next five years to build up their cyberwar capabilities 
cyber weapons have this peculiar feature they can be used without leaving traces 
cartoons are basically short stories 
and that prompted people to make maps like this with all kinds of wonderful detail on the land but when you get to the waters edge the ocean looks like one giant puddle of blue paint 
and best of all i saw the animals 
could you image if we looked through the hubble telescope and we saw that 
it would start a whole new space race 
for instance take these sea turtles 
they kind of have a sixth sense like superman's x-ray vision 
they can sense the magnetic fields of the earth 
or take this sea cucumber 
he's sort of a homer simpson with fins 
he goes down and he meets this famous anglerfish 
the third storyline i did about a year and a half ago was probably my most difficult 
i do three or four strips after that where we explore the finning issue and the shark fin soup issue 
there was a real website based in china that actually sold shark fins so i kind of exposed that 
and you see you have a beautiful piece of white alabaster 
so you say to yourself well that's worth something 
so you go back into the room and you break this thing to pieces and you haul it away 
thanks for listening 
audience 22 
audience 47 
woman no 
594 let's give three of them a nice round of applause there 
what i'm going to try and do then -- i notice that took some of you a little bit of time to get your answer 
audience 23 
audience 59 
95218564 
eight-digit capacity -- don't you hate that 
in the meanwhile let me conclude the first part of my show by doing something a little trickier 
really scramble them up this time please 
for my next number --  while i mentally recharge my batteries i have one more question for the audience 
let's see starting with -- let's start with a gentleman first ok sir what year was it first of all that's why i start with a gentleman first 
yell it out what year audience 1959 
1959 ok -- and the month 
audience may ab may what 
it was ab and it was cloudy 
57683 squared yuck 
i'm going to break the problem down into three parts 
i'll do 57000 squared plus 683 squared plus 57000 times 683 times two 
while i explain something else -- -- i know that you can use right 
that seems right i'll go on cookie fission ok 
a third time it's just being a technician 
so i'm not going to talk about that 
get them out of schools and keep them out of schools 
having said that i outlined my talk about five minutes ago 
no if you want to know what society's going to be like in 20 years ask a kindergarten teacher 
but to me things aren't the future 
right away i hope that all of your eyes glaze over 
this is a klein bottle 
it's one sided it's a bottle whose inside is its outside 
it has zero volume and it's non-orientable 
it has wonderful properties 
that was a month of my life 
oh cool i can get to this place over here right 
i take lunch hour  
one of the things that i've done for my science students is to tell them look i'm going to teach you college-level physics 
is a constant when the frequency goes up the wavelength comes down wavelength goes up frequency goes down so if we have a wave here -- over here that's what's interesting -- as the pitch goes up things get closer pitch goes down things stretch out 
now so i know the frequency 
those of you who are physicists i hear you rolling your eyes but bear with me  
it's one of these bell-tower buildings 
i keep climbing up go back 
a dome one of these ten-foot domes 
in this light may science and religion endeavor here for the steady evolution of mankind from darkness to light from narrowness to broad-mindedness from prejudice to tolerance 
it's time for me to let it go 
we want space efficiency 
finally we want multifunctional spaces and housewares -- a sink combined with a toilet a dining table becomes a bed -- same space a little side table stretches out to seat 10 
guests move the moving wall have some fold-down guest beds 
thank you 
seriously but dangerously fun 
and there it is and i think this is a typical picture of what it was like in a courtyard then 
so i'm gonna take you through what i think is a remarkable sequence 
any of you who've been to africa or had a junkyard dog come after you there is a fixed kind of predatory gaze that you know you're in trouble 
and this polar bear stands over the husky no claws extended no fangs taking a look 
and it's that state that allows these two creatures to explore the possible 
they are beginning to do something that neither would have done without the play signals 
and it is a marvelous example of how a differential in power can be overridden by a process of nature that's within all of us 
john mentioned that i've done some work with murderers and i have 
if you're having a bad day try this jump up and down wiggle around -- you're going to feel better 
but it has to be safe exploration 
but if you look closely they're kind of like the polar bear and husky no claws flat fur soft eyes open mouth with no fangs balletic movements curvilinear movements -- all specific to play 
we all have an internal narrative that's our own inner story 
we don't know a whole lot about what it does for the human brain because funding has not been exactly heavy for research on play 
i think that -- that's a few years back -- i think that wave is past and the play wave is cresting because there is some good science 
now the program says that the opposite of play is not work it's depression 
nobody misses that dog i took a picture of on a carmel beach a couple of weeks ago 
you may not know this word but it should be your biological first name and last name 
found that when he looked at a playground out of a window into which he had been confined he felt something different 
and looking at his history which is common in the press it seems to me at least -- looking at it from a shrink's point of view -- that a lot of his life was programmed 
he had the expectations of his senatorial father and washington dc 
most of us work with groups and i put this up because the dschool the design school at stanford thanks to david kelley and a lot of others who have been visionary about its establishment has allowed a group of us to get together and create a course called from play to innovation 
so what will follow is a student-made film about just that 
but it doesn't have to be that way 
thank you 
if you stop a cat from playing -- which you can do and we've all seen how cats bat around stuff -- they're just as good predators as they would be if they hadn't played 
and if you look at sleep and dreams biologically animals sleep and dream and they rehearse and they do some other things that help memory and that are a very important part of sleep and dreams 
the next step of evolution in mammals and creatures with divinely superfluous neurons will be to play 
well i think the only way i know to do it is to have accumulated the advisers that i have who go from practitioners -- who can establish through improvisational play or clowning or whatever -- a state of play 
unfortunately that hasn't been done sufficiently for the national science foundation national institute of mental health or anybody else to really look at it in this way seriously 
so our diners started to get bored with this idea and we decided to give them the same course twice so here we actually took an element from the maki roll and and took a picture of a dish and then basically served that picture with the dish 
it's a glycoprotein called miraculin a naturally occurring thing it still freaks me out every time i eat it but it has a unique ability to mask certain taste receptors on your tongue so that primarily sour taste receptors so normally things that would taste very sour or tart somehow begin to taste very sweet 
as long as it's good for you and good for the environment it doesn't matter 
aside from one-person abc mini-bureaus in nairobi new delhi and mumbai there are no network news bureaus in all of africa india or south america -- places that are home to more than two billion people 
and can we afford not to thank you 
at this time there were thousands of individuals we think that were infected with hiv 
ok now more importantly had we been there in the '40s and '50s '60s had we seen this disease had we understood exactly what was going on with it how might that have changed and completely transformed the nature of the way this pandemic moved 
nevertheless we spend the vast majority of our energy focused on this level of the pyramid trying to tackle things that are already completely adapted to human beings that are going to be very very difficult to address -- as we've seen in the case of hiv 
so during the last 15 years i've been working to actually study the earlier interface here -- what i've labeled viral chatter which was a term coined by my mentor don burke 
narrator deep in a remote region of cameroon two hunters stalk their prey 
a group of hunters approach their packs loaded with wild game 
this is challenging work to do 
but -- when he began to speak they would actually recognize his voice from the radio 
so what happened so during the 10 years that we've been doing this work we actually surprised ourselves 
we made a number of discoveries 
it's something we should be following it's not something that we should be surprised by 
so it's not just hunters in central africa 
and somehow the idea that one would want to make art for the iphone which my friends and i are doing now is still not reflected in our understanding of what computers are for 
if you look carefully you can even see a hint of the apple menu up here in the upper left where the virtual world has literally punched through to the physical 
because this is in some sense the first way that people discover their own potential as actors and discover their own agency 
by saying who is that person in the mirror oh it's actually me 
song is one of our oldest ways of making ourselves heard and understood 
and so whereas dr oliver sacks has talked about how perhaps one person in a million actually has true synesthesia where they hear colors or taste shapes and things like this phonaesthesia is something we can all experience to some extent 
so the idea is you step into a kind of a magic light 
you know they don't imagine the person in the booth typing it all 
and it's one of the most interesting technical challenges that's very currently active in the computer sciences being able to have a camera that can understand from a fairly big distance away how these little tiny balls are actually pointing in one way or another to reveal what you're interested in and where your attention is directed 
and so i've been beginning with a variety of different projects to understand how people can relate to machines with their eyes 
in the first one which i'm going to show you called eyecode it's a piece of interactive software in which if we read this little circle the trace left by the looking of the previous observer looks at the trace left by the looking of previous observer 
but if i come up really close and stare directly at the camera on this laptop then you'll see these nice crisp eyes 
and what you're typing are recordings of your eyes as you're looking at other peoples' eyes 
and this exists in larger installations where there are thousands and thousands of eyes that people could be staring at as you see who's looking at the people looking at the people looking before them 
checking him out  
you say what you're doing in 140 characters or less and people who are interested in you get those updates 
it is by sharing these moments as they're happening that lets people feel more connected and in touch despite distance and in real time 
one of my favorites is what happened a few months ago when there was a gas shortage in atlanta 
it's happened more and more lately whether it's raising money for homeless people or to dig wells in africa or for a family in crisis 
evan williams nice thanks 
and i would like to tell you a few personal stories about what i like to call the danger of the single story 
my characters also drank a lot of ginger beer because the characters in the british books i read drank ginger beer 
i realized that people like me girls with skin the color of chocolate whose kinky hair could not form ponytails could also exist in literature 
but the unintended consequence was that i did not know that people like me could exist in literature 
so what the discovery of african writers did for me was this it saved me from having a single story of what books are 
so i felt enormous pity for fide's family 
if i had not grown up in nigeria and if all i knew about africa were from popular images i too would think that africa was a place of beautiful landscapes beautiful animals and incomprehensible people fighting senseless wars dying of poverty and aids unable to speak for themselves and waiting to be saved by a kind white foreigner 
now i've laughed every time i've read this 
so that is how to create a single story show a people as one thing as only one thing over and over again and that is what they become 
my cousin polle died because he could not get adequate healthcare 
what the nigerian writer chinua achebe calls a balance of stories 
what if my roommate knew about my nigerian publisher mukta bakaray a remarkable man who left his job in a bank to follow his dream and start a publishing house 
he disagreed he felt that people who could read would read if you made literature affordable and available to them 
what if my roommate knew about the female lawyer who recently went to court in nigeria to challenge a ridiculous law that required women to get their husband's consent before renewing their passports 
stories matter 
we face momentous decisions with important consequences throughout our lives and we have strategies for dealing with these decisions 
we've surrendered our power trading off our discomfort with uncertainty for the illusion of certainty that they provide 
it literally flat-lined 
but what my research has shown me is that experts tend on the whole to form very rigid camps that within these camps a dominant perspective emerges that often silences opposition that experts move with the prevailing winds often hero-worshipping their own gurus 
a recent study in the archives of surgery reported surgeons removing healthy ovaries operating on the wrong side of the brain carrying out procedures on the wrong hand elbow eye foot and also mistakes born out of thinking errors 
why was it that when i had an operation my doctor said to me beware ms hertz of hyperpyrexia when he could have just as easily said watch out for a high fever 
you see being ready to take experts on is about also being willing to dig behind their graphs their equations their forecasts their prophecies and being armed with the questions to do that -- questions like what are the assumptions that underpin this 
if we are to shift paradigms if we are to make breakthroughs if we are to destroy myths we need to create an environment in which expert ideas are battling it out in which we're bringing in new diverse discordant heretical views into the discussion fearlessly in the knowledge that progress comes about not only from the creation of ideas but also from their destruction -- and also from the knowledge that by surrounding ourselves by divergent discordant heretical views 
google ceo eric schmidt is a practical practitioner of this philosophy 
but just imagine if we were to junk this notion of expertise as some sort of elite cadre and instead embrace the notion of democratized expertise -- whereby expertise was not just the preserve of surgeons and ceo's but also shop-girls -- yeah 
thank you 
and so the thought that i started with was how do you do this still within the boundary of the science we know today -- no time for science fair no time for playing around with things or waiting for the magic battery to show up 
first component is you charge the car whenever you stop -- ends up that cars are these strange beasts that drive for about two hours and park for about 22 hours 
now that last mile last foot in a sense is the first step of the infrastructure 
what we found out when you move from molecules to electrons something interesting happens 
we have a battery bay it costs the same hundred dollars as the gas tank 
those of you who have a hard time calculating what that means -- in the average consumer environment we're in in the us 
that's a new economic factor which is fascinating to most people 
so we went out and we looked at all the car companies 
and i had to quit and come and do this thing called a better place 
we decided to come into the us 
the foundation of this curve is that we keep losing the wells that are close to the ground 
by 2015 we would have had at least 250 million new cars even at the pace we're going at right now 
and then we do the opec stimulus package also known as 200 dollars a barrel 
and that's the difference between problems that are additive like co2 which we go slowly up and then we tip and problems that are depletive in which we lose what we have which oscillate and they oscillate until we lose everything we've got 
you have to remember that the world today is bringing in so many cars 
you're looking at a world where cars are matched with windmills 
that's one percent a year 
and when we go to cop15 at the end of this year we can't stop thinking of padding co2 
we have to start thinking about giving kickers to countries that are willing to go to this kind of scale 
and there will be about a 20 percent chance we'll recover him 
we have to make it immediately 
and we need to do it not within 20 years or 50 years but within this presidential term because if we don't we will lose our economy right after we'd lost our morality 
they see us as rocking the boat and you can understand why 
now it may sound as though i'm about to preach atheism and i want to reassure you that that's not what i'm going to do 
essentially it does it by providing a smooth ramp of gradual step-by-step increment 
it turns out to be in principle incapable of doing the job required of it 
so we're used to not challenging religious ideas and it's very interesting how much of a furor richard creates when he does it he meant me not that one 
it teaches them to accept authority revelation and faith instead of always insisting on evidence 
but suppose --  -- in 1987 a reporter asked george bush sr 
whether he recognized the equal citizenship and patriotism of americans who are atheists 
she clearly feels in a beleaguered minority but actually how do american atheists stack up numerically 
the survey that i quoted which is the aris survey didn't break down its data by socio-economic class or education iq or anything else 
but let me know show you some data that have been properly published and analyzed on one special group namely top scientists 
in 1998 larson and witham polled the cream of american scientists those who'd been honored by election to the national academy of sciences and among this select group belief in a personal god dropped to a shattering seven percent 
similar figures obtained for belief in personal immortality 
i've not seen corresponding figures for elite scholars in other fields such history or philosophy but i'd be surprised if they were different 
and i've already hinted what that something is 
from what i've seen of ted i think this may be the ideal place to launch it 
again i fear it will cost money 
i suspect that the word atheist itself contains or remains a stumbling block far out of proportion to what it actually means and a stumbling block to people who otherwise might be happy to out themselves 
hence the phrase tooth fairy agnostic 
the onus is not on the rest of us to say why not 
but we don't bother to say so and this is why my friend uses tooth fairy agnostic as a label for what most people would call atheist 
when atheists like stephen hawking and albert einstein use the word god they use it of course as a metaphorical shorthand for that deep mysterious part of physics which we don't yet understand 
what i want to do this morning is share with you a couple of stories and talk about a different africa 
already this morning there were some allusions to the africa that you hear about all the time the africa of hiv/aids the africa of malaria the africa of poverty the africa of conflict and the africa of disasters 
this is a story about the fact that people want their resources managed properly for their good and not taken out to places where they'll benefit just a few of the elite 
because if we can get the 20 billion dollars sitting out there back it may be far more for some of these countries than all the aid that is being put together 
one in four sub-saharan africans is nigerian and it has 140 million dynamic people -- chaotic people -- but very interesting people you'll never be bored 
not the international monetary fund not the world bank where i worked for 21 years and rose to be a vice president 
you couldn't get it you had to bribe 
the smartest one first to come in was the mtn company of south africa 
nigerians themselves began to develop some wireless telecommunications companies and three or four others have come in 
and we had gdp grow from an average of 23 percent the previous decade to about 65 percent now 
we consolidated them from 89 to 25 banks by requiring that they increase their capital -- share capital 
in tourism in many african countries a great opportunity 
but you should know that this continent is not -- is a continent of many countries not one country 
but imagine the impact on a family if the parents can be employed and make sure that their children go to school that they can buy the drugs to fight the disease themselves 
if we can invest in places where you yourselves make money whilst creating jobs and helping people stand on their own feet isn't that a wonderful opportunity isn't that the way to go 
mixing african materials such as we have with materials from elsewhere 
and so to start helping that i want to take us back to 1835 
four and a half million users around the world contributing their leftover computer cycles whenever their computer isn't working by running a screen saver and together sharing their resources to create a massive supercomputer that nasa harnesses to analyze the data coming from radio telescopes 
what this picture suggests to us is that we've got a radical change in the way information production and exchange is capitalized not that it's become less capital intensive -- that there's less money that's required -- but that the ownership of this capital the way the capitalization happens is radically distributed each of us in these advanced economies has one of these or something rather like it -- a computer 
it used to be wireless was one person owned the license they transmitted in an area and it had to be decided whether they would be licensed or based on property 
it was too expensive to have decentralized social production to have decentralized action in society that was not about society itself 
it's that it's the first time that it's having major economic impact 
you have to hire them to spend a lot of time 
it's creating and it's most visible when we see it as a new form of competition 
peer-to-peer networks assaulting the recording industry free and open source software taking market share from microsoft skype potentially threatening traditional telecoms wikipedia competing with online encyclopedias 
and you see surfers people who see this happening and in some sense build it into a supply chain which is a very curious one right 
in 1918 a new virus appeared that killed some 50 to 100 million people 
it spread like wildfire and some died within hours of developing symptoms 
when they work they can make history but after a while you can barely hear them 
or polio how many of you remember the iron lung 
so let's explore how vaccines work 
when you're pre-immunized what happens is you have forces in your body pre-trained to recognize and defeat specific foes 
seth berkley really cool video isn't it 
in addition wild aquatic birds carry all known strains of influenza 
now luckily that particular virus although very scary at the time did not transmit from person to person very easily 
we've got these new antibodies we've identified and we know that they latch onto many many variations of the virus 
but you know the research that has occurred from hiv now has really helped with innovation with other diseases 
so far animal tests indicate that such a vaccine could prevent severe disease although you might get a mild case 
it was a slow cumbersome process that depended on chicken eggs millions of living chicken eggs 
now think of where this leads us 
new infectious diseases appear or reappear every few years 
will we be quick enough to react before millions die 
you also can use adjuvants which are chemicals you mix 
i call them the cheetah generation 
the cheetah generation is a new breed of africans who brook no nonsense about corruption 
now we're talking about a continent that is not poor 
there are people who think that we should pour more money more aid into this bowl which leaks 
let's take food imports 
just add that up all these leakages 
kwame nkrumah nyerere kenyatta -- somebody mentioned idi amin 
by creating wealth 
and you can't develop the informal and the traditional sectors without an operational understanding of how these two sectors work 
without the council the chief can't pass any law and if the chief doesn't govern according to the will of the people he will be removed 
so it's quite appropriate that this section is called a marketplace 
what africans practiced was a different form of capitalism but then after independence all of a sudden markets capitalism became a western institution and the leaders said africans were ready for socialism 
a bigger boat will mean more fish will be caught and landed 
they're people getting out of poverty as fast as they can 
and the journalist was asking him why is this so important 
they disappeared 
but a couple of weeks ago i asked a bunch of friends to google egypt and to send me screen shots of what they got 
and the thing is that the algorithms don't yet have the kind of embedded ethics that the editors did 
now i have to take off my shoes or boots to get on an airplane 
we went in and sat down at the booth and the waitress came over made a big commotion over tipper  
she said yes that's former vice president al gore and his wife tipper 
it's like beachcombing you know every time the tide comes in and out you find some more shells 
it's an easy visible target of concern and it should be but there is more global warming pollution that comes from buildings than from cars and trucks 
insulation better design buy green electricity where you can 
a lot of us in here have made that decision and it is really pretty easy 
it doesn't mean that if you are a republican that i'm trying to convince you to be a democrat we need republicans as well this used to be a bipartisan issue and i know that in this group it really is become politically active 
we have to buy a lot of those ads 
again the republicans here this shouldn't be partisan 
and all the burning of oil and coal and gas all the fossil fuels have changed the atmosphere greatly 
and one of the really most incredible things i think is that there's nobody out there trying to collect it at the site where it is densest 
you see people who are really shell-shocked 
so this is the gulf of mexico sparkling place full of fish 
you can see where the oil is concentrated at the surface and then it is attacked because they don't want the evidence in my opinion 
we heard that bacteria eat oil 
so do sea turtles 
when it breaks up it has a long way to go before it gets down to bacteria 
i heard the most incredible story today when i was on the train coming here 
that's the story of thousands of people 
the other thing about the gulf that is important is that there are a lot of animals that concentrate in the gulf at certain parts of the year 
if it's not it's certainly affecting their eggs and larvae i would certainly think 
so while the oil spill the leak the eruption is a catastrophe i think it's important to keep in mind that we've done a lot to affect what's in the ocean for a very very long time 
we're starting with something that's had a lot of stresses and a lot of problems to begin with 
it's just ridiculous 
i think that this is the result of gross negligence 
the first offshore drills were called harpoons 
your sequence and mine are slightly different 
i've got brown eyes you might have blue or gray 
i think we should say it all together 
and still you may not see the branches 
but seriously what's wrong with this 
you already know enough to tell me -- what's wrong with this statement 
and so let's do a series of comparisons to show you 
i assure you this is very tiny it's just six microns on a side 
and that's just a mouse brain -- it's a lot smaller than a human brain 
i feel curiosity and i feel wonder but at times i have also felt despair 
why did i choose to study this organ that is so awesome in its complexity that it might well be infinite 
and there's a lot of evidence that neural activity is encoding our thoughts feelings and perceptions our mental experiences 
and if you put those two facts together it means that your experiences can change your connectome 
and it might true that just the mere act of thinking can change your connectome -- an idea that you may find empowering 
and so we might even speak of the stream of consciousness 
i'll give you a hint it's a big number 
zach kaplan keith and i lead a research team 
because the way that he presented the concept -- his approach was totally different than ours he sold it to you as if it was for sale right now 
inventables water adventures dares you to launch yourself on a magnetically-levitating board down a waterslide so fast so tall that when you hit the bottom it uses brakes to stop 
in addition you can see from the diagram on the right the underpart of the slide would be an electromagnet 
so i'm sure all you engineers know that even though aluminum is a metal it's not a magnetic material but something unexpected happens when you drop a magnet down an aluminum tube 
it's perfectly clear it's odorless it's colorless 
shape-retaining is common in metal you bend a piece of aluminum foil and it holds its place contrast that with a plastic garbage can -- and you can push in the sides and it always bounces back 
so my favorite idea for this is to apply the ink to a book 
for our last technology we worked again with roman and his team at the directors bureau to develop a commercial from the future to explain how it works 
and these dyes change color in response to odors 
by detecting the odor of particular bacteria or viruses or even lung cancer the dots will change and they can use software to analyze the results 
because every one of these six changed our understanding of what was possible in the world prior to seeing this we would have assumed a 10-foot pole couldn't fit in your pocket something as inexpensive as ink couldn't sense the way paper is being bent every one of these things -- and we're constantly trying to find more 
thank you 
i mean it's crucified 
spanish chef accused of cheating 
a huge scandal for a few weeks 
that is until i went to eduardo's farm in extremadura 50 miles north of seville right on the portugal border 
i'm just here to give the geese what they want 
i was speaking too loudly 
right up to us like right up to here 
he doesn't 
so he got rid of the electricity he got rid of current on the inside and kept it on the outside so it would protect them against coyotes and other predators 
part of the income for his farm 
a big part of his income for his farm 
that's how i've been trained 
so i'm listening to all this you know and i'm like is this guy for real is he making some of this up 
is he like you know -- because he seemed to have an answer for everything and it was always nature 
because really they want you to look at themselves right 
and we're sitting there and i hear [clapping] from a distance so i look over 
to fly south in the winter and north when it gets warm 
and the problem with saying that of course is that you know at this point it risks hyperbole really easily 
i'm really in love with him at this point 
he takes the liver when he harvests the foie gras he sticks them in this jar and he confits it 
no salt no pepper no oil no spices 
we went back out for the final tour of the farm and he showed me the wild pepper plants and the plants that he made sure existed on his farm for salinity 
how come you don't give him this 
i really was moved 
the pharaoh got wind of this and wanted to taste it 
and the jews fearing for their life had to come up with an ingenious idea or at least try and satisfy the pharaoh's wishes of course 
one in which we stop treating the planet as if it were some kind of business in liquidation 
whether we're talking about brussels sprouts or foie gras 
that is our poetry that is our beautiful story 
ok i can see if i found something up up and they continue up up up 
you you survive it's ok 
nobody's obliged to be a genius 
it's better but nobody 
this line of evolution is clearly positive 
but if you take a lens like that this line is ack ack ack ack ack like that 
there is different type of barbaria 
that's why today i'm so ashamed to make this job 
but i know that even i do it the best possible -- that's why i'm the best -- it's nothing 
and because we must all work to finish this story 
this scenario of this civilization was about becoming powerful intelligent like this idea we have invented this concept of god 
you go to the future back back back back like that 
he would also supply me with tools 
it was this great magic store it was a crappy little building in midtown but you'd be in the elevator the elevator would open -- there'd be this little small magic store you'd be in the magic store 
and so i started thinking about lost and the stuff that we do and i realized oh my god mystery boxes are everywhere in what i do 
jack get him out of here get him away from the engine get him out of here 
man hey hey hey get away from -- jja now 10 years ago if we wanted to do that we'd have to kill a stuntman 
and i often am like you know dude today i'm out i got nothing you know  
so there's that in terms of the content of it you look at stories you think well what are stories but mystery boxes 
then there's the thing of mystery in terms of imagination -- the withholding of information you know doing that intentionally is much more engaging 
die hard right crazy great fun action-adventure movie in a building 
there are great scenes -- maybe not the most amazing dramatic scenes in the history of time but pretty great scenes 
father 'cause i need it 
come on so you think of jaws -- so that's the kind of stuff that like you know the investment of character which is the stuff that really is inside the box you know 
it's why when people do sequels or rip off movies you know of a genre they're ripping off the wrong thing 
you gotta rip off -- you know if you rip something off -- rip off the character 
because ultimately you know the mystery box is all of us so there's that 
the moment the lights go down is often the best part you know 
and you're full of that amazing -- that feeling of excited anticipation 
the stuff that i was lucky and begging for to get when i was a kid is now ubiquitous 
when i did mission impossible iii we had amazing visual effects stuff 
so eddie has this gun -- and he's the greatest guy -- he's this really sweet english guy he's like sorry i don't want to hurt you 
and i realized that we had to do something 'cause it wasn't working just as it was 
and tom would know just how hard to push the gun he wouldn't hurt himself 
and in the egyptian revolution the revolution 20 everyone has contributed something small or big they contributed something -- to bring us one of the most inspiring stories in the history of mankind when it comes to revolutions 
it was actually really inspiring to see all these egyptians completely changing 
but the reason why everyone was silent is what i call the psychological barrier of fear 
and that psychological barrier of fear had worked for so many years and here comes the internet technology blackberry sms 
platforms like youtube twitter facebook were helping us a lot because it basically gave us the impression that wow i'm not alone 
they probably have the best life in the world 
and everyone started to think that this guy could be my brother 
what are we going to do i don't know 
in a few days tens of thousands of people there -- angry egyptians who were asking the ministry of interior affairs enough 
but of course they don't listen 
in fact one of the most ridiculous ideas was hey let's have a silent stand 
there was no leader 
and i'm not going to talk about my experience because this is not about me 
the next day i was in tahrir 
when i saw that i went back and i wrote on facebook 
but today i'm going to talk to you about something you can't see -- what's going on up in that little brain of hers 
and therein lies a critical puzzle 
well it's got to do with your brain 
but we as adults are no longer absorbing those statistics 
it takes a human being for babies to take their statistics 
so this is little emma 
just as the poets and writers described we're going to be able to see i think that wondrous openness utter and complete openness of the mind of a child 
thank you 
and early in the morning i went into the ward 
i watched her hands as she bathed an old man 
and we run clinics in these very remote regions where there's no medical care whatsoever 
and he walked in and somebody said something to him we realized he was deaf and we looked into the rags and there was this pair of eyes 
the rags were unwrapped from a little girl whose body was massively burned 
it was the young women the health aids who cleaned the wounds of this baby and dressed the wounds 
and my family brought in a woman whose mother had been a slave to take care of me 
and that woman did not have sentimental compassion 
i had that condition to a certain extent from my own childhood illness 
and in that paralysis of course our capacity for compassion is also paralyzed 
the very word terror is global 
so our work in a certain way is to address this imago this kind of archetype that has pervaded the psyche of our entire globe 
hey we live in a very noxious world 
why don't we train our children in compassion 
women have manifested for thousands of years the strength arising from compassion in an unfiltered unmediated way in perceiving suffering as it is 
and they have actualized compassion through direct action 
he sees that the dog has this big wound on its leg 
i was one of the founding members of the axis of evil comedy tour 
then there was aron kader who was the palestinian-american 
and i opened it up it said born in iran i'm like oh come on man 
ah ha american great 
his name was jabbar 
he says you wait i'll be back and he walked away 
like a couple months ago in times square in new york there was this pakistani muslim guy who tried to blow up a car bomb 
and one thing that happened there was also the pakistani taliban took credit for that failed car bombing 
we just wanted to say we tried 
out of my way out of my way out of my way 
you want some frozen yogurt 
i have one gram five gram 10 gram how many gram do you want 
i put my two year-old on the slide he went frrmrmm he took off 
i went down i go where's my son 
i go i'm sorry then why were you staring at me 
so i would like to show you something i've been working on 
he had this wonderful trick where a rosebush would bloom right in front of your eyes 
but it was his production of a butterfly that was the most beautiful 
marco tempest when asked about deception he said this announcer magic is the only honest profession 
i use a lot of tricks which means that sometimes i have to lie to you 
girl in phone hey where are you 
lady i'll be ready in just a minute darling 
self-deception 
which is why in this vast and lonely cosmos we are so wonderfully optimistic 
put a crab inside it 
so the guy replies yeah i know i know 
i'm like a junior varsity cheerleader sometimes -- for swearing awkward silences and very simple rhyme schemes 
[ i don't need 2 write it down ]  i'm going to show you how terrorism actually interacts with our daily life 
now as many of you may remember the red brigades was a terrorist marxist organization which was very active in italy from the 1960s until the mid-1980s 
as part of their strategy the red brigades never spoke with anybody not even with their lawyers 
in 1993 they declared the end of the armed struggle 
but this is exactly what i did because i wanted to know what had turned my best friend into a terrorist and why she'd never tried to recruit me 
so because i am a trained economist and i think in economic terms all of the sudden i thought maybe there is something here 
and there are three main stages 
but above all they started to do serious business with the world of crime 
rogue economics is a force which is constantly lurking in the background of history 
and it actually happened again with the fall of the berlin wall 
what does it mean that means that it has a privilege that other countries do not have 
this privilege is called seigniorage 
no other country can do that 
what the patriot act did was to prohibit us bank and us-registered foreign banks from doing any businesses with off-shore facilities 
it also gave the us monetary authorities the right to monitor any dollar transaction taking place anywhere in the world 
it was introduced only in the united states 
in europe a similar legislation was not introduced 
cumulatively i will have rowed over 8000 miles taken over three million oar strokes and spent more than 312 days alone on the ocean on a 23 foot rowboat 
now some of you might be thinking hold on a minute she doesn't look very much like an ocean rower 
i thought there were them and there were us and i was not one of them 
and i think i knew from day one that it wasn't the right job for me 
i'd gone through some changes 
and i remember looking at these two versions of my obituary and thinking oh boy i'm on totally the wrong track here 
it was a bit like finishing a marathon and getting out of solitary confinement and winning an oscar all rolled into one 
mostly a baseball cap rowing gloves and a smile -- or a frown depending on whether i went backwards overnight -- and lots of sun lotion 
so because nobody in their straight mind would row straight past hawaii without dropping in i decided to cut this very big undertaking into three segments 
but what do you do 
i had a meeting with the president there who told me about his exit strategy for his country 
i even met one of them and she was just about my size 
this is a world-wide community 
i plan on being around for a long time and when i'm 90 years old i want to be happy and healthy 
it's very difficult to be healthy on a planet where we've poisoned the earth and the sea and the air 
and the idea here is that all our eco-heroes will log at least one green deed every day 
and if you put creation and optimism together you've got two choices that you can talk about 
this has been a really galvanizing issue for a long time 
this was a scheme by a team called think a new york-based team and then there was that one which was the libeskind scheme 
we all want to go out and buy an audi tt don't we 
it's in our nature to go ricocheting back and forth between this technocratic solution and a larger sort of more romantic image of where we are 
and these are two of the top architectural practices in the united states today 
yeah it's one of those giant camera lenses that takes a picture of the outside world -- it's sort of a little movie without any moving parts -- and projects it on a page and you can see the world outside you as you walk around it 
they all want to save money by building the same thing 500 times 
here's the little drawing that tells them how that works -- and that's what will happen in the end 
so let's make architectural sand dunes and a beach cabana 
so they went out and they modeled a computer model of a sand dune 
only one of whom had ever seen the plans before 
it has its own built-in swimming pool very very cool 
here it is going across and there down the other side and you get the same kind of grandeur 
i want you to know the room you're looking at is stark white 
rosa mexicano restaurant where he transports us to the shores of acapulco up on the upper west side with this wall of cliff divers who -- there you go like that 
boo hewerdine thomas dolby thank you very much for inviting me it's been a blessing singing for you 
right now is the most exciting time to see new indian art 
this next artist ns harsha actually has a studio right here in mysore 
he's putting a contemporary spin on the miniature tradition 
he creates these fine delicate images which he then repeats on a massive scale 
this next artist is probably the alpha male of contemporary indian art subodh gupta 
but i can only hope i've whet your appetite to go out and see and learn more about the amazing things that are happening in art in india today 
so i'm going to show you some ways that we can violate your expectations first of all i want to show you the particular illusion here i want you first of all when it pops up on the screen to notice that the two holes are perpendicular to each other these are all perceptual tricks these are real objects that i'm going to show you now i'm going to show you how it is done i've looped the film here so you can get a very interesting experience i want you to see how this illusion is constructed and it's going to rotate so you see that it's inside out now watch as it rotates back how quickly your perception snaps ok now 
how many of you here see dolphins raise your hand if you see dolphins ok those people who raised their hands afterwards the rest of the audience go talk to them all right actually this is the best example of priming by experience that i know 
now something like this can be used because this is after all talk about design too this was done by saatchi and saatchi and they actually got away with this ad in australia so if you look at this ad for beer all those people are in sort of provocative positions but they got it passed and actually won the clio awards so it's funny how you can do these things 
you can violate your expectations about experience here is an outside water fountain that i created with some friends of mine but you can stop the water in drops and -- actually make all the drops levitate this is something we're building for you know amusement parks and that kind of stuff 
well there's analog and digital thought that was appropriate here 
now i'm going to skip ahead since i'm sort of running [behind] i want to show you quickly what i've created some new type of illusions i've done something with taking the pixar-type illusions so you see these kids the same size here running down the hall the two table tops of the same size 
and it's interesting by doing this in this sort of rendered fashion how much stronger the illusions are any case i hope this has brought you a little joy and happiness and if you're interested in seeing more cool effects see me outside i'd be happy to show you lots of things 
so i want to share with you a couple key insights about complexity we're learning from studying nature that maybe are applicable to other problems 
i'm here today as june said to talk about a project that my twin sister and i have been doing for the past three and half years 
this is our invocation in crochet of a bleached reef 
so we went and taught the techniques we did workshops and lectures 
the frilly crenulated forms that you see in corals and kelps and sponges and nudibranchs is a form of geometry known as hyperbolic geometry 
and the only way that mathematicians know how to model this structure is with crochet it happens to be a fact 
before hyperbolic geometry mathematicians knew about two kinds of space euclidean space and spherical space 
and they have different properties 
think of the surface of a sphere -- just like a beach ball the surface of the earth 
and on the surface of a sphere a straight line is the biggest possible circle you can draw 
to a mathematician if there are two answers and the first two are zero and one there is another number that immediately suggests itself as the third alternative 
this nearly drove mathematicians bonkers because like you they're sitting there feeling bamboozled 
i've stitched euclid's parallel postulate on to the surface 
here's two creatures who've never heard of euclid's parallel postulate -- didn't know it was impossible to violate and they're simply getting on with it 
i once asked the mathematicians why it was that mathematicians thought this structure was impossible when sea slugs have been doing it since the silurian age 
and that's true but it also goes deeper than that 
and so too we've discovered that there is an infinite taxonomy of crochet hyperbolic creatures 
but we found that when we deviated from the specific setness of the mathematical code that underlies it -- the simple algorithm crochet three increase one -- when we deviated from that and made embellishments to the code the models immediately started to look more natural 
and kindergarten was actually a very formalized system of education established by a man named friedrich froebel who was a crystallographer in the 19th century 
he developed a radical alternative system of engaging the smallest children with the most abstract ideas through physical forms of play 
ok so how do you study this mysterious organ 
so let me give you a few striking examples of this 
and if you look tucked away inside the inner surface of the temporal lobes -- you can't see it there -- is a little structure called the fusiform gyrus 
but there's another rare syndrome so rare in fact that very few physicians have heard about it not even neurologists 
now the most common interpretation of this which you find in all the psychiatry textbooks is a freudian view and that is that this chap -- and the same argument applies to women by the way but i'll just talk about guys 
thank god or you would all be sexually aroused when you saw your mother 
it's very ingenious as all freudian arguments are --  -- but didn't make much sense because i have seen the same delusion a patient having the same delusion about his pet poodle 
there are neurons there that are sensitive to faces 
now when that area's damaged you lose the ability to see faces right 
and then the message cascades into the amygdala and then goes down the autonomic nervous system 
there's no delusion through the phone 
and in fact one student asked me the other day do they get phantom pms 
now why would a phantom limb be paralyzed 
how do you unlearn the learned paralysis so you can relieve him of this excruciating clenching spasm of the phantom arm 
he had a brachial avulsion so the nerves were cut and the arm was paralyzed lying in a sling for a year and then the arm was amputated 
my first patient came in and he looked in the mirror and i said look at your reflection of your phantom 
he knows it's a mirror reflection but it's a vivid sensory experience 
and he says oh my god my phantom is moving again i don't believe this 
and then i said close your eyes 
so i said look derek -- well first of all the guy can't just go around carrying a mirror to alleviate his pain -- i said look derek take it home and practice with it for a week or two 
i said what's gone 
these people muddle up their senses 
why does this happen 
now remember -- why does this happen 
and that is there is an abnormal gene a mutation in the gene that causes this abnormal cross wiring 
so every brain region is wired to every other region and these are trimmed down to create the characteristic modular architecture of the adult brain 
it's because you're all doing a cross-model synesthetic abstraction meaning you're saying that that sharp inflection -- ki-ki in your auditory cortex the hair cells being excited -- kiki mimics the visual inflection sudden inflection of that jagged shape 
now this is very important because what it's telling you is your brain is engaging in a primitive -- it's just -- it looks like a silly illusion but these photons in your eye are doing this shape and hair cells in your ear are exciting the auditory pattern but the brain is able to extract the common denominator 
sorry about that 
my talk will be in two parts i'll talk first as an astronomer and then as a worried member of the human race 
so that's another project for nasa 
it landed on the surface this is pictures taken on the way down 
there's scant chance of life there -- that's because there's been no time for the nuclear fusion in stars to make silicon and carbon and iron the building blocks of planets and of life 
and until we have that synthesis we won't be able to understand the very beginning of our universe because when our universe was itself the size of an atom quantum effects could shake everything 
you want to not only synthesize the very large and the very small but we want to understand the very complex 
we depend on stars to make the atoms we're made of 
we depend on chemistry to determine our complex structure 
the geometric mean of the mass of a proton and the mass of the sun is 50 kilograms within a factor of two of the mass of each person here 
if i was not a self-effacing brit i would mention the book myself and i would add that it's available in paperback 
first any scientific discovery has benign consequences as well as dangerous ones 
he persuaded einstein as his last act to sign the famous memorandum of bertrand russell 
we need not just campaigning physicists but we need biologists computer experts and environmentalists as well 
i wrote my book our final century as a scientist just a general scientist but there's one respect i think in which being a cosmologist offered a special perspective and that's that it offers an awareness of the immense future 
the stupendous time spans of the evolutionary past are now part of common culture -- outside the american bible belt anyway --  but most people even those who are familiar with evolution aren't mindful that even more time lies ahead 
the unfolding of intelligence and complexity still has immensely far to go here on earth and probably far beyond 
but let's suppose some aliens had been watching our pale blue dot in the cosmos from afar not just for 40 years but for the entire 45 billion-year history of our earth 
then other things happened even more abruptly 
right now he's in a forest in georgia 
the bonobo although shorter than us and their arms still longer is more upright just as we are 
slim-bodied bonobos are by nature very gentle creatures 
this is kanzi and i in the forest 
we need more sticks too 
good job 
video kanzi now makes his tools just as our ancestors may have made them two-and-a-half million years ago -- by holding the rocks in both hands to strike one against the other 
kanzi's rock is from gona ethiopia and is identical to that used by our african ancestors two-and-a-half million years ago 
she's also saying the name of that with her voice 
panbanisha began writing the lexigrams on the forest floor 
ss  very nice beautiful panbanisha 
the curved line is very similar to the lexigram 
the next symbol panbanisha writes represents collar 
researchers began to record what panbanisha said by writing lexigrams on the floor with chalk 
then he peers eagerly into his mother's mouth 
narrator kanzi plays the xylophone using both hands he enthusiastically accompanies dr sue's singing 
kanzi and panbanisha are stimulated by this fun-filled environment which promotes the emergence of these cultural capabilities 
so we have a bi-species environment we call it a panhomoculture 
here's a site which allows you to look at recovery spending in california 
in fact this is the graph of the number of data sets in the repositories of datagov and datagovuk 
and then you can select also other things on the map to see what other factors like the threat level 
the light blue is refugee camps these volunteers had spotted from the [satellite images] 
so if you've been involved in that at all i just wanted to say whatever you've been doing whether you've just been chanting raw data now 
a man-made moon visible by ordinary citizens it inspired awe and pride that humans had finally launched an object into space 
within a year congress funded huge weapons increases and we went from 1200 nuclear weapons to 20000 
support for engineering math and science -- education in general -- boomed 
and so if you'll put up with this i would like to enlist your help with a first experiment today the experiment is -- and i notice by the way that when you applauded that you did it in a typical north american way that is you were raucous and incoherent 
so what do we make of that first of all we know that you're all brilliant 
do you need to be alive i mean that's a spooky thought right 
and you see that in nature 
keep in mind that although it looks as if each individual is acting to cooperate what's really going on is a kind of selfish darwinian behavior 
each is scattering away at random to try to save its scales or feathers 
as i say if you're in a swarm your odds of being the unlucky one are reduced as compared to a small group 
there doesn't seem to be anything mystical about this 
specifically it's male fireflies who are all flashing in perfect time together in perfect synchrony to reinforce a message to the females 
scientific papers were published saying it was twitching eyelids that explained it or you know a human being's tendency to see patterns where there are none 
but i hope you've convinced yourself now with this nighttime video that they really were very well synchronized 
okay well the issue then is do we need to be alive to see this kind of spontaneous order and i've already hinted that the answer is no 
now you might think that's a bizarre idea 
he would shoot his light saber across the abyss making a blade of light and then scamper across on this blade of light 
think of the bridge as being like this platform 
narrator the most dramatic and shocking footage shows whole sections of the crowd -- hundreds of people -- apparently rocking from side to side in unison not only with each other but with the bridge 
this synchronized movement seemed to be driving the bridge 
but how could the crowd become synchronized 
allan mcrobie is a bridge engineer from cambridge who wrote to me suggesting that a bridge simulator ought to wobble in the same way as the real bridge -- provided we hung it on pendulums of exactly the right length 
their instructions just walk normally 
that indeed a mass extinction was underway in our fields in our agricultural system 
so if i were to going to show you all the beans in the world and i had a slide like this and i switched it every second it would take up my entire ted talk and i wouldn't have to say anything 
and i said you know what these apples come from your ancestors and your ancestors gave them the greatest honor they could give them 
the bad news is they're extinct 
the coldest growing seasons of the future hotter than the hottest of the past 
and then there are just daily disasters that take place in these buildings financial problems and mismanagement and equipment failures and all kinds of things and every time something like this happens it means extinction we lose diversity 
because quite literally if agriculture doesn't adapt to climate change neither will we 
important health message blogging may be hazardous to your health especially if you are a male 
this is male blogging posture sitting and the result is for greater comfort men naturally sit with their legs farther apart than women when working on laptop 
this is a very serious research that you should read the underline 
wi-fi enables you to avoid the processor and there are some enhanced protection measures which i would like to share with you and i would like in a minute to thank philips for helping 
i'm really troubled by that but anyway that's -- the basis of the thing that i want to share with you today though is that right back to where we inspire people who will be our great leaders later 
aviation week asked me to make a list of who i thought were the movers and shakers of the first 100 years of aviation 
well what happened when i was a little kid was -- some pretty heavy stuff too 
and this was at a time when mars was a hell of a lot more interesting than it is now we thought there'd be animals there we knew there were plants there the colors change right 
these two new airplanes are the same speed as the dc8 that was done in 1958 
here's the biggie and that is you don't have innovation cycles if the government develops and the government uses it 
computers were used for artillery first then irs 
keep that in mind i put down innovation -- i've looked for innovation cycles in space i found none 
and i think i want to talk a little bit about why we had the courage to go out and try that as a small company 
but i think once it does we will find solutions and very quickly you'll see those resort hotels in orbit 
there's a group of people that have come forward -- and you don't know all of them -- but the ones that have come forward were inspired as young children this little three- to 15-year-old age by us going to orbit and going to the moon here right in this time period 
paul allen elan musk richard branson jeff bezos the ansari family which is now funding the russians' sub-orbital thing bob bigelow a private space station and carmack 
there were a couple of examples here 
and i'm talking about if you've got a baby now or if you've got a 10-year-old now 
relatively soon you'll be able to buy a ticket and fly higher and faster than the highest-performance military operational airplane it's never happened before 
you can fly with russian hardware this is available because a russian space program is starving and it's nice for them to get 20 million here and there to take one of the seats 
and every dollar that flows into that will be spent more efficiently by a factor of 10 to 15 and what that means is before we know it the progress in human space flight with no taxpayer dollars will be at a level of about five times as much as the current nasa budgets for human space flight 
and this realization is allowing us to reconceptualize the way that we actually approach these diseases by controlling angiogenesis 
now i'm going to focus on cancer because angiogenesis is a hallmark of cancer every type of cancer 
this is a tumor dark gray ominous mass growing inside a brain 
dr judah folkman who was my mentor and who was the pioneer of the angiogenesis field once called this cancer without disease 
and unfortunately this late stage of cancer is the one at which it's most likely to be diagnosed when angiogenesis is already turned on and cancer cells are growing like wild 
we call this antiangiogenic therapy and it's completely different from chemotherapy because it selectively aims at the blood vessels that are feeding the cancers 
well i've just shown you two very different types of cancer that both responded to antiangiogenic therapy 
and we subsequently treated more than 600 dogs 
it had already spread to his lymph nodes so we used an antiangiogenic skin cream for the lip and an oral cocktail so we could treat from the inside as well as the outside 
and in fact the first pioneering treatments for people as well as dogs are already becoming available 
but the real question is how well do these work in practice 
so here's actually the patient survival data from eight different types of cancer 
but for other tumors and cancer types the improvements have only been modest 
and as a doctor i know that once a disease progresses to an advanced stage achieving a cure can be difficult if not impossible 
but i actually took a completely opposite approach and began asking what could we be adding to our diet that's naturally antiangiogenic that could boost the body's defense system and beat back those blood vessels that are feeding cancers 
this inhibits abnormal angiogenesis by 60 percent 
and you can see clearly that the teas vary in their potency from less potent to more potent 
this means there's food synergy 
here's some more data from our testing 
now in the lab we can simulate tumor angiogenesis represented here in a black bar 
soy parsley garlic grapes berries i could go home and cook a tasty meal using these ingredients 
and like a tumor fat grows when blood vessels grow 
albert szent-gyorgi once said that discovery consists of seeing what everyone has seen and thinking what no one has thought 
right and along those lines for people who might have risk factors for cancer would you recommend pursuing any treatments sort of prophylactically or simply pursuing the right diet with lots of tomato sauce 
well you know there's abundant epidemiological evidence 
i've designed puzzles for books printed things 
but at best they can reach for something more and create a memorable impression 
it's all figure 
not strictly an ambigram in the conventional sense 
now if you could pick up the black vase it would look like the figure on top 
here let's make it a little harder still pretty easy 
i wanted to make a sequel 
garry trudeau calls himself an investigative cartoonist 
and i said well how on earth can you come up with a sequence of the base pairs in dna 
and you have to choose pieces that overlap on the edge 
but it takes some persistence 
first of all you know for a long time computer games meant things like doom where you're going around shooting things very violent games very fast aimed at teenage boys right that's who plays computer games 
well guess what that's changing 
and it's a game you play with other people 
a lot of people do sudoku in fact some doctors prescribe it 
anybody 
what i want to talk about today is this particular cell or grouping of cells that is in each and every one of us 
i want you to imagine that this particular grouping of cells is central to the evolution of our species and the continuation of the human race 
and i want you imagine that at some point in history a group of powerful people invested in owning and controlling the world understood that the suppression of this particular cell the oppression of these cells the reinterpretation of these cells the undermining of these cells getting us to believe in the weakness of these cells and the crushing eradicating destroying reducing these cells basically began the process of killing off the girl cell which was by the way patriarchy 
to be a leader means not to be a girl 
and i'd also like to say that the irony of course is that denying girl suppressing girl suppressing emotion refusing feeling has lead thus here 
where we have now come to live in a world where the most extreme forms of violence the most horrific poverty genocide mass rapes the destruction of the earth is completely out of control 
in the congo for those of you who don't know there has been a war raging for the last 12 years a war that has killed nearly six million people 
listening to the story of 80-year-old women who were tied to chains and circled and where groups of men would come and rape them periodically all in the name of economic exploitation to steal the minerals so the west can have it and profit from them 
that shattering that opening of my girl cell that kind of massive breakthrough of my heart allowed me to become more courageous and braver and actually more clever than i had been in the past in my life 
i want to change the verb 
i want the verb to be educate or activate or engage or confront or defy or create 
i know a 14-year-old girl in the netherlands for example who is demanding that she take a boat and go around the entire world by herself 
and i want to talk about a girl that i just met recently in bukavu who was impregnated by her rapist 
she taught girls what a healthy vagina looked like and what a mutilated vagina looked like 
and she said well now i need a house 
the whole community has bought in to what she's doing 
she imagined her father killing her on one hand and mama agnes greeting her with the hope that she would greet her when she got to the house 
i had the privilege of being in the hut when she was reunited with her father and reconciled 
in that hut we walked in and her father and his four wives were sitting there and her sisters who had just returned because they had all fled when she had fled and her primary mother who had been beaten in standing up for her with the elders 
and that is the power of transformation 
but i really want to do it for each and every person here to value the girl in us to value the part that cries to value the part that's emotional to value the part that's vulnerable to understand that's where the future lies 
i rejoice that it's still in my body 
i am an emotional creature 
i can take you back 
nothing's been diluted 
i love hear me i love that i can feel the feelings inside you even if they stop my life even if they break my heart even if they take me off track they make me responsible 
your body is covered with fractals 
let's see first iteration second third fourth 
so native americans use a combination of circular symmetry and fourfold symmetry 
it is not the same pattern at two different scales 
in some cases there would actually be algorithms and very sophisticated algorithms 
so i tracked down one of the folks who makes these things this guy in mali just outside of bamako and i asked him how come you're making fractal fences because nobody else is 
so these guys are right on target for a practical use of scaling technology 
the most complex example of an algorithmic approach to fractals that i found was actually not in geometry it was in a symbolic code and this was bamana sand divination 
and finally out of desperation i said well let me explain georg cantor in 1877 
and then you take this symbol and you put it back in so it's a self-generating diversity of symbols 
and i know brian eno says there's not enough africa in computers but you know i don't think there's enough african history in brian eno 
we got a small seed grant just to see if folks would be willing to work with us on this we're very excited about the future possibilities for that 
actually the reason that google was such a success is because they were the first ones to take advantage of the self-organizing properties of the web

♫ lewis carroll i'm sure did alice ♫ sweeney what 
anyway i like oprah -- i like her girlfriendy-ness i like her weight issues i like how she's transformed talk television i like how she's brought reading back to america -- but there was something that happened the last two weeks that was  i call it the soon-yi moment it is the moment when i cannot continue supporting someone 
it makes what the bleep do we know seem like a doctoral dissertation from harvard on quantum mechanics -- that's how bad it is 
i want to try to share just a little bit of that with you in this presentation 
the challenge of course is to answer this question what permits this extraordinary performance of animals that allows them basically to go anywhere 
and if we could figure that out how can we implement those designs 
think about it if you were an engineer and i told you that you had to build an automobile but it had to start off to be this big then it had to grow to be full size and had to work every step along the way 
or think about the fact that if you build an automobile i'll tell you that you also -- inside it -- have to put a factory that allows you to make another automobile 
they all produce the pattern of a pogo stick how is that true 
we took their advice and we modeled the animals moving in the horizontal plane as well we took their three legs we collapsed them down as one 
it didn't decrease its preferred speed at all 
it has six legs -- there are the tuned springy legs 
robert full it'll go on different surfaces -- here's sand -- although we haven't perfected the feet yet but i'll talk about that later 
like if we had a piece of tape now we'd peel it this way 
they do this with their toes it's bizarre this peeling inspired irobot -- that we work with -- to build mecho-geckos 
and here's the peeling action of the mecho-gecko 
here's an individual hair with a little split end there 
no force is too low do they do it by electrostatics 
and just recently we've made a breakthrough where we now believe we're going to be able to create the first synthetic self-cleaning dry adhesive many companies are interested in this 
thank you 
we proved that most of the ammonia refrigeration tables are wrong 
most people have cooking fires in the world whether it's camel dung or wood 
and the problem is this women are not making it to the top of any profession anywhere in the world 
we also have another problem which is that women face harder choices between professional success and personal fulfillment 
and i said are you telling me that i am the only woman to have pitched a deal in this office in a year 
in the high-income part of our workforce in the people who end up at the top -- fortune 500 ceo jobs or the equivalent in other industries -- the problem i am convinced is that women are dropping out 
this is hard i feel guilty sometimes 
my brother is kind of busy 
because what the data shows above all else is one thing which is that success and likeability are positively correlated for men and negatively correlated for women 
this is the complication 
and that's a problem because we have to make it as important a job because it's the hardest job in the world to work inside the home for people of both genders if we're going to even things out and let women stay in the workforce 
message number three don't leave before you leave 
and literally from that moment she doesn't raise her hand anymore she doesn't look for a promotion she doesn't take on the new project she doesn't say me i want to do that 
my generation really sadly is not going to change the numbers at the top 
if you want to get at the big part -- i mean from a public health level where my training is -- you're looking at behavioral issues 
we talk about it in terms of engagement or non-compliance 
so the crux of it comes down to this notion of decision-making -- giving information to people in a form that doesn't just educate them or inform them but actually leads them to make better decisions better choices in their lives 
so they asked them at the beginning do you think you'll actually be able to stick with this program 
so fear showed up as not really the driver 
it was a notion that really came out of albert bandura's work who studied whether people could get a sense of empowerment 
it's an amazing notion 
and i had to explain they're trying to scare people 
again bandura recognized this years ago decades ago 
okay i know where i sit i know where i'm situated 
and that doesn't just work for me in terms of abstract numbers -- this overload of health information that we're inundated with 
finally we need to be presented with a clear point of action 
the choice in this case is pretty simple 
we either keep going fast or we slow down 
they reduce speeds by about five to 10 percent 
they last for about five miles in which case we put our foot back on the pedal 
and who among us would actually say that people who do try to read this actually get anything out of it 
they went to the nutritional information box and saw that what works for cereal works for our food actually helps people understand what's in their food 
they're just not for us they're not for people they're not for patients 
this is the worst presented information 
and then we go a further step -- we tell them what they can do 
so we take the bold step of putting the cholesterol information on the same page which is the way the doctor is going to evaluate it 
the last one i'll show you is a psa test 
and the only acceptable answer is --  -- yes 
okay on the other hand by placing your finger in a different position on the fingerboard it changes the string length that changes the frequency of the sound wave 
and now i realize that as the musician we human beings we have a great mind artistic heart and skill that can change the 16th-century technology and a legendary design to a wonderful entertainment 
but  although some of them were quite up there for me 
and i realized we actually had quite a bit in common both of us were disseminating the genes of one species and not another and both of us -- probably if i can imagine the bee's point of view -- thought we were calling the shots 
we have a grammar that suggests that's who we are that we are sovereign subjects in nature the bee as well as me 
and that's when i got the idea which was well what would happen if we kind of looked at us from this point of view of these other species who are working on us 
and agriculture suddenly appeared to me not as an invention not as a human technology but as a co-evolutionary development in which a group of very clever species mostly edible grasses had exploited us figured out how to get us to basically deforest the world 
and suddenly everything looked different 
i'm a dupe i'm a dupe of the lawns whose goal in life is to outcompete the trees who they compete with for sunlight 
so let me go through what you gain when you look at the world this way besides some entertaining insights about human desire 
as an intellectual matter looking at the world from other species' points of view helps us deal with this weird anomaly which is -- and this is in the realm of intellectual history -- which is that we have this darwinian revolution 150 years ago  
this is a farm in the shenandoah valley of virginia 
the idea is he's got six different species of animals as well as some plants growing in this very elaborate symbiotic arrangement 
and i'll show you if you take this approach what you get ok 
so one day cattle in a pen 
the eggmobile is a very rickety contraption -- it looks like a prairie schooner made out of boards -- but it houses 350 chickens 
so the chickens do their kind of little breakdance and they're pushing around the manure to get at the grubs and in the process they're spreading the manure out 
and within four or five weeks he can do it again 
put that in play 
so when they lose a lot of leaf mass they shed roots they kind of cauterize them and the roots die 
and they're labeled by color right now by language 
but you can also see there are places where there's not so much 
but it didn't have quite the same pickup in the us 
and so i guess the us finally finally started to like it too 
and it's something i'm very excited to be a part of 
but it was a dream of his and we basically when people really want to do something well we generally let them 
you can see even though the us is still the majority here -- though by the way search-wise it's only about 30 percent of our traffic -- but it's already going to japan and the uk and europe and all the rest of the countries 
and -- well i'll leave you in suspense 
so one of the things -- both sergey and i went to a montessori school and i think for some reason this has been incorporated in google 
and sergey mentioned orkut which is something that you know orkut wanted to do in his time and we call this -- at google we've embodied this as the 20 percent time and the idea is for 20 percent of your time if you're working at google you can do what you think is the best thing to do 
and this was kind of a surprise to me but we found that as long as you keep the 100 things in your head which you did by writing them down that you could do a pretty good job deciding what to do and where to put your resources 
so this is a new -- how many of you use the google toolbar 
and the nice thing about this we have a self-serve program and many thousands of websites have signed up and this let's them really make money and i -- you know there's a number of people i met -- i met this guy who runs a conservation site at a party and he said you know i wasn't making any money 
and so there is this blog of a young person who was kind of depressed and he said you know i'm sleeping a lot 
and i think we're really lucky to have that kind of business model because everyone in the world has access to our search and i think that's a tremendous tremendous benefit 
so i'm also fairly determined to try and build a game layer on top of the world 
it's not very good it's cluttered 
if you're not too bad there's nothing you can do 
it's actually about using dynamics using forces to influence the behavior of where you are what you do there how you do it 
come here at a certain time get your drinks half off 
this game dynamic is so powerful that it doesn't just influence our behavior it's influenced our entire culture 
they will return like clockwork at different times 
modern warfare one of the most successful selling games of all time 
it's also used in more conventional settings and can be used more consciously in conventional settings 
school -- and remember i made it through one year so i think i'm qualified to talk on school -- is a game it's just not a terribly well-designed game right 
there are statuses i mean what is valedictorian but a status 
that sucks why not level-up 
and it's very powerful 
i mean you see this is a paladin level 10 and that's a paladin level 20 and if you were going to fight you know orcs on the fields of mordor against the raz al ghul you'd probably want to be the bigger one right 
their most dedicated players it's like a full-time job 
and we've introduced a progression dynamic into it where by going to the same place over and over by doing challenges by engaging with the business you move a green bar from the left edge of the screen to the right edge of the screen and you eventually unlock rewards 
so we have to use this one carefully 
it's a woodworking machine or at least a piece of one and my task was to make this thing a little bit more modern a little bit easier to use 
now this gentleman isambard kingdom brunel designed many great things in his career in the 19th century including the clifton suspension bridge in bristol and the thames tunnel at rotherhithe 
his greatest creation runs actually right through here in oxford 
he imagined an integrated transportation system in which it would be possible for a passenger to embark on a train in london and disembark from a ship in new york 
and i'd like to talk about some of those just for the next few minutes 
so it took a team working in india with patients and community health workers to understand how a pda and an application on a pda might replace those technicians in a fitting and diagnostic service 
and the faster we do that the faster our ideas evolve 
this is the manufacturing facility for one of their biggest cost breakthroughs 
they went from retreating to the nurse's station to discuss the various states and needs of patients to developing a system that happened on the ward in front of patients using a simple software tool 
and this is just one of thousands of opportunities in healthcare alone 
but again we are in the midst of massive change 
how might we improve access to safe drinking water for the world's poorest people and at the same time stimulate innovation amongst local water providers 
what kinds of questions do we think design thinking could be used to tackle 
there is a hash tag there that you can use #cbdq 
well since i couldn't have my tea the way i wanted it i ordered a cup of coffee which the waiter brought over promptly 
but from the japanese perspective it's their duty to protect those who don't know any better --  in this case the ignorant gaijin -- from making the wrong choice 
as i do so i hope you'll start thinking about some of your own assumptions and how they were shaped by your backgrounds 
it is essential for success 
the kids got to choose which pile of anagrams they would like to do and they even got to choose which marker they would write their answers with 
in reality the kids who were told what to do whether by miss smith or their mothers were actually given the very same activity which their counterparts in the first group had freely chosen 
in fact some of the kids were visibly embarrassed when they were told that their mothers had been consulted 
the first-generation children were strongly influenced by their immigrant parents' approach to choice 
or you could say that the individual's preferences were shaped by the preferences of specific others 
americans train their whole lives to play spot the difference 
a number of my studies have shown that when you give people 10 or more options when they're making a choice they make poorer decisions whether it be health care investment other critical areas 
they'd already picked out a name for her barbara after her grandmother 
unable to breathe on her own she was put on a ventilator 
this narrative promises so much freedom happiness success 
instead of replacing one story with another we can learn from and revel in the many versions that exist and the many that have yet to be written 
no matter where we're from and what your narrative is we all have a responsibility to open ourselves up to a wider array of what choice can do and what it can represent 
it brings us that much closer to realizing the full potential of choice to inspiring the hope and achieving the freedom that choice promises but doesn't always deliver 
so i brought these two bottles of nail polish into the laboratory and i stripped the labels off 
well good morning 
and it's not just what these are doing to each other but it's what the audience thinks that really frames this matter 
to get a sense of this and it's been a theme we've talked about all week i recently talked to a bunch of tweeners 
girl 5 because they're going to lose all their money eventually 
doesn't work out too well for them they lose money 
the rocket's position is shown by the trajectory that we're now looking at 
and as it reaches the peak of its trajectory the velocity you will notice has dropped off to a minimum 
but like let's imagine we took the latest pentium processor the latest core 2 extreme which is a four-core processor that intel's working on it will be our laptop tomorrow 
so -- and we haven't even worked out the cooling needs 
every effort has been made and will continue to be made to find a new pattern new selling arrangements and new types of programs that may arrest the declining revenues 
it may yet be possible to eke out a poor existence for radio but i don't know how 
it was the dawn of interactive tv and you may have noticed they wanted to sell you the winky dink kits 
pete i could use any ordinary open-source crayon why do i have to buy theirs 
but we will discuss this scandal because this man jack berry the host of winky dink went on to become the host of twenty one one of the most important quiz shows ever 
we'll talk a little bit more about him later 
it's the era of big business and data centers for computing 
it all happened within five miles of where i'm standing at stanford university between 1960 and 1975 
hypercard was the first program to introduce the public to hyperlinks where you could randomly hook to any kind of picture or piece of text or data across a file system and we had no way of explaining it 
once it was only a dream of technoids and a few long-forgotten politicians 
and further stimulus came with the deregulation of the cable television industry and the re-regulation of the cable television industry 
voice 2 next on the gourmet pet channel decorating birthday cakes for your schnauzer 
we come into the era of the dotcom the world wide web and i don't need to tell you about that because we all went through that bubble together 
voice 1 you'll have to stay here in the safe house until we get word the terrorist threat is over 
and media companies realize the audience is important also 
and i think this is beginning to happen in the entertainment business 
they think of the old medium because the old medium is always the content of the new medium as movies tend to be the content of tv and as books used to be the content novels used to be the content of movies 
and i used three criteria the first was i thought i'd talk about real design within reach design that's free not design not quite within reach as we're fondly known by our competition and competitors but stuff that you can find on the streets stuff that was free stuff that was available to all people and stuff that probably contains some other important messages 
wholly inconsistent with san francisco or new york 
how did i get started in this business 
in italy you know almost everything kind of looks good 
i've come across some other just kind of curious relationships of bollards on the street that have different interpretations but -- these things amuse me 
and i came down one day and all the bikes were red 
and at that moment the sun came out and through this perforated screen a pattern was cast over these bodies and they kind of faded into the rear and we left the restaurant kind of feeling ok about stuff 
cities are the place where we're most likely to encounter diversity and to mix with other people 
and it's a welcoming area i think inclusive of diversity reflective of diversity and i think this marriage of both technology and art in the public sector is an area where the us 
and i decided i had to get closer than just drawing fantasy airplanes 
you had to learn what made an airplane stay in the air 
i had to learn mathematics and mechanics and all this sort of thing 
so i chose furniture 
and i chose chairs specifically because i knew something about them 
there are drawbacks to this 
one is you can't accommodate everybody 
so he said well i'll come over and look at it 
so here we are 
so if you watch this chair as i recline the headrest comes up to meet my neck 
you cant hit your elbow on bottom 
what does that mean my environment 
and you realize that you spend it in a variety of different places 
you spend it at rest and you spend it at work 
so then i decided to leave that part of the world and i was going to go to the mid-west 
very nice and there my older senior lungs as i like to call them i filled with particulate matter carbon dioxide and very high doses of ozone 
okay almost like the highest in the nation 
so what's wrong with this picture 
they haven't asked me what kind of the quality of the drinking water that i put in my mouth or the food that i ingest into my stomach 
now i've circled the places where i've been 
oh not so lucky 
they give us some sense of what's going to be our train wreck 
and all of those black dots are all of the toxic release inventories that are monitored by the epa 
this is what the physician would have in front of him and her when we enter that exam room instead of just the pink slip that said i paid at the counter right 
and i believe that geographic information can make both you and me very healthy thank you 
so  
they take you to gruff-ex-cop-on-his-fourth-marriagedad 
i'd be like some kind of internet genius and me i'd like to upgrade to deity and maybe just like that -- pop -- i'd go wireless 
i could zip through your servers and firewalls like a virus until the world wide web is as wise as wild and as organized as i think a modern-day miracle/oracle can get but ooh-eee you want to bet just how whack and un-pc your mac or pc is going to be when i'm rocking hot-shit-hot-shot-godnet 
you don't say a prayer 
thank you ted 
so for roughly 300 years the hot debate in architecture was whether the number five or the number seven was a better proportion to think about architecture because the nose was one-fifth of your head or because your head was one-seventh of your body 
so whenever you lost information you'd move to symmetry whenever you added information to a system you would break symmetry 
now the only way we could design that or possibly construct it is by using a calculus-based definition of the form 
it also is much more dynamic so that you can see that the same form opens and closes in a very dynamic way as you move across it because it has this quality of vector in motion built into it 
you just need to incorporate a certain number of traits in a very kind of genetic way 
i won't go into too much description of any of these projects but what you can see is that the escalators and elevators that circulate people along the face of the building are all held up by 122 structural trusses 
so working with bentley and microstation we've written a custom piece of software that networks all of the components together into these chunks of information so that if we change any element along the length of the building not only does that change distribute through each one of the trusses but each one of the trusses then distributes that information down the length of the entire facade of the building 
but what it gives us is a harmonic and synthesized relationship of all these components one to another 
at the same time there's a person paying 30000 dollars for a 300-series car and a person paying 70000 dollars for a 700 series and that person paying more than double doesn't want their car to look too much like the bottom-of-the-market car 
so they have to also discriminate between these products 
to go back to architecture what's organic about architecture as a field unlike product design is this whole issue of holism and of monumentality is really our realm 
and to do that we tried to connect up the five towers into a single system 
with united architects also we made a proposal for the european central bank headquarters that used the same system but this time in a much more monolithic mass like a sphere 
so for these interiors like this shop in stockholm sweden or this installation wall in the netherlands at the netherlands architecture institute we could use the texture that the tool would leave to produce a lot of the spatial effects and we could integrate the texture of the wall with the form of the wall with the material 
what i'd like to do is just drag us all down into the gutter and actually all the way down into the sewer because i want to talk about diarrhea 
and in particular i want to talk about the design of diarrhea 
if instead transmission to another host requires host mobility then we expect that the winners of the competition will be the milder organisms 
so one way you can test is just look at all diarrheal bacteria and see whether or not the ones that tend to be more transmitted by water tend to be more harmful 
after a few days of infection you end up having -- the fecal material really isn't so disgusting as we might imagine 
and if you took a drop of that water you might find a million diarrheal organisms 
if it didn't produce a lot of this toxin then you might find a smaller number 
so the task is to try to figure out how to determine whether or not you could get an organism like this to evolve towards mildness by blocking waterborne transmission thereby allowing the organism only to be transmitted by person-to-person contact or person-food-person contact -- both of which would really require that people be mobile and fairly healthy for transmission 
one would be to take a lot of different strains of this organism -- some that produce a lot of toxins some that produce a little -- and take those strains and spew them out in different countries 
so we don't want to run an experiment like that 
now i don't know how that happened and i didn't have anything to do with it i promise you 
the goal is to turn this around 
if you could cause an evolutionary decrease in virulence by cleaning up the water supply you should be able to get an evolutionary decrease in antibiotic resistance 
and i want to give you just one more example because we've talked a little bit about malaria 
in the case of malaria what we'd like to do is mosquito-proof houses 
the only pathogens that get transmitted are the ones that are infecting people that feel healthy enough to walk outside and get mosquito bites 
so i don't really have time to talk about those things but i did want to put them up there just to give you a sense that there really are solutions to controlling the evolution of harmfulness of some of the nasty pathogens that we're confronted with 
and the data really do support this that you actually do get the virus evolving towards mildness 
anyhow i'll end that there and thank you very much 
our hands are amazing instruments 
and when they're missing it's a barrier 
every time you contract a muscle it emits a little electricity that you can record with antennae or electrodes and use that to operate the motorized prosthesis 
well the body works by starting a motor command in your brain going down your spinal cord out the nerves and to your periphery 
and we take the nerve away from your chest muscle and let these nerves grow into it 
now you think close hand and a little section of your chest contracts 
and jesse's a good crane operator and he did okay by our standards 
so this is really exciting for us because now we have a portal a portal or a way to potentially give back sensation so that he might feel what he touches with his prosthetic hand 
we've also gone on with what was initially our primary population of people with above-the-elbow amputations 
you had to concentrate a whole lot 
then we fit her with a prosthesis 
a little faster and much more easy much more natural 
there's a lot of information in those nerve signals and we wanted to get more 
and here you can see on jesse's chest when he just tried to do three different things you can see three different patterns 
obviously that's heavy for amanda 
it took just about probably three to four hours to get it to train 
so we're really excited because now we're getting to a clinically practical device 
i want you to watch closely 
that's claudia and that was the first time she got to feel sensation through her prosthetic 
once we can do it that small it's a lot easier making them bigger 
so amanda came jet-lagged she's using the arm and everything goes wrong 
and none of those problems could i have dealt with but i have a really bright research team 
but first i want to start by saying that we need a new operating system for the oceans and for the earth 
because we've only doubled the population of the earth since the 1960s -- a little more than doubled -- but we have 67 billion people in the world and we all like to consume 
humans without fins 90 meters 35 minutes 
so penguins are amazing athletes 
and more importantly they're well-dressed 
if you go and do it now the national parks count about 500 
so we have a quarter of the penguins that we did 40 years ago 
when we have extreme el nino events you see all this red and you see no green out here around the galapagos 
things die when there's no food 
and if you look along the coast of argentina where i work now at a place called punta tombo -- the largest magellanic penguin colony in the world down here about 44 degrees south latitude -- you see that there's great variation here 
and so we have started a global penguin society to try to focus on the real plight of penguins 
they ended up swimming through ballast water that had oil in it 
so we ended up spending nine years convincing the government that there were lots of oiled penguins 
and of course all of this then leads to a vicious cycle and you can't raise a lot of chicks 
turbo has taken to knocking on the door with his beak we let him in and he comes in here 
so this is turbo 
and now he's looking at the other guy saying you are really weird 
most important thing is only you can change yourself and only you can change the world and make it better for people as well as penguins 
but let's talk about the 90 percent of the world population that will never leave the place in which they were born 
over 50 new countries were born 
and they share a lengthy land border 
in fact the world bank predicts that russia's population is declining towards about 120 million people and there is another thing that you don't see on this map 
stalin khrushchev and other soviet leaders forced russians out to the far east to be in gulags labor camps nuclear cities whatever the case was 
as a result in the russian far east today which is twice the size of india you have exactly six million russians 
because globalization opens up all kinds of ways for us to undermine and change the way we think about political geography 
remember the 40 dots on the nighttime map that show the hubs of the global economy 
and now many of you have been reading in the news how people are looking to china to lead the rebound the economic rebound not just in asia but potentially for the world 
so china is becoming the anchor of the economy in the region 
china has signed military agreements with many countries in the region 
all of this is happening without firing a shot 
so what can we do to think about borders differently in this part of the world 
what i want to present to you is what i call state building day by day 
the kurds for 3000 years have been waging a struggle for independence and now is their chance to finally have it 
now remember kurdistan is landlocked 
and therefore it has to have amicable relations with them 
the lesson from kurdistan and from palestine is that independence alone without infrastructure is futile 
the last time that was the case was actually a century ago during the ottoman empire 
but today the hejaz railway lies in tatters ruins 
more pipelines means more silk roads instead of the great game 
in 2004 15 new countries joined the eu 
even if these regions aren't part of the eu they are becoming part of its sphere of influence 
so what's next where are we going to see borders change and new countries born 
if we were to look at all of africa we could most certainly acknowledge far more tribal divisions and so forth 
it has three ongoing civil wars the genocide in darfur which you all know about the civil war in the east of the country and south sudan 
but if you look in nature you see that different kinds of animals can have really different lifespans 
now these animals are different from one another because they have different genes 
and we didn't study any of these animals 
is it miserable it doesn't seem to be 
and if you look at the tissues of the animal they're starting to deteriorate 
and now here is the daf-2 mutant 
but it's really more like this let's say you're a 30 year-old guy -- or in your 30s -- and you're a bachelor and you're dating people 
she says i'm 60 
well as you know genes which are part of the dna they're instructions to make a protein that does something 
it says that aging is subject to control by the genes and specifically by hormones 
so after we made our discoveries with little c elegans people who worked on other kinds of animals started asking if we made the same daf-2 mutation the hormone receptor mutation in other animals will they live longer 
they hardly get cancer and when they do it's not as severe 
so in a daf-2 mutant -- you see that i have the x drawn here through the receptor 
the receptor isn't working as well 
and many of these different genes we've shown actually contribute to the long lifespan of the daf-2 mutant 
then they promote the uptake of nutrients 
so he doesn't actually do anything himself 
we don't know the details of how this works but we do know then that foxo genes can impact the lifespan of people 
but in this case there's already a drug called rapamycin that binds to the tor protein and inhibits its activity 
so people take it to prevent organ transplants from being rejected 
you could change the genes in principle 
so it might be that you would just have to fine tune it very carefully to get the benefits without getting any problems 
i wasn't suggesting that i was going to go and do it but  
just move to one side for us if you would 
and when you look at these 70 year-old turtles you can't tell the difference just by looking between those turtles and 20 year-old turtles 
they're more resistant to these kinds of stresses 
they're not getting old in the dog's lifespan 
here's another good article about a new campaign opposing privatization of transit without any contact information for the campaign 
the message seems to be that the readers are most likely to want to eat maybe read a book maybe see a movie but not be engaged in their community 
they all have heroes who were chosen 
this helps me understand why a lot of people have trouble seeing themselves as leaders because it sends all the wrong messages about what leadership is about 
as long as we're teaching our kids that heroism starts when someone scratches a mark on your forehead or someone tells you that you're part of a prophecy they're missing the most important characteristic of leadership which is that it comes from within 
which leads us to the last one which is our elections 
so i was privileged to train in transplantation under two great surgical pioneers thomas starzl who performed the world's first successful liver transplant in 1967 and sir roy calne who performed the first liver transplant in the uk 
in the following year 
but not all patients on the transplant wait list are so fortunate 
and the gift of life has been extended from brain-dead donors to living related donors -- relatives who might donate an organ or a part of an organ like a split liver graft to a relative or loved one 
no doubt i was informed the consent had been obtained 
and at that time stem cell research had gained momentum following the isolation of the world's first human embryonic stem cells in the 1990s 
and as it turns out fat is one of the best sources of adult stem cells 
if this research is successful it may then reduce the need to research and sacrifice human embryos 
it is a fact that when our organs or tissues are injured our bone marrow releases stem cells into our circulation 
there are 170 clinical trials investigating the role of stem cells in heart disease 
we are very happy because we have the opportunity to have this angel in the world -- not only in our country venezuela but in our world 
he has given us the possibility to have dreams and to make true the dreams 
and here are the results of this wonderful project that is the system in venezuela 
he buys a ring she buys a dress 
these optimistic young bastards promise to honor and cherish each other through hot flashes and mid-life crises and a cumulative 50-lb weight gain until that far-off day when one of them is finally able to rest in peace 
and some of them will even still be enjoying each others' company when neither of them can chew solid food anymore 
what do the folks who make it all the way to side-by-side burial plots have in common 
and they try to pinpoint what it is that sets them apart from their miserable neighbors and friends 
it's obvious that this leads to marital bliss because women we care a great deal about being thin and good looking whereas men mostly care about sex  
so instead of all that laborious dieting and exercising we just need to wait for them to get fat maybe bake a few pies 
these are couples who can find good in any situation 
this is an actual study and let me clarify 
now i don't know how old all of you are but when i was a kid your parents took pictures with a special kind of camera that held something called film and by god film was expensive 
i'm serious 
so i'm obviously going to need fatten him up 
i have a doppelganger 
that's exactly what i do -- optical mind control 
even if we could measure what every cell is doing at all times we would still have to make sense of the recorded activity patterns and that's so difficult chances are we'll understand these patterns just as little as the brains that produce them 
to make progress we need to break the code 
the approach works so well that we can write purely artificial messages directly to the brain 
these headless bodies can live for about a day but they don't do much 
now for an intelligent being like our fly this policy is not written in stone but rather changes as the animal learns from experience 
so we bred flies whose brains were more or less randomly peppered with cells that were light addressable 
whenever it comes up to the midpoint it pauses it carefully scans the odor interface as if it was sniffing out its environment and then it turns around 
these 12 cells as shown here in green send the output to a brain structure called the mushroom body which is shown here in gray 
if the connection is strong the motors will turn on and the fly will initiate a turn 
in a situation like this we would expect the critic to speak up and to tell the actor to change its policy 
so the next time the fly finds itself facing the same odor again the connection is strong enough to turn on the motors and to trigger an evasive maneuver 
now in terms of biomimetics as human technologies take on more of the characteristics of nature nature becomes a much more useful teacher 
now being a biologist i was very curious about this 
these are gecko toes 
and the individual has 2 billion of these nano-size split ends 
so what they did was they asked us an important question 
they're climbing up a wall or a tree 
now that's real time you can't see anything 
so they do it with this active tail as they swing around 
okay there it goes 
it oscillates its tail up and down like a dolphin 
but watch its front legs can you see what they are doing 
so now we were really confused because there are no reports of it gliding 
one of the problems is coming up with the right target 
there's not a lot of science behind that one either 
now why is this so complicated 
volcanoes eject aerosols into the atmosphere 
so here's the thing it sounds like a simple question 
that's the ross sea ice shelf on the right there 
you can go then and study corals and figure out how often do you see this 
and it been growing for about 600 years 
you can see some of the coral cores there on the right 
that the place where during an earthquake in 1954 this marine terrace was lifted up out of the ocean very quickly and it was lifted up about six to seven meters 
and so now you can walk through a coral reef without getting wet 
there's a whole family of curves here 
some of the records show lower temperatures than others 
and there is natural variability caused by the sun caused by el ninos 
there's consequences for carbonate organisms 
the main framework material of coral reefs is calcium carbonate 
and on coral reefs where some of the main framework organisms disappear we will see a major loss of marine biodiversity 
you know these are things that we have good physiological reasons to expect to see stressed caused by this transience 
you have to go back about 30 million years to find a time when co2 levels were double what they are today 
that's the reason that they're not able to respond or adapt to this rapid acidification that's going on right now 
and i think that may very well be true so i'll close with this 
and a long time ago -- well about 40 years ago -- my mom had an exchange student 
this is donna at the statue of liberty 
but i'd like to talk about another way to travel that doesn't require a ship or an airplane and just requires a movie camera a projector and a screen 
and that's what i'm going to talk to you about today 
so i'm the living product of two cultures coming together 
to change the arab nightmare into the american dream 
josh rushing the night they showed the pows and the dead soldiers -- al jazeera showed them -- it was powerful because america doesn't show those kinds of images 
and it upset me on a profound level that i wasn't bothered as much the night before 
jehane noujaim i was overwhelmed by the response of the film for we didn't know whether it would be able to get out there 
and i saw this with audiences 
man god forbid 
if you were not abu azzam's daughter  
in this life we're dead anyway 
woman perhaps we have to turn it into a moral war 
zvika i said ok that's bat-chen that's my daughter 
are you sure she is dead 
when we got to here we saw three israeli military jeeps parked on the side of the road 
george but there is a teacher that is in charge 
but after thinking logically about it i didn't find any reason why not to meet them and let them know of our suffering 
we see that there are palestinians who suffered a lot who lost children and still believe in the peace process and in reconciliation 
yes yes 
but i've been trying to think about ways to give power to these independent voices to give power to the filmmakers to give power to people who are trying to use film for change 
there's just vision that are working with palestinians and israelis who are working together for peace and documenting that process and getting interviews out there and using this film to take to congress to show that it's a powerful tool to show that this is a woman who's had her daughter killed in an attack and she believes that there are peaceful ways to solve this 
there's working films and there's current tv which is an incredible platform for people around the world to be able to put their -- yes it's amazing 
there are people that want to be a part of this global day of film to be able to provide a platform for independent voices and independent films to get out there 
in the year 1919 a virtually unknown german mathematician named theodor kaluza suggested a very bold and in some ways a very bizarre idea 
that is in addition to left right back forth and up down kaluza proposed that there might be additional dimensions of space that for some reason we don't yet see 
how is it that the sun 93 million miles away [that] somehow it affects the motion of the earth 
he like einstein was in search of what we call a unified theory 
maybe i can play the same game with the other known force which was at that time known as the electromagnetic force -- we know of others today but at that time that was the only other one people were thinking about 
now but for those of us who are a little bit more practically minded two questions immediately arise from his observation 
it's very hard to see it though from far away 
so many people worked on it but by the '40s certainly by the '50s this strange but very compelling idea of how to unify the laws of physics had gone away 
in our era a new approach to unify the laws of physics is being pursued by physicists such as myself many others around the world it's called superstring theory as you were indicating 
and there you see unification because matter particles electrons and quarks radiation particles photons gravitons are all built up from one entity 
one of the other predictions of string theory -- no that's not one of the other predictions of string theory 
and that question is this when we look around the world as scientists have done for the last hundred years there appear to be about 20 numbers that really describe our universe 
not yet 
but we believe the answer for why those numbers have the values they do may rely on the form of the extra dimensions 
this is an example of something known as a calabi-yau shape -- name isn't all that important 
but as you can see the extra dimensions fold in on themselves and intertwine in a very interesting shape interesting structure 
and the idea is that if this is what the extra dimensions look like then the microscopic landscape of our universe all around us would look like this on the tiniest of scales 
and this is an experiment that may test for them in our lifetime 
and yet even at this most fundamental level context is everything 
and now you see it 
there is no a priori reason why an h has to go between that w and a 
so you don't do it again 
your brain is learning and it's learning that the right side of its visual field is under red illumination the left side of its visual field is under green illumination 
i take it from your response they don't look the same anymore right 
why because if the tile in that shadow were in fact in shadow and reflecting the same amount of light to your eye as the one outside the shadow it would have to be more reflective -- just the laws of physics 
which means we can bring all this information together to create some incredibly strong illusions 
and they land on the flower they stick their tongue in there called a proboscis and they drink sugar water 
so they are using the relationships between the colors to solve the puzzle which is exactly what we do 
so illusions are often used especially in art in the words of a more contemporary artist to demonstrate the fragility of our senses 
instead color tells us something completely different that the brain didn't actually evolve to see the world the way it is 
we can't instead the brain evolved to see the world the way it was useful to see in the past 
well one of the ways we do in my lab and studio is we translate the light into sound and we enable people to hear their visual world 
so working with kids they created images thinking about what might the images you see sound like if we could listen to them 
so now what i want to do i'm going to put the middle nine surfaces here under yellow illumination by simply putting a filter behind them 
the question is is that an illusion 
and they're different 
and you can make your own decision and then you'll decide whether the invasion was worth it 
that's how you think about security -- in terms of the trade-off 
i'll give you the short answer 
now most of the time that works 
we've developed this ability because it makes evolutionary sense 
the unknown is perceived to be riskier than the familiar 
if you hear a lot about tiger attacks there must be a lot of tigers around 
when something is so common it's no longer news -- car crashes domestic violence -- those are the risks you worry about 
there's no real word for stuff that makes us secure but doesn't make us feel secure 
and there are two ways to do this 
enough real world examples helps 
security theater's exposed when it's obvious that it's not working properly 
if for example terrorism almost never happens it's really hard to judge the efficacy of counter-terrorist measures 
it doesn't change it's real 
we couldn't have a germ theory of disease before we invented the microscope to see them 
where do we get these models we get them from others 
think of models of terrorism child kidnapping airline safety car safety 
models can come from industry 
for us we're very facile around electricity 
now it had a name which made it scarier than the regular flu even though it was more deadly 
as the novelty wore off the months went by there was some amount of tolerance people got used to it 
we have feeling model reality 
new models that extend long periods of time are hard 
global warming is a great example 
strong feelings can create a model 
and that's okay 
now what we want is people to get familiar enough with better models -- have it reflected in their feelings -- to allow them to make security trade-offs 
remember i said feeling model reality i said reality doesn't change it actually does 
someone else bought it and died 
all human life all life depends on plants 
and plants sometimes find it rather difficult to move because there might be cities and other things in the way 
so if all human life depends on plants doesn't it make sense that perhaps we should try to save them 
all the genetic information for future generations of plants are held in seeds 
so all around the world people are doing the same thing 
this is at least 100 times bigger 
how much does it cost 
the future research is how can we find the genetic and molecular markers for the viability of seeds without having to plant them every 10 years 
and it was found close to here stanford 
some lasted 14-and-a-half minutes 
couldn't do it could not wait 
put it back 
they would walk around they would play with their skirts and pants 
the sales person that -- the customer says i want that and the person says okay here you are 
then you sell a lot more 
the rules of engagement how to talk when to talk and how to deal with them 
we just have to persevere 
everybody seems to agree with that 
but now as we prepare to talk we understand how little we know 
should we talk to hamas 
now my diplomats are instructed to talk to all these groups 
but talking can be done in different ways 
we make a distinction between talking from a diplomatic level and talking at the political level 
in his memoirs long road to freedom he wrote that he survived during those years of captivity because he always decided to look upon his oppressor as also being a human being also being a human being 
now south african friends will know that was very painful 
dialogue is not easy -- not between individuals not between groups not between governments -- but it is very necessary 
but that strategy seldom takes you very far 
we could never have done the convention against anti-personnel landmines and the convention that is banning cluster munitions unless we had done diplomacy differently by engaging with civil society 
how are we going to solve climate change through negotiations unless we are able to make civil society and people not part of the problem but part of the solution 
what is the legitimacy of diplomacy of the the solution we devise as diplomats if they cannot be reflected and understood by also these broader forces of societies that we now very loosely call groups 
the diplomatic toolbox is actually full of different tools we can use to strengthen our communication 
in my country i have seen how the council of islamist groups and christian groups came together not as a government initiative but they came together on their own initiative to establish contact and dialogue in times where things were pretty low-key tension 
how are we going to settle and build a bigger we to deal with our issues if we don't improve our skills of communication 
so i'm in chile in the atacama desert sitting in a hotel lobby because that's the only place that i can get a wi-fi connection and i have this picture up on my screen and a woman comes up behind me 
and you know excuse me 
this is a gentoo penguin and she was still skeptical 
so one of the things that i love to do is travel around the world and look at archaeological sites 
and one thing that isn't a mystery actually was when i grew up -- because when i was a little kid i'd seen these pictures -- and i thought well why that look on the face 
in fact in many of the statues when you excavate them the backs are totally smooth -- almost glass smooth 
we're trying to get all of the permissions to get everything all set to get it going 
in this case we're working with a major medical foundation to develop inexpensive ways of diagnosing diseases in developing countries 
various parts of the world will have a cult food that people get enormously attached to -- there's tremendous traditions there's secrecy 
and i'm trying to use a very scientific approach 
so i do a lot of work on dinosaurs 
not the same one actually this is a cast which i had bought and then after buying the cast i found my own and i don't have room for two 
it's something that can inform all sorts of science in unexpected ways 
these days bits are cheap unfortunately that means you've got to spend more time sorting through them 
then a little bit later i start getting some pictures like this 
that's kind of what it's like 
and you know when i was at microsoft that was so engrossing and the whole industry was expanding so much that it did tend to crowd out most of the other things in my life 
the sound made flicking a wall switch off is of a completely different nature 
or the recorded crowing of a rooster 
that's the end of that 
take-out sandwich shops film processing drop-offs peep-shows and necktie stores 
you were late for school again this morning 
we have fading memories of that provisional temple erected each time an adult sat down 
the next story is called the haverpiece collection a nondescript warehouse visible for a moment from the northbound lanes of the prykushko expressway serves as the temporary resting place for the haverpiece collection of european dried fruit 
do you remember wandering as a child through those dark wooden storefront galleries 
a shoe made of apricot leather for the daughter of a czar 
and that this in fact will be the way that we treat cancer in the future 
it is very useful in certain circumstances 
it's the one theory that the biologists ever really got right 
you predict a black hole and you look out the telescope and there it is just like you said 
and so we can discover things that probably you could have found by looking at enough of your relatives but they may be surprising 
and applied minds gets a lot of calls from people who want help with their problems and i didn't think this was a very likely one to call back so i kept on giving him to the delay list 
and i'll show you what that protein measurement looks like 
we sort out the proteins -- from left to right is the weight of the fragments that we're getting and from top to bottom is how slippery they are 
and you can see how the lines occur in these little groups of bump bump bump bump bump 
and many people in this audience probably wouldn't be alive if doctors didn't do this 
well it's in the kitchen oh you must have kitchen water 
so your house is dealing with leaks all the time but it's fixing them it's draining them out and so on 
and so i gave this talk and said why don't you guys do this 
but design a program of treatments specifically for you and help your body guide back to health -- guide your body back to health 
so thank you very much 
now i want to tell you a quick story 
super bowl i heard it over here it was the date of the super bowl 
and there were even some polls that were saying she was going to go all the way 
but when we talked to people it appeared that a funnel effect had happened in these tribes all across the united states 
but not just work it's within these tribes that societies get built that important things happen 
if you focus in on a group like this -- this happens to be a usc game -- and you zoom in with one of those super satellite cameras and do magnification factors so you could see individual people you would in fact see not a single crowd just like there is not a single crowd here but you would see these tribes that are then coming together 
not all tribes are the same and what makes the difference is the culture 
this is the kid who shot up virginia tech 
so this other book that steve mentioned that just came out called the three laws of performance my colleague steve zaffron and i argue that as people see the world so they behave 
well if people see the world in such a way that life sucks then their behavior will follow automatically from that 
now my birthday is coming up shortly and my driver's license expires 
the amount of world-changing behavior that would happen 
a whole group of people communicating that way talking that way 
now we find these in places where really smart successful people show up 
it was not christmas time there was a christmas tree 
there is in fact another stage 
there was no road map no one had ever done anything like this before 
and people at the time feared that south africa would end up going the way that rwanda has gone descending into one skirmish after another in a civil war that seems to have no end 
what about martin luther king 
in fact martin luther king's most famous line was at stage three 
48 percent of working tribes say these are employed tribes say i'm great and you're not 
but you don't leave them where you found them okay 
i don't know anybody 
we move people from stage one to stage two by getting them in a new tribe and then over time getting them connected 
but we're not done yet because then how do we go from stage four which is great to stage five 
incidentally they did pull it off 
and they released the first-ever world poll 
we're here to celebrate compassion 
but kindness is an everyday byproduct of all the great virtues 
and in that light for the religious compassion also brings us into the territory of mystery -- encouraging us not just to see beauty but perhaps also to look for the face of god in the moment of suffering in the face of a stranger in the face of the vibrant religious other 
the communities that jean vanier founded like jean vanier himself exude tenderness 
and compassion can also have those qualities 
and compassion is unleashed in wider and wider circles by signs and stories never by statistics and strategies 
rachel naomi remen says this is an important and empowering story for our time because this story insists that each and every one of us frail and flawed as we may be inadequate as we may feel has exactly what's needed to help repair the part of the world that we can see and touch 
this is going to change science i believe and it will change religion 
einstein believed deeply that science should transcend national and ethnic divisions 
but he watched physicists and chemists become the purveyors of weapons of mass destruction in the early 20th century 
so in this photograph you see a mind looking out a window at what might be a cathedral -- it's not 
thank you 
camp was more like a keg party without any alcohol 
and it went like this r-o-w-d-i-e that's the way we spell rowdie 
and i just waited for the time that i could go off and read my books 
and i was always going off to crowded bars when i really would have preferred to just have a nice dinner with friends 
so even if you're an extrovert yourself i'm talking about your coworkers and your spouses and your children and the person sitting next to you right now -- all of them subject to this bias that is pretty deep and real in our society 
shyness is about fear of social judgment 
so the key then to maximizing our talents is for us all to put ourselves in the zone of stimulation that is right for us 
and also we have this belief system right now that i call the new groupthink which holds that all creativity and all productivity comes from a very oddly gregarious place 
and the vast majority of teachers reports believing that the ideal student is an extrovert as opposed to an introvert even though introverts actually get better grades and are more knowledgeable according to research 
now i think at this point it's important for me to say that i actually love extroverts 
the same religions who send their sages off to lonely mountain tops also teach us love and trust 
here's margaret atwood cat's eye 
but here's the thing about my grandfather 
it was my version of my grandfather's hours of the day alone in his library 
and i call this my year of speaking dangerously 
but we need much more privacy and much more freedom and much more autonomy at work 
we need to be teaching kids to work together for sure but we also need to be teaching them how to work on their own 
and that's okay 
then about the initiative that chris mentioned that we decided to launch at amd that we call 50x15 
he explained to me about johann strauss and how he created the waltzes that became so famous in the world 
that's year by year this comes from our friends at gapmindercom 
so we talked about ways in which perhaps one could partner to be able to bring the cost of this technology down 
and frankly -- and i know that sometimes i offend some of my customers when i say this but i truly mean it -- if you could take the name of the computer off the top of it it would be very difficult to judge who made it because they're all highly commoditized but they're all different 
and the last piece which is really important -- and this is an opinion that we have not shared by many this is one where we seem to stand alone on this one -- is that we really believe that the greatest success of this initiative can come by fostering local integrated end-to-end ecosystems 
we just recently opened a learning laboratory in a school in the west cape in south africa in a school that's called nelson mandela school and when you see the faces and activities of these children being able to access computers it's just phenomenal 
and we're really thrilled about the opportunity to be part of this and can't wait to see what comes out of this exciting exciting activity 
i'll tell you that one of the things that i feel is really critical for us in industry in business is to be able to be passionate about solving these problems 
i was eager to go off to college and go find girls and study and girls and study but then i finished college and i fell in love 
and on my wedding day my father came to me again and said you know i'm going to remind you again that each generation has to do better than the last one 
just existing 
i really think that's there's this inner desire 
and all of a sudden it brought a lot of money and a lot of attention 
that's kind of a no-brainer 
so what is it for 
so i believe essentially that leadership is stewardship 
this is not my planet it wasn't mine before i was born 
do you think we have a stewardship here to take the environment seriously 
what we believe obviously -- and you know this -- determines our behavior and our behavior determines what we become in life 
my wife and i first made five decisions on what to do with the money 
we just said we're not going to use it on us 
believe me there's a whole lot easier ways to make money 
the last thing we did is we became what i call reverse tithers 
and that is when my wife and i got married 30 years ago we started tithing 
materialism is all about getting -- get get get get all you can can all you get sit on the can and spoil the rest 
and we think that the good life is actually looking good -- that's most important of all -- looking good feeling good and having the goods 
there's a chapter in the bible called psalm 72 and it's solomon's prayer for more influence 
basically he's talking about all the marginalized in society 
it's a shepherd's staff 
and by the way my god doesn't have to show up on cheese bread 
you know if god's going to show up he's not going to show up on cheese bread 
but he doesn't do miracles just to show off 
what do you do with a shepherd's staff 
you pull them or you poke them one or the other 
and it represents your influence 
and that gives with you enormous influence 
what are you doing with what you've been given 
why would god wire you to do something and then not have you do it 
and in some countries -- let me pick afghanistan -- 75 percent of the little girls don't go to school 
so in the three years since i talked at ted and showed a prototype it's gone from an idea to a real laptop 
we have about a quarter of a million in transit to those and other children and then there are another quarter of a million more that are being ordered at this moment 
and that engine is going to see the results in 20 years 
they own the laptops they take them home 
and the reason she brought her mother is that this six-year-old child had been teaching her mother how to read and write 
so it's 1995 i'm in college and a friend and i go on a road trip from providence rhode island to portland oregon 
we get it in the abstract 
but the thing is the coyote runs off the cliff right after him 
that's when he falls 
this is not mine by the way 
we learn these really bad lessons really well 
when the vice president for health care quality at beth israel spoke about this incident he said something very interesting 
and yeah it is also why we get things wrong 
i just imagined it everywhere which has happened 
and the crypto-theme is 'i thought this one thing was going to happen and something else happened instead' and the thing is says ira glass we need this 
but you know our stories are like this because our lives are like this 
and something else happened instead 
because half the stuff that's the most mind-boggling and world-altering -- ted 1998 -- eh 
we come up with another idea 
bioenergy isn't global warming bioenergy is something which seems counterintuitive bioenergy is oil it's gas it's coal and part of building that bridge to the future to the point where we can actually see the oceans in a rational way or put up these geo-spatial orbits that will twirl or do microwaves or stuff is going to depend on how we understand bioenergy and manage it and to do that you really have to look first at agriculture 
maybe that's one of the reasons why if you fly over west texas the types of wells that you're beginning to see don't look unlike those pictures of kansas and those irrigated plots 
which is curious as we debate all this stuff but as you think of coal this is what burned wheat kernels look like not entirely unlike coal 
that is what bioenergy is it is not ethanol it is not subsidies to a few companies it is not importing corn into iowa because you've built so many of these ethanol plants it is beginning to understand the transition that occurred in agriculture from brute force into biological force and in the measure that you can do that you can clean some stuff and you can clean it pretty quickly 
but in the meantime for the next decade at least the name of the game is hydrocarbons and be that oil be that gas be that coal this is what we're dealing with and before i make this talk too long here's what's happening in the current energy system 
86 percent of the energy we consume are hydrocarbons that means 86 percent of the stuff we're consuming are probably processed plants and amoebas and the rest of the stuff and there's a role in here for conservation there's a role in here for alternative stuff but we've also got to get that other portion right 
and what gave her inspiration and meaning was the fact that she was taking care of people who were far away from home 
in the wake of the dotcom crash and 9/11 san francisco bay area hotels went through the largest percentage revenue drop in the history of american hotels 
and i initially ended up in the business section of the bookstore looking for a business solution 
each of us no matter what our role is in business has some hierarchy of needs in the workplace 
so as i started reading more maslow what i started to realize is that maslow later in his life wanted to take this hierarchy for the individual and apply it to the collective to organizations and specifically to business 
but as we started asking ourselves about how we were addressing the higher needs of our employees and our customers i realized we had no metrics 
so i went out and studied a bunch of things and i found a survey that showed that 94 percent of business leaders worldwide believe that the intangibles are important in their business things like intellectual property their corporate culture their brand loyalty and yet only five percent of those same leaders actually had a means of measuring the intangibles in their business 
and he's a very wise man and he said listen bhutan's goal is not to create happiness 
one of those key indicators is how do the bhutanese feel about how they spend their time each day 
or in other words i think the bhutanese believe happiness equals wanting what you have -- imagine gratitude -- divided by having what you want -- gratification 
so it suggests that the momentum is shifting 
as you look at these two columns here doesn't it make you feel like it's time for us to start figuring out a new way to count a new way to imagine what's important to us in life 
we're spending 10 billion dollars on the census 
we're asking 10 simple questions -- it is simplicity 
they're about demographics 
abe maslow said long ago something you've heard before but you didn't realize it was him 
he said if the only tool you have is a hammer everything starts to look like a nail 
in vivian's case her unit of production isn't the tangible hours she works it's the intangible difference she makes during that one hour of work 
he stayed there a hundred times in the last 20 years and he's loyal to the property because of the relationship that vivian and her fellow employees have created with him 
we don't have to choose between inspired employees and sizable profits we can have both 
at least as he wrote when a robot dies you don't have to write a letter to its mother 
the us is currently ahead in military robotics right now but we know that in technology there's no such thing as a permanent first move or advantage 
there's already a jihadi website that you can go on and remotely detonate an ied in iraq while sitting at your home computer 
soldiers have a name for these clips 
the typical one that i was sent was an email that had an attachment of video of a predator strike taking out an enemy site missile hits bodies burst into the air with the explosion 
it was set to music 
and so we kind of have this kind of moral feel-good moment 
that bottle winds up getting burned 
and so poor people who are making these products in petrochemical centers like cancer alley poor people who are consuming these products disproportionately and then poor people who even at the tail end of the recycling are having their lives shortened are all being harmed greatly by this addiction that we have to disposability 
now you think to yourself -- because i know how you are -- you say that sure is terrible for those poor people 
it's just awful those poor people 
i hope someone does something to help them 
but guess what 
we don't have disposable resources 
and as we all begin to come back to that basic understanding new opportunities for action begin to emerge 
but if we want to make something hard we come up i know i'm going to make a hard substance 
we just had this vote and everybody's like well not in our state 
just so proud 
but california though we lead the world in some of the green stuff we also unfortunately lead the world in some of the gulag stuff 
we have a moral challenge in this moment 
and really they fundamentally told you are you going to hug a tree or are you going to hug a child pick 
well when you start working on issues like plastic you realize that the whole thing is connected and luckily most of us are blessed to have two arms 
they'd worn themselves out beating themselves against the window and well they were easy to capture 
i've called this vehicle generically a volantor after the latin word volant meaning to fly in a light nimble manner 
volantor-like helicopter perhaps 
the press calls my particular volantor a skycar 
one could say that a helicopter does pretty much what the hummingbird does and gets around in much the same way and it's true but a helicopter is a very complex device 
because if you're in this world where computers are controlling what you're doing it's going to be very critical that something can't fail on you 
well you can't right now take off from your home because it's too noisy 
i mean to be able to take off from your home you'd have to be extremely quiet 
after all if you can fly like that why are you going to drive around on a highway 
you can play computer games you can sleep you can read on the way 
and then through the various years we invented various vehicles 
redundancy is the critical issue here 
if you want to stay alive you've got to have backups 
that's a very significant incentive for getting out of san francisco 
but you better be the first one out of town as the real estate values go to hell 
there's an interesting poll that came out recently under nas -- i think it's msnbc -- in which they asked the question are you in the market for a volantor 
i mean think about how much we love this 
think about that 
what dr soljacic figured out how to do was separate the coils in a transformer to a greater distance than the size of those transformers using this technology which is not dissimilar from the way an opera singer shatters a glass on the other side of the room 
and what i'm going to do is to show you pretty much what's here 
and if the demo gods are willing in about 10 seconds or so we should see it 
think about it you don't want those ugly cords coming down 
imagine if you can get rid of it 
and i'll do it again just for safety's sake 
we're an equal opportunity designer of this sort of thing 
it runs the android operating system 
so we put a little sleeve on the back but we should be able to get this guy to wake up too 
and think of what that would do for you 
and third our bodies are filters and storehouses for environmental toxins 
if you're cremated all those toxins i mentioned are released into the atmosphere 
so by trying to preserve our dead bodies we deny death poison the living and further harm the environment 
i realize this is not the kind of relationship that we usually aspire to have with our food 
the decompiculture society shares a vision of a cultural shift from our current culture of death denial and body preservation to one of decompiculture a radical acceptance of death and decomposition 
so the virtual earth initiative and other types of these initiatives are all about extending our current search metaphor 
well a little unknown secret is his brother actually works on the virtual earth team 
when we think about how all this comes together it's all about software algorithms and math 
we do this all through software algorithms and math -- a highly automated pipeline creating these cities 
but what we've found is they like the fluidity of the 3-d model 
i'm going to use these two countries to make an economic argument for democracy rather than against democracy 
look at the skyline of shanghai 
the picture on india is the dharavi slum of mumbai in india 
in an interview printed in the financial press of india he said that he wants to make mumbai another shanghai 
this is an oxford-trained economist steeped in humanistic values and yet he agrees with the high-pressure tactics of shanghai 
this is a very little known fact about the two countries 
the economy grows government accumulates more resources and the government can invest in infrastructure -- rather than infrastructure being a cause for economic growth 
one reason is the east asian model 
korea succeeded north korea didn't 
burma didn't succeed 
in china it's all women 
by looking at these two pictures i say no it won't overtake china for a while 
actually the answer is more nuanced and subtle than that 
indira gandhi declared emergency rule in 1975 
why do many people believe that india is still a growth disaster 
but china is a superstar in terms of economic growth 
this is the grand cafe here in oxford 
that's its great claim to fame and i wanted to show it to you not because i want to give you the kind of starbucks tour of historic england but rather because the english coffeehouse was crucial to the development and spread of one of the great intellectual flowerings of the last 500 years what we now call the enlightenment 
what are the environments that lead to unusual levels of innovation unusual levels of creativity 
and this is what they ended up coming with 
it's called a neonurture device 
in the inside it's all car parts 
it's got a fan it's got headlights for warmth it's got door chimes for alarm -- it runs off a car battery 
this is hogarth's famous painting of a kind of political dinner at a tavern but this is what the coffee shops looked like back then 
and one of the problems with this is that people are actually -- when you research this field -- people are notoriously unreliable when they actually kind of self-report on where they have their own good ideas or their history of their best ideas 
so when they were sitting in front of the microscope when they were talking to their colleague at the water cooler and all these things 
but that's a key thing 
and so they ask around to a couple of their colleagues and everybody's like no i hadn't thought of doing that 
and so guier and weiffenbach go back to weiffenbach's office and they start kind of noodling around -- hacking as we might call it now 
we should record it 
and they thought about it and they said well i guess maybe you could let's run the numbers here 
and i bet you one of you if not more has used said device and said satellite system to locate a nearby coffeehouse somewhere in the last --  in the last day or last week right 
chance favors the connected mind 
my story starts way before i was born 
they got on and didn't know where they were going and ended up in canada 
i was 14 and i emailed professors at the local university to see if maybe i could go work in their lab and hardly anyone responded 
and so i thought maybe if it can promote cell growth it can inhibit cell death too 
and so that's the project that i pursued for that year and it's continuing now as well and found that a specific purine derivative called guanidine had inhibited the cell growth by approximately 60 percent 
but i'd heard of cancer as the most feared disease of our time so how did the good and bad go together 
and while i was doing this i was reading the cancer literature trying to -- again -- familiarize myself with this new medical field 
and it was really interesting -- there were articles correlating if you have a bone fracture and then bone cancer arises 
it hasn't yet become fine-tuned enough to finish what has been initiated 
if we eliminate cancer the way we're trying to do now with chemotherapy and radiation we're bombarding the body or the cancer with toxins or with radiation trying to kill it 
we're removing the cancer cells but we're revealing the previous damage that the body has tried to fix 
so this really changed my view of looking at cancer 
and what metastases are is when the tumor -- when a piece -- breaks off and travels through the blood stream and goes to a different organ that's what a metastasis is 
but then again this fact that the metastases didn't go to skeletal muscle made that seem unlikely 
and i guess i'll keep investigating until i get the answers 
is it possible that muscle somehow intuitively knows that it needs this blood supply it needs to be constantly contracting so therefore it's almost selfish it's grabbing its blood vessels for itself 
and i hate to say that but it seems as though muscle cell possibly because of all its use has adapted faster than other body tissues to respond to injury to fine-tune this repair response and actually be able to finish the process which the body wants to finish i really believe that the human body is very very smart and we can't counteract something the body is saying to do 
and again some of these may be far-fetched but i figured if there's anywhere to present far-fetched ideas it's here at ted so thank you very much 
some of you have heard the story before but in fact there's somebody in the audience who's never heard this story -- in front of an audience -- before so i'm a little more nervous than i normally am telling this story 
and then my translator left 
they slept on the floor at night 
i had photographed as i said a lot of these kids 
again not at all shy or withdrawn or anything like the other children that i'd photographed 
it was very obvious from the very beginning that she was a leader 
and i said to my translator what's going on why is she crying 
and i said i'm 28 years old and i live in hotels and i'm not married 
and they had no idea about this request that she'd made of me 
so i finally found myung sung her best friend that she used to play with after school every day 
and i said to the translator what did he say 
and i said well tell him that i am a photographer 
i sort of had this picture of this incredibly wonderful bright happy little child who now appeared to be very withdrawn being enslaved by this family 
so i finally decided i said look -- this is all through the translator because this is all you know i don't speak a word of korean -- and i said look i'm really glad that hyun-sook has a family to live with 
i don't pretend to understand what's going on here 
well there was an american marine priest that i had met in the course of doing the story who had 75 children living in his house 
he had kids from all over korea living there and he would find families for these kids 
hyun-sook stayed at father keene's and her uncle agreed to let her stay there until the adoption went through 
and then she set up a work detail list of who cleaned the orphanage on what day 
we went back to our hotel room and gene was showing natasha also where atlanta was 
and we fall asleep -- and i've been in this room you know for a couple of months now 
and they always overheat the hotels in korea terribly so during the day i always left the window open 
and i don't speak korean but i'm hearing these voices and i'm not hearing anger i'm hearing terror 
i remember his son had the ll bean bootlaces and we're trying to do up his laces 
so we ran to the bathroom and got towels and put them over our faces and the kids faces 
eleven people ended up dying in the fire 
five people jumped and died other people were killed by the smoke 
so it turned into a dual celebration because natasha was the first person from this village ever to go to the united states 
this is saying goodbye to everybody at the orphanage 
and the pilot jeff cowley actually went back and adopted one of the other kids at the orphanage after meeting natasha 
so at this point natasha doesn't speak a word of english other than what little father keene taught her 
she learned english in three months 
natasha told me that a lot of the kids thought she was stuck up because they would talk to her and she wouldn't answer and they didn't realize she didn't actually speak english very well in the beginning 
now remember the picture how much she looked like her grandmother at the beginning 
the captain of the cheerleaders 
this is her half-sister 
natasha would you just come up for a second just maybe to say hello to everybody 
natasha i've seen pictures millions of times but today was the first time i'm actually seeing him give the whole presentation 
i started crying 
the telescope is actually built similarly to the well-known to you hubble space telescope except it does have an additional lens -- a wide-field lens as you would call it as a photographer 
the way we do that actually is with a method which we call the transit method 
but we learn a lot from that not only that there is a planet there but we also learn its size 
so what have we learned 
and we do care about planets like the earth because by now we understood that life as a chemical system really needs a smaller planet with water and with rocks and with a lot of complex chemistry to originate to emerge to survive 
so today i'm here to actually give you a first glimpse of what the new telescope kepler has been able to tell us in the last few weeks and lo and behold we are back to the harmony and to fulfilling the dreams of copernicus 
it's about 100 million such planets 
so that's great because then we can go and study them -- remotely of course -- with all the techniques that we already have tested in the past five years 
the one that this step is enabling us to do is coming next 
so the question is is that chemical phenomenon universal or is it something which depends on the planet 
we don't want to go blind because there's too many possibilities and there is not too much lab and there is not enough human time to actually to do all the experiments 
well there are many reasons and you heard some of them in the short talk today 
and that is going to change our worldview in a profound way -- not in a dissimilar way as 400 years ago copernicus' act did by changing the way we view space and time 
and half the time what's happened is it's related this kind of sense of insignificance to humankind to the earth in a bigger space 
i mean look you can see the necktie but you can't even imagine seeing the size of a little small atom 
so what does this tell us 
there is immense powerful potential in life in this universe -- especially now that we know that places like the earth are common 
let's start this new revolution at the tail end of the old one with synthetic biology being the way to transform both our environment and our future 
these gapminder bubbles show you how the spread of the virus was in 1983 in the world or how we estimate that it was 
look india got many infected but had a low level 
and almost the same happens here 
now let me make a fast replay of botswana 
and if people who are infected are treated they don't die of aids 
in spite of pepfar the generous pepfar all people are not reached by treatment and of those who are reached by treatment in the poor countries only 60 percent are left on treatment after two years 
no it's not look here 
there's a lot of things that we thought that now good research done by african institutions and researchers together with the international researchers show that that's not the case 
see the difference within one african country -- it goes from very low level to very high level and most of the provinces in kenya is quite modest 
so what is it then 
it could be concurrency 
and we have a terrible chlamydia epidemic -- terrible chlamydia epidemic which sticks around for many years 
let's talk about past and future billions 
we know that most of that wealth was made after the year 1800 
and notice most of that went to the motherland to the imperial metropoles not to their colonial possessions 
so i'm going to translate this into language that you can understand 
let me very briefly tell you what i mean by this synthesizing the work of many economic historians in the process 
that really was a killer application 
property rights it's not the democracy folks it's having the rule of law based on private property rights 
very few indians today wish that india had gone down mahatma gandhi's road 
finally the work ethic 
he was wrong 
take a look at mathematical attainment by 15 year-olds 
now it's just five times and soon it will be 25 times 
and could africa get that sequencing wrong 
one obvious implication of modern economic history is that it's quite hard to transition to democracy before you've established secure private property rights 
warning that may not work 
that's the basis for the western model of representative government 
and i think these words really nail it it means a society based upon the opinion of civilians 
that's not the way history works 
that's one of the most profound insights to come out of the historical study of complex institutions like civilizations 
what's your view on that 
niall ferguson well i really am not just talking about the rise of the east i'm talking about the rise of the rest and that includes south america 
i once asked one of my colleagues at harvard hey is south america part of the west 
spiders are not just everywhere but they're extremely diverse 
spiders are also extremely old 
even fossil spiders can make silk as we can see from this impression of a spinneret on this fossil spider 
so this means that both spiders and spider silk have been around for 380 million years 
you can see multiple fibers coming out of the spinnerets because each spinneret has many spigots on it 
in an orb-web-weaving spider you can find seven types of silk glands and what i have depicted here in this picture let's start at the one o'clock position there's tubuliform silk glands which are used to make the outer silk of an egg sac 
so silk fibers vary in their strength and also their extensibility 
if it wasn't able to stretch so much then basically when an insect hit the web it would just trampoline right off of it 
some of them are orb-weaving spiders and some of them are non-orb-weaving spiders 
how do groups get anything done right 
how do you organize a group of individuals so that the output of the group is something coherent and of lasting value instead of just being chaos 
and a coordination cost is essentially all of the financial or institutional difficulties in arranging group output 
more recently because the cost of letting groups communicate with each other has fallen through the floor -- and communication costs are one of the big inputs to coordination -- there has been a second answer which is to put the cooperation into the infrastructure to design systems that coordinate the output of the group as a by-product of the operating of the system without regard to institutional models 
and what i want to call your attention to is not the mermaid parade itself charming though it is but rather to these photos 
first of all when you form an institution you take on a management problem right 
you have to have legal structure 
third forming an institution is inherently exclusionary 
you can't hire everyone in a company right 
when you build cooperation into the infrastructure which is the flickr answer you can leave the people where they are and you take the problem to the individuals rather than moving the individuals to the problem 
in bigger systems the head gets bigger and the tail gets longer so the imbalance increases 
if you go down to five percent you're still accounting for 60 percent of the photos 
we've looked at who's contributed to linux and most of the patches have been produced by programmers who've only done one thing right 
do you want that patch right 
meetup a service founded so that users could find people in their local area who share their interests and affinities and actually have a real-world meeting offline in a cafe or a pub or what have you 
stay-at-home moms right 
it is a one-button operation that you can do for free 
and the answer to that question is it doesn't matter because that's not the right question 
and if there is an answer to that that happens outside the professional framework of journalism it makes no sense to take a professional metaphor and apply it to this distributed class 
they trade tips like if you feel like eating something clean a toilet or the litter box the feeling will pass 
we have an attitude that support groups are inherently beneficial 
now when the larger group is a bunch of drunks and the small group wants to stay sober then we think that's a great support group 
but when the small group is teenage girls who want to stay anorexic by choice then we're horrified 
flavor is king flavor rules 
so this is the challenge for this bread 
and this is what every student has to begin with 
everyone who works in the culinary world knows that the first stage of cooking is mise en place which is just a french way of saying get organized 
everything in its place first stage 
stage two is mixing we take the ingredients and we mix them 
and so we in the mixing process have to develop the gluten we have to activate the leaven or the yeast and we have to essentially distribute all the ingredients evenly 
and at stage nine we get the dough to the final shape and it goes into the oven -- stage 10 
and the starches when they reach about 180 degrees gelatinize 
and stage 11 we call it cooling -- because we never really eat the bread right away 
and we save some of those for the next generation 
so we turn it into flour 
not like hot water made cold or cold water turned hot but water boiled off and becoming steam 
so we've got now this flour 
and what do we do we add some water 
or another analogy would be a caterpillar has been turned into a butterfly 
but we've got this bread and what i did here is to try to again evoke even more flavor from this grain was we've added into it the spent grain from beer-making 
and so this is again hopefully not only a healthy bread but a bread that you will enjoy 
so if i kind of break this bread maybe we can share this now a little bit here 
we'll start a little piece here and i'm going to take a little piece here -- i think i'd better taste it myself before you have it at lunch 
let me give you just one example of this 
now the question is how could we ask them 
but half the time what she would do is take a little bit of the broccoli and go mmmmm broccoli 
so she'd act as if what she wanted was just the opposite of what the babies wanted 
the question you might ask though is why do children learn so much 
well what kind of explanation could we have for this 
and essentially what bayes did was to provide a mathematical way using probability theory to characterize describe the way that scientists find out about the world 
and some 10 years ago i suggested that babies might be doing the same thing 
because if you wave a block over the top of the detector something you wouldn't ever think of to begin with the detector will actually activate two out of three times 
now there are two things that are really interesting about this 
the first one is again remember these are four year-olds 
they're just learning how to count 
and there's been a bunch of interesting studies recently that have shown this playing around is really a kind of experimental research program 
i don't know 
not working either 
i think babies and children are actually more conscious than we are as adults 
it's good to be a grownup 
that technology is simulating humans 
and what you can see is -- it is actually a very good game 
i've made him run into a wall here over and over again 
so we simulated that as well and then the really tricky bit is to teach that network how to walk 
we heard about those already yesterday and i suppose that most of you are familiar with that already 
those are then selected by the algorithm reproduced with mutation and recombinations to introduce sex as well 
now this might look kind of trivial but it's actually very important because this is not something you get at the moment in any interactive or any virtual worlds 
so that's what you see here 
we just took this character that i just talked about put it on a slippery surface and this is what you get out of it 
so that you don't have a character that looks limp but actually a character that you can use in an action film straight away that looks kind of alive in midair as well 
that's one angle here's another angle 
so this is exactly the same behavior that you saw but in a slightly better rendered version 
this is incredibly quick this is happening in real time 
this is another behavior they requested 
you feel kind of sorry for the guy 
it's even worse -- and that is another video i just got last night -- if you render that a bit more realistically 
yes you can just about see it here 
now we've just tried and -- looked at our character and asked ourselves can we do that ourselves as well 
this was an ai contour that was produced and evolved -- half-evolved i should say -- to produce balance basically 
so that all happened automatically we didn't put that in there 
thanks 
you can draw as everyone should 
shake it and you have a heterosexual couple 
you know i'm making a very important argument 
i'm making an argument that art and creativity are very essential tools in empathy 
say your motorcycle crashes 
ok when i was offered the times column six years ago the deal was like this you'll be sent the coolest hottest slickest new gadgets 
every week it'll arrive at your door 
the job though came with one small downside and that is they intended to publish my email address at the end of every column 
the guy had a duplicate headset for me to listen to 
some of the stories are just so classic and yet so understandable 
and the technician's like ma'am you've got the mouse up against the screen 
and we've arrived at the age of interface matrices where there are so many features and options you have to do two dimensions you know a vertical and a horizontal you guys all complained about how microsoft word is always bulleting your lists and underlining your links automatically 
it's not like the rest of the screen is so full of other components that you need to collapse the choices 
so there is a limit that we don't want to cross so what is the answer 
i'm sorry it's not one yet 
you have to scroll like seven screens-full to get to it 
it's like a 747 shuttle cockpit 
you do not 
we've entered planet domination mode 
they're dying to throw the whole thing out and start fresh but they can't they're locked in because so many add-ons and other company stuff locks into the old 1982 chassis 
i liked the media center pc i liked the microsoft spot watch 
the lesson was simplicity sells 
here's another example chris you're the source of all power 
in my very last example -- i do a lot of my work using speech recognition software and you have to be kind of quiet because the software is nervous 
i also use this feature called voice macros period 
correct dissuade not just 
no new features it's never happened before in software 
it could be the design of the thing you're using 
but i also in looking at more powerful technologies and nanotechnology and genetic engineering and other new emerging kind of digital technologies became very concerned about the potential for abuse 
and we can't fight the threat in the kind of stupid way we're doing because a million-dollar act causes a billion dollars of damage causes a trillion dollar response which is largely ineffective and arguably probably almost certainly has made the problem worse 
so after giving up on the book -- and i had the great honor to be able to join kleiner perkins about a year ago and to work through venture capital on the innovative side and to try to find some innovations that could address what i saw as some of these big problems 
things where you know a factor of 10 difference can make a factor of 1000 difference in the outcome 
the first is this whole area of education and it really relates to what nicholas was talking about with a $100 computer 
i think the challenge for us is -- i'm very certain that that will happen the challenge is will we develop the kind of educational tools and things with the net to let us take advantage of that device 
i'd argue today that we have incredibly powerful computers but we don't have very good software for them 
so given that we know and should believe -- because moore's law's been like a constant i mean it's just been very predictable progress over the last 40 years or whatever 
we have a challenge because the urban population is growing in this century from two billion to six billion in a very short amount of time people are moving to the cities 
and these are the kinds of things we're going to discover as we start to engineer at the nano scale 
we believe that genentech the compaq the lotus the sun the netscape the amazon the google in these fields are yet to be found because this materials revolution will drive these things forward 
and to give you an idea of the last fund that kleiner raised was a $400 million fund so this for us is a very substantial fund 
and what we did over the last few months -- well a few months ago ray kurzweil and i wrote an op-ed in the new york times about how publishing the 1918 genome was very dangerous 
you normally get a trivalent vaccine against three possible strains 
we believe that if we could fill these 10 gaps we have a chance to help really reduce the risk of a pandemic 
so we're very excited because we think we can fund 10 or speed up 10 projects and see them come to market in the next couple years that will address this 
but above all what we have to do is we have to help the good guys the people on the defensive side have an advantage over the people who want to abuse things 
many of them are trying to kill us from the minute we go into them but nevertheless they're absolutely gripping and contain unbelievable biological wonders that are very very different from those that we have on the planet 
apart from the intrinsic value of the biology and mineralogy and geo-microbiology that we do there we're also using these as templates for figuring out how to go look for life on other planets 
particularly mars but also europa the small icy moon around jupiter 
we're getting ready to begin to go through the process of leaving our planet of origin and out into the wider solar system and beyond 
i think myself that life is a natural outgrowth of the increasing complexification of matter over time 
it's going to be everywhere we look -- where there are planetary systems that can possibly support it 
so this is a very bold statement 
how do you know it when you find it 
very critically how do we protect it if we find it and not contaminate it 
if i were to take a swab off your teeth and plate it on a petri plate within about four or five hours i would have to see growth 
so they are intrinsically a slower life-form 
it's a very simple trick and i never fail to do it when i'm sitting in a window seat 
this is regularly several hundred parts per million 
and these are mineral deposits that are also made by bacteria 
and so one can send a thousand of them as you can see in this upper left-hand picture a thousand of them could fit into the payload bay that was used for one of the current mer rovers 
the question as to whether there is life on mars that is related to life on earth has now been very muddied because we now know from mars meteorites that have made it to earth that there's material that can be exchanged between those two planets 
one of the burning questions of course is if we go there and find life in the sub-surface as i fully expect that we will is that a second genesis of life 
did it start there and get transported here 
this will be a fascinating puzzle as we go into the next half-century and where i expect that we will have more and more mars missions to answer these questions 
for real -- you can take a second you've got to feel this to learn it 
well you could resist the temptation to announce your goal 
he wouldn't reveal the exact number of bottles he would not reveal exactly where the building was and he would not reveal exactly who owned the building 
and he ended up spending over a million dollars and hiring ex-fbi and ex-scotland yard agents to try to get to the bottom of this 
there are very few places in the us where you can try real kobe and one of them is wolfgang puck's restaurant cut in los angeles 
it was like 160 dollars for this 
and then i was left with these little ugly flakes on my pasta that you know their purpose had been served and so i'm afraid to say that this was also a disappointment to me 
this is soap that's made from silver nanoparticles which have antibacterial properties 
and it you know tickled a little bit and it smelled good but i have to say that nobody here has complimented me on the cleanliness of my face today 
these ones gq did spring for -- i own these -- but i will tell you not only did i not get a compliment from any of you i have not gotten a compliment from anybody in the months that i have owned and worn these 
and then an enzyme in its digestive tract leeches into the beans and people with the unenviable job of collecting these cats' leavings then go through the forest collecting the you know results and processing it into coffee -- although you actually can buy it in the unprocessed form 
but anyway we had a great night's sleep 
and you spend a third of your life in bed 
this is tom cruise arriving at the mission impossible iii premiere 
when he tries to open the door you could call it mission impossible iv 
there was one object that i could not get my hands on and that was the 1947 cheval blanc 
and it was an invitation you do not refuse 
earlier this year a virtual asteroid in it sold for 330000 real dollars 
and this is a titan class ship in the space game eve online 
it gives you great powers 
your ambition is satisfied but it's very beautiful 
and so these combine to form a very intense emotional engagement 
but this isn't the really interesting stuff 
the really interesting stuff about virtuality is what you can measure with it 
the game's just trying to get people to open about a million boxes getting better and better stuff in them 
this sounds immensely boring but games are able to make this process incredibly compelling 
but we don't just have pies in the boxes 
and also we say well how many monsters should i have the entire world full of a billion monsters 
they're not rational about probability 
it's not giving me my last two pies i'm going to give up 
and the point is really that we evolved to be satisfied by the world in particular ways 
so you give people lots and lots of different tasks 
third you reward effort 
and something very exciting is just beginning to happen in places like the university of bristol in the uk where we are beginning to be able to model mathematically dopamine levels in the brain 
and the success rate is at close to 100 percent 
let's start with business 
but each bag we'd sell would provide a year's worth of school meals for one kid 
all this time you're -- when you think about hunger it's a hard thing to think about because what we think about is eating 
there's definitely hunger in america 49 million people and almost 167 million children 
hunger definitely means something a little bit different in america than it does internationally but it's incredibly important to address hunger in our own country 
well they're both about food 
and you know the reality is that between farmers in america who actually quite frankly when i spend time in the midwest are pretty large in general 
so the problematic food system is affecting both hunger and obesity 
not to beat a dead horse but this is a global food system where there's a billion people hungry and billion people obese 
and how are we going to get those kids those nutritious foods 
another thing that's become incredibly global is production of meat and fish 
and we were going to do something that was horrible for the profession 
and that the incredible amount of effort to deliver those sketches for years and years and years is not only something to be derided but we would merely write it off as merely execution 
now there are all kinds of things that we architects need to learn how to do like managing contracts learning how to write contracts understanding procurement processes understanding the time value of money and cost estimation 
take joint positions with your client 
why was this horrible little building so important to their renown and their innovation 
because they could do whatever they wanted to to this building 
the architectural manifestation was frankly just dumb 
in fact it really was the clients who had to do it 
they had to make a decision based on the positions we took to redefine the budget being from two thirds capital-a architecture and one-third infrastructure to actually the inverse two-thirds infrastructure and one-third capital-a architecture 
now that theater machine has ability to move between a whole series of configurations at the push of a button and a few stagehands in a short amount of time 
but it also has the potential to not only provide multiform but multi-processional sequences 
and some of the seats need to actually change their direction and change their rake to allow that to happen 
there you see it's the side balconies for the proscenium 
meaning nothing that we do can we be the first ones to do it 
now if i'll take you through -- this is an early concept sketch -- take you through kind of a mixture of all these things together 
you would be allowed to bring objects or performers into the performing chamber aida their elephants you can bring the elephants in 
et voila 
this is the at&ampt performing arts center's dee and charles wyly theater 
but we got to that conclusion without understanding where we were going what we knew were a series of issues that the company and the client was confronted with 
so this is a picture of me holding one of the first watercolor paintings i ever made 
i have many of these books and i've been keeping them for about the last eight or nine years 
and i really loved this idea of the partial glimpse into somebody's life 
as opposed to knowing the whole story just knowing a little bit of the story and then letting your own mind fill in the rest 
this is a project that scans the world's newly posted blog entries every two or three minutes searching for occurrences of the phrases i feel and i am feeling and when it finds one of those phrases it grabs the full sentence up to the period and also tries to identify demographic information about the author 
and when that happens these montage compositions are automatically created which consist of the sentence and images being combined 
i'm 23 and a recovering meth and heroin addict and feel absolutely blessed to still be alive 
i feel sassy 
as you can see we feel fine collects very very small-scale personal stories 
so really even challenging the notion of what can be considered a story 
and the eskimo community basically camps out on the edge of the ice here waits for a whale to come close enough to attack and when it does it throws a harpoon at it and then hauls the whale up under the ice and cuts it up 
they have colors what do they look like 
this is in the patkotak's family living room in their house in barrow the boxed wine they served us 
cigarette break outside -- i don't smoke 
so you have some really happy person holding 10 balloons and some really sad soul holding one balloon 
a 16-year-old student 
i asked her about that and she said she meant that she doesn't want to be married because in her opinion when you get married in bhutan as a woman your chances to live an independent life kind of end and so she had no interest in that 
a 37-year-old road worker 
his wish was to make some money and open a store 
finally this is a 26-year-old nun i spoke to 
i asked her a little bit more about the cave and what she planned would happen once she went there you know 
jonathan harris maybe you'll die woman yes 
yeah but -- yeah ok do you hope -- would you prefer to live in the cave for 40 years or to live for one year 
woman yes from then i'm going to the heaven 
you can start to see some familiar balloons here 
thank you 
so the approach that we took was the other way around 
what you see here is a prototypic device 
it's made of paper and paper of course wicks fluid as you know paper cloth -- drop wine on the tablecloth and the wine wicks all over everything 
so the production capability is there 
and the procedure that we have is simply to start with paper 
you can't manipulate it very well although i'll show something about that in a moment 
so you take the drop of blood no further manipulations you put it on a little device the device filters out the blood cells lets the serum go through and you get a series of colors down in the bottom there 
turns out to work actually quite well particularly when your color printer has printed the color bars that indicate how things work 
i don't know whether the idea of one computer one child makes any sense here's the computer of the future because this screen is already there and they're ubiquitous 
the answer is that what you do and the details are not terribly important here is to make something more elaborate you take several different layers of paper each one containing its own little fluid system and you separate them by pieces of literally double-sided carpet tape the stuff you use to stick the carpets onto the floor 
but that is in principle the way you solve the fever of unexplained origin problem because each one of those spots then becomes a test for a particular set of markers of disease and this will work in due course 
now i have one last two last little stories to tell you in finishing off this business 
we were very proud of this particularly the title which was eggbeater as centrifuge 
we all struggled for an entire day to think about simplicity 
why are we spending $135 billion 
in the fourth act with our hubris our overconfidence developing we invaded iraq and afghanistan and in the fifth act we plunged into a humiliating mess 
when i walked across afghanistan in the winter of 2001-2002 what i saw was scenes like this 
in sangin where i was sick in 2002 the nearest health clinic was within three days walk 
and the same is true for the troops 
and the reason i'm looking a little bit perplexed in this photograph is i was somewhat frightened and i was too afraid on this occasion to ask him having run for an hour through the desert and taken refuge in this house why he had turned up and wanted to have his photograph taken with me 
now this is not to say afghanistan is a place full of people like mullah mustafa 
i ran a center at harvard from 2008 to 2010 and there were people like michael semple there who speak afghan languages fluently who've traveled to almost every district in the country 
you feel deep deep guilt 
the average british soldier is on a tour of only six months italian soldiers on tours of four months the american military on tours of 12 months 
so we need to change that institutional culture 
secondly we need to aim off of the optimism of the generals 
borders between the bosniak territory and the bosnian-serb territory have calmed down 
if what we're interested in is regional stability egypt is far more important 
just briefly what's your take on the current events there and the intervention 
what we should have done in libya is we should have stuck to the un resolution 
for the first time in the united states a predominantly white group of voters voted for an african-american candidate for president 
but really the question here -- obama did relatively well in kansas 
actually we didn't ask them but when they conducted exit polls in every state in 37 states out of the 50 they asked a question that was pretty direct about race 
and they ask a series of really interesting questions 
but you see democrats versus republican not a big difference based on who your neighbors are 
and likewise they asked not in 2000 but in the same survey in 1996 would you not vote for a qualified black president 
i'm a big fan of cities 
and it was followed a year or two later by laennec discovering the stethoscope 
it's been on calendars postage stamps in many different countries 
i call it the ipatient 
they understood her breast cancer at the molecular level they had no need to touch her breasts 
but to her it mattered deeply 
we marry for example with great pomp and ceremony and expense to signal our departure from a life of solitude and misery and loneliness to one of eternal bliss

i remember so many huge hollowed out haunted eyes staring up at me as i performed this ritual 
it was an offering an invitation 
it's the -- it's produced by the quadro corporation of west virginia 
you could dowse for all sorts of things but this particular one was built to dowse for marijuana in students' lockers 
so the way it works is you go down the hallway and you see if it tilts toward a particular locker and then you open the locker 
no it -- well it has kind of a right-leaning bias 
you can say a miracle occurs 
whereas -- and it's true scientists sometimes throw terms out as linguistic place fillers -- dark energy or dark matter or something like that -- until we figure out what it is we'll just call it this -- it's the beginning of the causal chain for science 
you don't even need photoshop you don't need high-tech equipment you don't need computers 
in the case of galileo he had two problems when he turned his telescope to saturn 
and this is what he ended up concluding that he saw 
so without a theory of planetary rings and with only grainy data you can't have a good theory 
and it wasn't solved until 1655 
and so you're reducing the quality of your data

here's the virgin mary on the backside which they started to wipe off 
and in england there's a pop singer 
in america it would be we're 6000 light years from the edge 
and so if we can do that then we can free up resources for buying drugs that you really do need for treating aids and hiv and malaria and for preventing avian flu thank you 
that is the primary function of an incubator 
and then we thought of the most simple solution we could to address this problem 
he connected with people who cared about this nonprofessionals people with passion 
henry ford comes up with a really cool idea 
it enables him to hire men who used to get paid 50 cents a day and pay them five dollars a day 
and you can build an entire industry on that 
you know the pirate tribe is a fascinating one 
so when al gore set out to change the world again he didn't do it by himself 
what kevin kelley has taught us is you just need i don't know a thousand true fans -- a thousand people who care enough that they will get you the next round and the next round and the next round 
the beatles did not invent teenagers 
she didn't invent the idea of caring about this issue 
i see what the status quo is i don't like it 
someone stands up and says this one is important 
because if you're not upsetting anyone you're not changing the status quo 
because focusing on that part of it -- not the mechanics of what you're building but the who and the leading part -- is where change comes 
so here is what leaders have in common the first thing is they challenge the status quo 
the second thing is they build a culture 
thank you very much i appreciate it 
they have different interests they have divergent values 
they were created by a kuwaiti psychologist called naif al mutawa 
now the 99 is not just a comic book 
it's now a theme park 
now while 4shbab and the 99 may look new and shiny there is actually a very long tradition of this 
and to my mind those are pretty wise words no matter what your creed thank you 
this is tootsie's orchid lounge in nashville 
and the size of the room is not that big 
he wanted a bigger band 
the halls got bigger carnegie hall's fair-sized 
and they're a lot more reverberant than la scala 
it meant that there could be extreme dynamics which there weren't in some of these other kinds of music 
it would have been impossible without recorded music as well 
and he's singing right into your ear 
he's whispering into your ears 
now there's venues like this a discotheque and there's jukeboxes in bars where you don't even need to have a band 
and as with jazz the dancers liked certain sections more than they did others 
so that doesn't really work 
and it turns out that a sound like this is the most energy efficient and practical way to transmit their call across the fields and savannahs 
it's adaptive 
and i'm saying well the passion's still there but the vessel that it's going to be injected into and poured into that is instinctively and intuitively created first 
we sing 
and like the birds the joy is still there even though we have changed what we do to fit the context 
as a clergyman you can imagine how out of place i feel 
and i was so stimulated 
but some years ago i was on an elevator in philadelphia coming down 
but i was on an airplane in the east some years ago and the man sitting across the aisle from me was the mayor of charlotte north carolina 
he said your sermons have certainly helped me 
but this is not the first time that we've had a technological revolution 
a man by the name of david came to the throne and king david became one of the great leaders of his generation 
he had the favor of god with him 
and david found that there were many problems that technology could not solve 
and yet he says he restores my soul 
we can't get along with other people even in our own families 
i'm going to harvard in about three or four -- no it's about two months from now -- to give a lecture 
what's life all about why am i here 
what shall i talk to her about 
every time you ever hear me on the television or somewhere i'm ad-libbing 
he said the lord is my shepherd 
and i said there's one thing that we have in common in this room all of us together whether republican or democrat or whoever 
as the ancient writer of ecclesiastes wrote he said there's every activity under heaven 
was there a god 
the reality of this life and his resurrection is the hope of mankind 
and i said sir i do 
he said when i leave office i'm going to spend my time writing a book on why jesus christ rose again and why it's so important to believe that 
pascal has been called the architect of modern civilization 
yet he too had to face death and he wrote these words even though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i will fear no evil for you are with me 
when i was 17 years of age i was born and reared on a farm in north carolina 
i didn't make them in college until something happened in my heart 
he was a liar 
or he was what he claimed to be 
richard wurman you did it 
i know that beat 
especially i will not die for you 
everyone can be wrong 
i will not forget where i come from 
i will craft my own drum 
i will dance and resist and dance and persist and dance 
your war drum ain't louder than this breath haaa 
what's up ted people let me hear you make some noise 
hold her now with you 
profits made prophets ignored 
faced with absence 
after two weeks of working in that village it was time to go back 
with tears in my eyes i said no 
the women's chief of the village has this little girl fair color like me totally dirty 
i wish to go to school 
several years ago a few friends of mine decided we needed to bridge the disconnect between our generation and the generation of young women 
today we've worked with over 300 
this is the dream of the african girl 
but sadly the vision of a great future or the dream of a great future is just a dream because you have all of these vices 
this is a real rural village 
now that was the advice that st benedict gave his rather startled followers in the fifth century 
up until that moment i had been that classic corporate warrior -- i was eating too much i was drinking too much i was working too hard and i was neglecting the family 
now the first step in solving any problem is acknowledging the reality of the situation you're in 
it's in their nature it's in their dna it's what they do -- even the good well-intentioned companies 
have sex 
now that can be daunting 
as i was walking out of his bedroom he said dad i went yes mate 
and the hunts point riverside park became the first waterfront park that the south bronx had had in more than 60 years 
and in the fall i'm actually going to -- i exchange marriage vows with my beloved thank you very much 
one out of four south bronx children has asthma 
residents were often given less than a month's notice before their buildings were razed 
the common perception was that only pimps and pushers and prostitutes were from the south bronx 
and luckily for me that home and the love inside of it along with help from teachers mentors and friends along the way was enough 
are these factors taken into consideration when land-use policy is decided 
once we realized that we decided it was time to do our own planning 
anyway i know chris told us not to do pitches up here but since i have all of your attention we need investors end of pitch 
anyway --   ok katrina prior to katrina the south bronx and new orleans' ninth ward had a lot in common both were largely populated by poor people of color both hotbeds of cultural innovation think hip-hop and jazz 
in the post-katrina era we have still more in common 
neither the destruction of the ninth ward nor the south bronx was inevitable 
at present that's not happening in new york city 
and although less than 25 percent of south bronx residents own cars these projects include thousands of new parking spaces yet zip in terms of mass public transit 
i do have a problem with developments that hyper-exploit politically vulnerable communities for profit 
but one of the things i do to remind myself of greater possibilities is to learn from visionaries in other cities 
he looked at the demographics 
his administration narrowed key municipal thoroughfares from five lanes to three outlawed parking on those streets expanded pedestrian walkways and bike lanes created public plazas created one of the most efficient bus mass-transit systems in the entire world 
i don't think he understood that i wasn't asking for funding 
this is more or less what we saw last year and this is how it will go on into the future 
because you see now i presented statistics that don't exist 
and this is gdp per capita on this axis 
the last century 1870 was bad for the kids in europe because most of this statistics is europe 
and this is the united states moving away here earning more money 
let us have a look at the united states 
within some years chile may have better child survival than the united states 
that's the part where i sold the volvo and bought the toyota 
and now we can see that the rate of change was enormous in japan 
sweden was like ghana 
because i have to show you one of the other facilities 
we can also make the color here represent the variable -- and what am i choosing here 
and there we are 2001 
the world is quite a messy place 
this is two to five dollars you have a bed 
i lectured on this for ikea and they wanted to see the sofa immediately here 
i would say that sub-saharan africa has done best in the world during the last 50 years 
and that's good it gets two plusses 
environment is very very crucial 
of course it's human rights 
and culture culture is the most important thing i would say because that's what brings joy to life 
even african countries can achieve this 
it's a cultural expression that for thousands of years has inspired human beings to think beyond the obvious 
and so cars as art brings it into an emotional plane -- if you accept that -- that you have to deal with on the same level you would with art with a capital a 
now at this point you're going to see a picture of michelangelo 
automobiles are self-moving things right elevators are automobiles 
cars are a sculpture -- did you know this 
ok it's not marketing there's a very interesting car concept here but the marketing part is not what i want to talk about here 
it's that will to live that need to survive to express itself that comes in a car and takes over people like me 
and we tell other people do this do this do this until this thing comes alive 
we are completely infected and beauty can be the result of this infectiousness it's quite wonderful 
now now i get to the point i want to talk about cars as art 
we're not trying to find vanity and beauty 
and that sometimes leads to bit of a divergence in why we're doing what we're doing 
toothbrush cool 
i heard today about joseph's death genes that have to go in and kill cell reproduction 
this is very difficult and you have to have a bond with your team that permits you to do this because their life is wrapped up in that too 
this is 1996 we did this project and so we sent them off with this team name deep blue now many people know deep blue from ibm -- we actually stole it from them because we figured if anybody read our faxes they'd think we're talking about computers 
and a group of engineers worked in germany and the idea was they would work separately on this problem of what's the successor to the suv 
they would come together compare notes then they would work apart come together and they would produce together a monumental set of diverse opinions that didn't pollute each other's ideas -- but at the same time came together and resolved the problems 
the bathroom was so big she built the bed over the bathtub -- it's quite fascinating 
well what i didn't know was and what we found out was -- these guys they can't even like talk to each other under those conditions 
there was a whole lot of dialog 
we spent four hours being told all about vocabulary that needs to be built between engineers and designers 
dialog kept on going with mental maps of words and pretty soon it was becoming obvious that instead of being dazzled with brilliance i was seriously being baffled with bullshit 
because of course they didn't tell us that they had three station wagons full of drawings model concepts pictures -- everything i wanted they'd locked up in the cars because they had shown solidarity with the engineers -- and they'd decided not to show me anything in order to give the chance for problem solving a chance to start because they hadn't realized of course that they couldn't do problem creating 
it's true that the trust and the love that makes it worthwhile 
we didn't sequence his genome 
and the reason is that cancer like every cell in the body places little molecular bookmarks little post-it notes that remind the cell i'm cancer i should keep growing 
we just started mailing it to our friends 
and as we treat it with our compound this addiction to sugar this rapid growth faded 
and in fact this molecule prevents this adipocyte this fat stem cell from remembering how to make fat such that mice on a high fat diet like the folks in my hometown of chicago fail to develop fatty liver which is a major medical problem 
this molecule will soon leave our benches and go into a small startup company called tensha therapeutics 
i've never seen really anywhere this unique support for cancer research 
the age of the universe between now and the big bang is a hundred billion in dog years 
if you looked at one of these galaxies and measured its velocity it would be moving away from you 
and if you look at a galaxy even farther away it would be moving away faster 
that kind of makes sense to us 
the air in this room is very smooth 
in particular things were a lot denser 
what you have to think about is we have a universe with a hundred billion galaxies a hundred billion stars each 
we'd like to understand that 
one of the people who did understand that this was a problem was richard feynman 
the arrow of time cannot be completely understood until the mystery of the beginnings of the history of the universe are reduced still further from speculation to understanding 
it's not true that we've figured it out by now 
the reason the problem has gotten worse rather than better is because in 1998 we learned something crucial about the universe that we didn't know before 
and so even though the universe will last forever and ordinary matter and radiation will dilute away there will always be some radiation some thermal fluctuations even in empty space 
it will probably increase and the probability is enormously huge 
remember life itself depends on the arrow of time 
occasionally you will make a planet or a star or a galaxy or a hundred billion galaxies 
now your homework assignment is to really think about this to contemplate what it means 
i just showed you this picture 
they all happen over a period of time equal to 10 to the 10 to the 120 years 
so here's two questions for you 
maybe there is something that naturally through the growth of the laws of physics gives rise to universe like ours in low entropy configurations 
my bold speculation is that i will be absolutely vindicated by history 
and 50 years from now all of my current wild ideas will be accepted as truths by the scientific and external communities 
this is a prediction i might be wrong 
i would like to share that story today 
like everyone else we grew maize 
i felt very happy to be at the secondary school so i was determined to do anything possible to receive education 
so i went to a library 
so i would like to say something to all the people out there like me to the africans and the poor who are struggling with your dreams 
god bless 
unlike most of our computing devices these objects are much more fun to use 
a gesture of namaste maybe to respect someone or maybe -- in india i don't need to teach a kid that this means four runs in cricket 
so i was interested in these two rollers and i actually wanted more so i borrowed another mouse from a friend -- never returned to him -- and i now had four rollers 
what i got is basically a gesture interface device that actually acts as a motion-sensing device made for two dollars 
what we are interested in is information 
so i thought around last year -- in the beginning of the last year -- i started thinking why can i not take this approach in the reverse way 
but later i realized that i actually wanted to interact with those digital pixels also 
you stop by a wall and start painting on that wall 
so technically it's a little bit complex but it gives you an output which is more intuitive to use in some sense 
rather than getting your camera out of your pocket you can just do the gesture of taking a photo and it takes a photo for you 
once it has that information it finds out more reviews about that or maybe new york times has a sound overview on that so you can actually hear on a physical book a review as sound 
so i was seeing the live [video] of his talk outside on just a newspaper 
so what i did here is remove the camera -- all the webcam cameras have a microphone inside the camera 
and i am a wilderness explorer in tribe 54) and you can of course play games 
yeah and i say ok this looks nice let me print it out that thing 
thank you 
this is incredible really 
and now if you see it's more about the cost-effectiveness this system costs you $300 compared to the $20000 surface tables or anything like that 
or maybe even the $2 mouse gesture system at that time was costing around $5000 
no this theory comes from an expert on barnacles and worms and pigeon breeding and you know who i mean charles darwin 
taste for both natural beauty and for the arts travel across cultures with great ease 
now i personally have no doubt whatsoever that the experience of beauty with its emotional intensity and pleasure belongs to our evolved human psychology 
now keeping these ideas firmly in mind we can say that the experience of beauty is one of the ways that evolution has of arousing and sustaining interest or fascination even obsession in order to encourage us toward making the most adaptive decisions for survival and reproduction 
beauty is nature's way of acting at a distance so to speak 
consider briefly an important source of aesthetic pleasure the magnetic pull of beautiful landscapes 
their symmetry their attractive materials and above all their meticulous workmanship are simply quite beautiful to our eyes even today 
competently made hand axes indicated desirable personal qualities -- intelligence fine motor control planning ability conscientiousness and sometimes access to rare materials 
so before i talk about this car for the blind let me briefly tell you about another project that i worked on called the darpa urban challenge 
now this was about building a robotic car that can drive itself 
so it's a small tablet has many holes in it and compressed air comes out so it can actually draw images 
and he's [unclear] following that van that's out in front of him 
so since we started this project we've been getting hundreds of letters emails phone calls from people from all around the world 
but potentially more important than this is the tremendous value of the spin-off technology that can come from this project 
why do we call it that 
i don't know taiwan straits 2025 
let's talk about an enemy embedded within that battle space 
they said we couldn't do iraq 
you have to create internal partners you have to access coalition partners 
we asked the russians for 40000 
they said no 
like saddam like mugabe like kim jong-il -- people who kill in hundreds of thousands or millions 
like the 250000 dead so far in sudan 
and let's call this red line i don't know mission accomplished 
what we need downstream is a great power enabled -- what i call that sys admin force 
you've got to track coalition partners create a record of success 
so they start moving from reality towards desire and they create their own special language to describe their voyage of self-discovery and self-actualization 
we bought one military and we operated another 
i used to give this brief inside the pentagon in the early 1990s 
bad pentagon bad 
it elevates mootw -- how we pronounce that acronym -- from crap to grand strategy because that's how you're going to shrink that gap 
a department of war a department of everything else 
our long-term rationale becomes we're involved in a hair trigger stand off with the soviets 
the question is how do we reconnect american national security with global security to make the world a lot more comfortable and to embed and contextualize our employment of force around the planet 
just be grateful robert reed didn't shove that bomb up his ass 
i love this force i don't want to see it go 
what does this mean in terms of operations 
the force on the right in and out 
the force on the right's going to obliterate it 
different definitions of network centricity 
but ultimately you're going to civilianize it probably two thirds 
but you need lots of these guys on the ground to win the peace 
the point about the trigger-pullers and special operations command 
see me now don't talk about it later 
the world is my playground 
i want the rules to be as loose as possible 
the town was burned down it was in the middle of winter and it was a very very severe winter 
and that's what we're going through at this time 
i wanted to just talk for one minute about the future of biotechnology because i think i know very little about that -- i'm not a biologist -- so everything i know about it can be said in one minute 
but that's hard to do unfortunately the ice is thick 
but we can look outside very cheaply and in a simple fashion 
and the step from the ocean to the land was not easy but it happened 
so they would have to have something like a reptilian skin 
the sunlight in jupiter on the satellites of jupiter is 25 times fainter than it is here since jupiter is five times as far from the sun 
this was -- originally when radio astronomy began mr jansky at the bell labs detected radio waves coming from the sky 
since there was nothing there you might as well not look 
there is something called pit lamping 
so these creatures will be bright against the cold surroundings 
i call these creatures sunflowers 
if we don't find them then we can create them ourselves 
in the long run of course it would also make it possible for us to move out there 
but in the long run if there's no life there we create it ourselves 
so again we have a big and wonderful future to look forward 
thank you 
and i realized then i had to go to design school 
or what's this num lock key for you know that thing 
and i didn't want to be a colorist 
and that allows me to check my timer discretely here without bending my elbow 
and something a little bit more experimental this is a light fixture for swarovski and what it does is it changes shape 
and the new experience i was looking for is giving the choice for the user to go from a warm sort of glowing kind of mood light all the way to a bright work light 
i want to point at something here on the left 
and this allows the bottle to turn into a game 
the bottles connect together and you can create different shapes different forms 
and then the integration of all these great technologies which you've heard about the wi-fi antennas that allow the kids to connect the screen which you can read in sunlight the keyboard which is made out of rubber and it's protected from the environment 
and if anybody asks why you're carrying a condom you can just say you like the design 
much of my life has been a quest to get some answers to these questions 
i was born and raised here in india and i learned from an early age to be deeply suspicious of the aunties and uncles who would bend down pat us on the head and then say to my parents with no problem at all poor things you only have three daughters 
late that night i heard my mother begging my father please do something ramu can't you intervene 
this is tradition 
she said to me it is not about the burka 
had i heard right 
she is on the taliban's hit list 
their path is their own and it looks towards an afghanistan that will be different 
their repertoire includes the croatian national anthem a bosnian love song and serbian duets 
in the middle ages troubadours would travel across the land singing their tales and sharing their verses lesbor travels through the balkans like this singing connecting people divided by religion nationality and language 
the world layma bowie was given was a world at war 
at the next friday sermon the women who were sitting in the side room of the mosque began to share their distress at the state of affairs 
in a now famous cnn clip you can see them sitting on the ground their arms linked 
the police are called in to physically remove the women 
and then you realize that by integrating aspects of tradition and community into their struggles women like sakena and leah and layma -- but also women like sonia gandhi here in india and michelle bachelet in chile and shirin ebadi in iran -- are doing something else 
and the first thing i wanted to do as a muslim was go to mecca and visit the kaaba the holiest shrine of islam 
and i did that i put on my ritualistic dress i went to the holy mosque i did my prayers i observed all the rituals 
in other words men and women were worshiping all together 
and i think it's not an accident that you don't find this idea in the very origin of islam 
on the other hand the westerners who look at islamic culture and see some troubling aspects should not readily conclude that this is what islam ordains 
and the religious police imposes the supposed islamic way of life on every citizen by force -- like women are forced to cover their heads -- wear the hijab the islamic head cover 
let me give you an example in turkey where i come from which is a very hyper-secular republic until very recently we used to have what i call secularism police which would guard the universities against veiled students 
in other words they would force students to uncover their heads and i think forcing people to uncover their head is as tyrannical as forcing them to cover it 
which means that muslims can today look at those things and say well the core of our religion is here to stay with us 
and even the very extreme forms of islamism led to terrorism in the name of islam -- which is actually a practice that i think is against islam but some obviously extremists did not think that way 
and i think the west at least some powers in the west particularly the united states made the mistake of supporting those secular dictators thinking that they were more helpful for their interests 
secondly in the past two decades thanks to globalization thanks to the market economy thanks to the rise of a middle-class we in turkey see what i define as a rebirth of islamic modernism 
as a photographer for national geographic i've portrayed it for many 
and where that energy touches water something new emerges life 
shallow seas nurtured life early on and that's where it morphed into more complex forms 
the fundamental forms of ferns followed to bear spores that foreshadowed seeds 
leatherbacks and tuataras are echoes from that era 
jurassic park still shimmers in part of madagascar and the center of brazil where plants called cycads remain rock hard 
flamingos covered continents migrations got underway 
water lilies were among the first 
in africa gondwana molded proteas 
tropical rainforests arose sparking new layers of interdependence 
a trick shared by the largest flower on earth 
an asteroid hits and the world went down in flames 
primates emerge from jungles as tarsiers first becoming lemurs not much later 
and you all here today can imagine and will shape where we go next 
today i want to talk to you about ethnic conflict and civil war 
but let's start at the beginning 
well notwithstanding the gloomy pictures from the middle east darfur iraq elsewhere there is a longer-term trend that does represent some good news 
the news about civilian casualties is also less bad than it used to be 
thus even though every civilian killed maimed raped or tortured is one too many the fact that the number of civilian casualties is clearly lower today than it was a decade ago is good news 
but let's look at the good news again 
but then is northern ireland a unique example or does this kind of explanation only hold more generally in democratic and developed countries 
a final example kosovo 
central among them are three 
by the same token -- and here we have some good news again -- the very fact that there is a high-level well-resourced international presence in kosovo and the balkans region more generally and the fact that local leaders on both sides have showed relative restraint explains why things have not been worse over the past two years since 2008 
a final thought ending civil wars is a process that is fraught with dangers frustrations and setbacks 
thank you 
i'm going to talk about some of my discoveries around the world through my work 
and at that young age 10 years old benki became the paje of his community 
he went 3000 miles on an odyssey to rio to the earth summit to tell the world what was happening in his tiny little corner 
benki came back to his village full of ideas -- new technologies new research new ways of understanding what was going on 
he's built schools to teach children to care for the forest 
together he's led the reforestation of over 25 percent of the land that had been destroyed by the loggers 
why are you putting yourself at risk 
so when i think of that i wonder what our grandchildren and our great-grandchildren when they ask themselves that question i wonder how they will answer 
for me the world is veering towards a future we don't much want when we really think about it deep inside 
you also know that we can't just keep doing what we've always done because we'll get the results we've always gotten 
we have to change 
it's imperative to me when i look around the world that we need to change ourselves 
sanghamitra didn't start life as a leader of an ngo she started her career as university professor teaching english literature 
they take care of 20000-odd people today in over 1000 villages around karnataka 
they've pioneered a different approach to villages 
instead of handing out information in pamphlets as is so often the case they bring theater troupes songs music dance 
sanghamitra told me just last week -- she had just come back from two weeks in the villages and she had a real breakthrough 
he has nine other buildings -- that are already open to the public -- filled to the rafters with artifacts documenting contemporary chinese history 
they looked outside and then they changed what was on the inside 
they've gone away from what they did before and they've gone to something they didn't know 
he went around once he went around twice he went around thrice 
and so when you study it you realize that different people of the world have a different understanding of the world 
perhaps he was a jain monk like bahubali over here the gomateshwara bahubali whose image is not far from mysore 
alexander asked what are you doing 
and they both laughed 
what should you not be 
you should not be sisyphus who rolls a rock up a mountain all day only to find the boulder rolled down at night 
and he wanted to hoist his flag to say i was here first 
this was the mythology of the gymnosophist 
but they were not two characters on two different adventures 
you see the indians also had a river that separates the land of the living from the land of the dead 
you go again and again and again 
two different mythologies two different ways of looking at the world 
and i believe it is this mythological paradigm that inspired indian mathematicians to discover the number zero 
who knows 
standard business model vision mission values processes 
you see this is what india is today the ground reality is based on a cyclical world view 
i have personally experienced it i'm trained as a medical doctor 
and he knew very intuitively that best practices developed in japan and china and europe and america will not work in india 
you can't measure it you can't manage it 
after a leader completes his training and is about to take over the store we blindfold him we surround him with the stakeholders the customer his family his team his boss 
that sensitivity is what we need once this belief enters behavior will happen business will happen 
but that was interesting in itself this is companies like vonage 
the little box has your phone number 
it's really cute seeing middle-aged people like me try out skype for the first time which is usually when their kid goes away for a semester abroad 
they don't want to pay the international fees so they're like timmy is that you 
imagine if you had an ordinary cell phone and any time you were in a wireless hotspot -- free calls anywhere in the world never pay the cellular company a nickel 
and when you're out of the hotspot you're on the regular cellular network 
you're thinking well how often am i in a hotspot 
because they give you a regular wireless router that works with the phone for your house 
they don't have that kind of money instead they give each of us a seven-dollar-and-95-cent box they're like a stealth tower installation program 
now i'm leaving the house dp i'm going for a walk -- do you mind 
i don't know why my wife says i never listen to her i don't get that 
i have two cellphones so this going to be very odd if it works 
excuse me one second 
all right we've made the point 
the beauty of that is you never miss a call 
google bought it and they've been working on it for a year 
i actually got a photograph of the verizon employee right there 
anyway so lets say you need a drugstore near chicago 
here it comes 
and it's already written down -- so like if you're driving you don't have to do one of these things uh huh uh huh uh huh 
shortly i'll tell you why i was in milan 
that's cute i do have an email address you can just ask me 
it's absolutely phenomenal the only downside is that it requires you to know how to text -- send a text message nobody over 40 knows how to do that 
so i'm going to teach you something even better 
they put this teeny-weeny little ad about 10 characters long 
because there is one 
as you can imagine it's college kids and old people 
when i call to leave you a message i get 15 seconds of instructions from a third-grade teacher on ambien 
so now i'm going to tell you how to get out of that 
the reason i think that is that on the first day i tried one of these services i got two voicemail messages one was from a guy named michael stevenson which shouldn't be that hard to transcribe and it was misspelled 
i love my job 
i'm not kidding you the message said was walking along the street and sky was blue and emergency 
and lastly i just have to talk about this one 
phone well that's good 
what are you doing 
actually even so he was turned down by verizon and others 
it's got bad things and good things lets all acknowledge that right now 
it's absurd we have power outlets in every room of every building we have running water 
you type in what you want and it gives you the translation 
i know it's insane right 
it will immediately play you that song or that band 
if you like that one or don't like it you do thumbs-up and thumbs-down over time it tailors the songs so that it completely stops playing bad songs 
it proposes a restaurant 
and now the end is near 
i want an iphone 
who cares if it's at&ampt 
because the breast has become are very political organ 
i will do my best this morning to tell you what i think is the truth 
but first my disclosures 
she came to see me after discovering a breast lump 
you may recall a year ago when a firestorm erupted after the united states preventive services task force reviewed the world's mammography screening literature and issued a guideline recommending against screening mammograms in women in their 40s 
screening the average young woman with an mri is kind of like driving to the grocery store in a hummer 
but the problem was that the gamma detectors were these huge bulky tubes and they were filled with these scintillating crystals and you just couldn't get them close enough around the breast to find small tumors 
to say that we faced high doses of skepticism in those early years is just a huge understatement but we were so convinced that we might be able to make this work that we chipped away with incremental modifications to this system 
the patient receives an injection of a radio tracer that's taken up by rapidly proliferating tumor cells but not by normal cells and this is the key difference from mammography 
our big break came in 2004 
after we had demonstrated that we could find small tumors we used these images to submit a grant to the susan g komen foundation 
and we were elated when they took a chance on a team of completely unknown investigators and funded us to study 1000 women with dense breasts comparing a screening mammogram to an mbi 
here's an example from that screening study 
it takes a radiologist years of specialty training to become expert in differentiating the normal anatomic detail from the worrisome finding 
but i suspect even the non-radiologists in the room can find the tumor on the mbi image 
after the fourth rejection we requested reconsideration of the manuscript because we strongly suspected that one of the reviewers who had rejected it had a financial conflict of interest in a competing technology 
some women who develop breast cancer die from it many years later and most women thankfully survive 
so i worked with white noise 
and do not be disturbed any more by the other aggressive sound 
but it is just physiology it's just in your brain 
so in order to make this white noise a little bit active and reactive i create a ball a rolling ball able to analyze and find where does aggressive sound come from and roll at home or at work towards aggressive noise and emits white noise in order to neutralize it 
a loving dispute with your girl or boyfriend 
anyway in this same kind of approach i designed k 
i'm just a designer so i need them 
and the irony for me was of course i didn't do that for the sake of science progress 
i just do that to make money 
so we took too many of them 
this one is an antibiotic 
but in this case it is not the medication that is dependent on the patient 
so the idea is all night long the elastic skin of the third lung will slowly inflate itself including air and molecules for sure 
you have to know or you probably already know that indoor air pollution is more toxic than outdoor one 
so while i'm talking to you the seats you are sit on are currently emitting some invisible and odorless toxic gas sorry for that 
so your sofa your plastic chair your kid's toys give their own invisible reality and this one is very toxic 
this one is kind of the same approach because i include in a product like andrea some plants 
indeed this object is a domestic farm for fishes and green 
so the idea of this object is to be able to get at home very local food 
after it goes back into the fish tank 
now we can eat local food 
see like this one 
you can see it there 
we're the new technologists 
i think about world war ii -- some of our great technologists then some of our great physicists studying nuclear fission and fusion -- just nuclear stuff 
we want the people building the technology thinking about what we should be doing with the technology 
so we can protect ourselves if he was up to no good 
so to get people warmed up let's start with an easy question -- something i'm sure everybody here has an opinion about iphone versus android 
but he was worried that all we seem to be doing is trading opinions about this 
in math we know the objective facts 
it's an objective truth about the form of two the abstract form 
then you would know what was really just and what wasn't 
if you think that way you have a platonist moral framework 
he thought it was impractical 
it's just a matter of the consequences 
kant was very good on this point and he said it a little better than i'll say it 
what should we be doing what's the answer 
there's not a formula 
and don't just find another technologist friend find somebody different than you 
we care what happens in that opera 
in the early '80s some would say 
the gang had no way to make money 
so he was a math major in college who had a good heart and decided he wanted to get a sociology phd came to the university of chicago 
and in his own words he looked like a freak 
so he showed up at the university of chicago 
there was a lot of gunfire there were a lot of philosophical discussions he had with the gang members 
and you and i probably faced with the situation would think well i guess i'm going to write my dissertation on the grateful dead 
but the thing that really makes the gang seem like mcdonald's is its franchisees 
so what do the wages look like so you might be surprised 
we found in our gang -- and admittedly this was not really sort of a standard situation this was a time of intense violence -- of a lot of gang wars -- as this gang actually became quite successful but there were costs 
that makes you pause -- gives you some pause -- those of you who believe that a death penalty's going to have an enormous deterrent effect on crime 
that the young people controlled the gang -- that as you got older you dropped out of the gang 
so what happened was the people who happened to be in the right place at the right time -- the people who happened to be leading the gang in the mid- to late '80s -- became very very wealthy 
you know he would say to his friends hey look at all the money i got in the gang 
often our theories fail quite miserably when we go to the data 
this is one of the basic ideas in labor economics called a compensating differential 
it's why we think garbage men might be paid more than people who work in parks ok 
so in the words of one of the members of the gang i think makes this clear 
and the words of a gang member capture it quite nicely 
if you start taking losses they see you as weak and shit 
and i thought about it and i said ceos often pay themselves million-dollar bonuses even when companies are losing a lot of money 
also different aerobatic maneuvers are possible with a paraglider 
you can see the skydiver with the red suit he's in a stand-up position 
this is a jump i did in rio de janeiro 
2005 i did a base jump from the eiger from the monk and from the jungfrau three very famous mountains in switzerland 
june cohen i have some questions 
yet but people are trying are you among those -- you're not going to commit -- are you among those trying to do it 
it's a dream it's a dream yeah 
and is that how you usually fly 
do people come to you with projects and say we want you to do this 
i don't necessarily think the film is so interesting 
the show was in a sense about that 
i also put a mirror in the ceiling and some fog some haze 
and what happens is that people they start to see themselves in this space 
what does it matter 
it makes a difference whether you say i'm a part of this city 
it's quite simple and fundamental 
it doesn't really tell you what you're looking at 
or is that a three-hour hike or is that a whole day i'm looking at 
if you have a waterfall in there right out there at the horizon you look at the waterfall and you go oh the water is falling really slowly 
and experience is not just a kind of entertainment in a non-casual way 
so art in that sense i think holds an incredible relevance in the world in which we're moving into particularly right now 
what i really enjoyed about this project is reviving these people's words 
so what we're going to do next is a poem that was written by nathalia crane 
the next poem is if no one ever marries me 
he went there after the death of his wife of smallpox and brought his two young children 
just bring it down a little  
thank you so much 
or this idea of the misunderstood genius frustrated that the world doesn't fit in with his or her ideas 
and quite often we sit in a design meeting and we discover that there is this great idea 
but for another client in another culture it could really be the right answer to a different question 
and they chose this mascot because the theme of the expo is better city better life 
but then we looked at recent urban development and we noticed that this is like a shanghai street 30 years ago all bikes no cars 
so if you come to the expo go straight to the danish pavilion get a danish bike and then continue on that to visit the other pavilions 
and in the middle of this sort of harbor bath we're actually going to put the actual little mermaid 
so the second story that i'd like to tell is actually starts in my own house 
and we discovered that by controlling the size of the holes we could actually turn the entire facade into a gigantic naturally ventilated rasterized image 
it has no water it has no energy no resources 
they accumulate the solar energy 
yes maybe just to round off 
i'm just going to list some of them 
where should we start on solving these problems 
to climate change that would be like kyoto 
i'd love to go into and get you to think about this process and that's actually what we did 
of course you have to ask yourself why on earth was such a list never done before 
nobody wants to do this 
we'd like to know these things 
three of the world's top experts saying what can we do 
what would be the price 
and of course i'm very happy you asked that question --  -- because that's a very good question 
this offends a lot of people and that's probably one of the things where people will say i shouldn't come back either 
and i'd like to talk about that because that's really curious 
the reason why they came up with saying that kyoto -- or doing something more than kyoto -- is a bad deal is simply because it's very inefficient 
it's not to say that if we had all the money in the world we wouldn't want to do it 
there are many problems out there in the world 
and what i want to make sure of is if we actually focus on problems that we focus on the right ones 
the ones where we can do a lot of good rather than a little good 
and of course we'll be even richer than that 
we have you know the day after tomorrow -- it looks great right 
it's not about making things that have the most media attention but it's about making places where we can actually do the most good 
but the point of course is still to say if you get another 100 billion dollars we still want to spend that in the best possible way don't we 
so we actually invited 80 young people from all over the world to come and solve the same problem 
my studio in bali was only 10 minutes away from a monkey forest and monkeys of course are supposed to be the happiest of all animals 
the serif is not really in place 
and the rider thinks that he can tell the elephant what to do but the elephant really has his own ideas 
and from that point of view we turned it into a lovely project 
we stir this in until it's completely dissolved and then pour it into a growth bath 
and then we're ready to add the living organism 
and actually in hot weather i can just grow it outside 
but i do think it could be quite a smart and sustainable addition to our increasingly precious natural resources 
thank you very much 
suzanne lee  
i made contact with a child from swat who studied in a madrassa like this 
how do the taliban in your area get people to join them 
then they take us to a madrassa and teach us things from the koran 
they ask us to use them only against the infidels 
soc i in my research have seen that the taliban have perfected the way in which they recruit and train children and i think it's a five-step process 
these children are explicitly forbidden from reading newspapers listening to radio reading any books that the teachers do not prescribe them 
effectively the taliban create a complete blackout of any other source of information for these children 
he blew himself up killing six 
two years ago here at ted i reported that we had discovered at saturn with the cassini spacecraft an anomalously warm and geologically active region at the southern tip of the small saturnine moon enceladus seen here 
while they're not amino acids we're now finding things like propane and benzene hydrogen cyanide and formaldehyde 
so we are very encouraged by these results 
and this is quite an extraordinary idea but it is reality today 
this was created by an architectural firm called shiro 
and you can actually walk into it 
now 3d printing can break away barriers in design which challenge the constraints of mass production 
there's a lower chance of rejection 
the piece of software will keep an individual within the bounds of the possible 
i don't think that will happen soon 
we're now instead of shipping a product across the world we're sending data across the internet 
and applying this to the idea of building up what's in our bodies 
so one of the pioneers for example is dr anthony atala and he has been working on layering cells to create body parts -- bladders valves kidneys 
we like different things 
i've been working on issues of poverty for more than 20 years and so it's ironic that the problem that and question that i most grapple with is how you actually define poverty what does it mean 
and i would see kids on the street corners and they'd say obama he's our brother 
and she said you know the poverty wasn't so bad it was the humiliation and the embarrassment of it all 
and i say 'look at me you are not dead 
and in the middle of this economic crisis where so many of us are inclined to pull in with fear i think we're well suited to take a cue from jane and reach out recognizing that being poor doesn't mean being ordinary 
it was a really big excitement for me to get into caltech 
and i concluded after researching every other technology that we could deploy for storing energy -- flywheels different formulations of batteries -- it just wasn't practical to store energy 
there are a lot of new things that are happening to do that but fundamentally the process requires a tremendous amount of energy 
so i tried to figure out what other way could we try and make cost-effective solar electricity 
traditionally concentrators look like this 
your efficiency goes down with more bounces because you lose about 10 percent with each bounce but this allowed us to collect light from a plus or minus 25 degree angle 
so once you have mobility now you're making a lot of engines because you've got lots of units as opposed to steam ships or big factories where you're not making as many units so this was the engine that ended up benefiting from mass production where all the other engines didn't benefit 
so we tried to look at the stirling engine in a new way because it was practical -- weight no longer mattered for our application the internal combustion engine took off because weight mattered because you were moving around 
so someone came up with a very clever idea to -- instead of heating the whole cylinder and cooling the whole cylinder what about if you put a displacer inside -- a little thing that shuttles the air back and forth 
we measured each one we readjusted the model to what we measured and then we led that to the current prototype 
it led to a very compact inexpensive engine and this is what the engine looks like 
so an example of that is here's the map of the united states 
and of course look at africa 
there's 10000 watts of light pouring on the stage one horsepower is 756 watts at full power 
but everywhere around us we have insatiable use for energy because it's so cheap 
and it's cheap because we've been subsidized by energy that's been concentrated by the sun 
headlines that look like this when they have to do with climate change and headlines that look like this when they have to do with air quality or smog 
and this is the tower from below 
so as you can imagine the inside of this aircraft doesn't look like any plane you would take on vacation 
we do all of this to understand the chemistry of one molecule 
what i am always thinking about is what this session is about which is called simplicity 
so i was fortunate enough to be born a very dreamy child 
and that was a good thing to help you know the cause 
but then he came back and things happened and i decided i really hated my writing that it was awful awful purple prose 
well tibor really started the studio called m&ampco 
that to be able to talk about content to break apart what you normally expect to use humor and surprise elegance and humanity in your work was really important to us 
i don't really -- i mean i could tell you that i didn't understand i'm not proud of it but i didn't understand let's say 95 percent of the talks at this conference 
so i'm open to the possibilities of not knowing and finding out something new 
and so i was able to put that into this story which is an alphabet and hopefully go on to something else 
i work for the new yorker and i do covers and 9/11 happened and it was you know a complete and utter end of the world as we knew it 
we hoped we'd be funny but we didn't know it would be a cover and we didn't know that that image at the moment that it happened would be something that would be so wonderful for a lot of people 
and david remnick who was really wonderful about it had one problem he didn't like al zheimers because he thought it would insult people with alzheimer's 
and he noticed a large stain in the center of the rug 
so what i did when i was painting was i started singing because i really adore singing and i think that music is the highest form of all art 
i happen to know it for a fact 
maybe amongst themselves they had a few good laughs but stalin was a paranoid man even more than my father 
which i think i made up which is a good thing 
i received a box in the mail and it was wrapped with newspaper and there was the picture of the man on the newspaper and he was dead 
and i really spend a lot of time wondering how much truth do we tell 
how do we know when we are ourselves 
a quote by bertrand russell all the labor of all the ages all the devotion all the inspiration all the noonday brightness of human genius are destined to extinction 
and i would like to run it for them 
and it says ich habe genug which is a bach cantata which i once thought meant i've had it i can't take it anymore give me a break but i was wrong 
i thought that things would be pretty fun and there would be more things to play with 
so since we've been here this week we've taken millions of breaths collectively and perhaps we haven't witnessed any course changes happening in our lives but we often miss the very subtle changes 
so we threw in -- we created a primordial soup with lots of pieces of robots -- with bars with motors with neurons 
we're concerned in the national security community and of course in the biology community and the public health community 
it's also carried on migration patterns of wild migratory aquatic birds 
so what have people been doing with this money 
let's everybody run around and play your role 
most local facilities would all be competing to try and get their hands on their piece of the federal stockpile of a drug called tamiflu which may or may not be helpful -- i'll get into that -- of available vaccines and any other treatments and masks and anything that's been stockpiled 
and you'll have massive competition 
during the sars epidemic in beijing quarantine did seem to help 
and their hand got contaminated with the outside of the mask and then they rubbed their nose bingo they got sars 
the pandemic circulated three times in 18 months in the absence of commercial air travel 
this was based on european and north american data 
and that a more likely toll is somewhere in the neighborhood of 80 to 100 million people before we had commercial air travel 
so are we ready 
if you expand that out to think of a whole community or all your employees in your company you begin to realize how limited the tamiflu option might be 
but really do you really have a place to stockpile 18 months worth of food twenty-four months worth of food 
do you want to view the pandemic threat the way back in the 1950s people viewed the civil defense issue and build your own little bomb shelter for pandemic flu 
and i hope i've convinced you of that which means that the real job is go out and say to your local leaders and your national leaders why haven't you solved these problems 
but can you sustain your company that way 
the moment that you see any evidence of serious human-to-human to transmission 
the mechanism isn't clear 
again we don't really know for sure 
audience member one of the things i've heard is that the real death cause when you get a flu is the associated pneumonia and that a pneumonia vaccine may offer you 50 percent better chance of survival 
and so far in the h5n1 cases in people similarly bacterial infection has not been an issue at all 
and it won't do any good to bring in the tanks and the artillery because those t-cells don't recognize it either 
now my story has a lot to do with dreaming although i'm known to make my dreams come true 
one two three four five six and seven 
and i go to see a famous magician and proudly ask him well what do you think 
for the move to be professional it has to be less than one second and it has to be perfect 
but in america you have to explain what are clubs 
they have to be precisely lathed 
anyway here i was progressing with my new clubs 
the clubs were escaping me at each throw 
so i proudly showed him my clubs 
he said philippe you have been had 
they are impossible to juggle 
i get a pair of pliers and some coat hangers and i gather them together in some kind of ropey path 
well within a few days i'm able to do one crossing 
if not i will never do that first step 
it's a straight line which sags which sways which vibrates which rolls on itself which is ice which is three tons tight ready to explode ready to swallow me 
an inner howl assails me the wild longing to flee 
i was not interested in collecting the gigantic in breaking records 
and something happened 
he didn't know the true story 
trees are wonderful arenas for discovery because of their tall stature their complex structure the biodiversity they foster and their quiet beauty 
the most mysterious part of forests is the upper tree canopy 
these are not epiphyte roots these are roots that emerge from the trunk and branch of the host trees themselves 
we know it's a lot but we do not yet know the answers to how much and by what processes carbon is being taken out of the atmosphere held in its biomass and moving on through the ecosystem 
they ended up making a cd which they took home to their family and friends thereby expressing their own experiences with nature in their own medium 
they were incredibly enthusiastic about the work 
and they embraced the idea that they could help develop a research design in order to grow these mosses 
we gave talks once a month and that actually ended up implementing some amazing sustainability projects at the prisons -- organic gardens worm culture recycling water catchment and beekeeping  
as many of you are aware the world of academia is a rather inward-looking one 
i'm trying to help researchers move more outward to have their own partnerships with people outside of the academic community 
when i look into my heart i see trees -- this is actually an image of a real heart -- there are trees in our hearts there are trees in your hearts 
it was taken 18 years ago 
there is a problem with scuba though in that it imposes some limitations on how deep you can go and it turns out that depth is about 200 feet 
and there's a phenomenon called henry's law that says that gases will dissolve into a fluid in proportion to the partial pressures which you're exposing them to 
you die also because oxygen toxicity can cause a seizure -- makes you convulse underwater not a good thing to happen underwater 
this picture was taken 300 feet deep catching new species of fish 
and indeed there is a better way 
alright closed-circuit rebreather -- what is it about it that makes it different from scuba and why is it better 
well there are three main advantages to a rebreather 
so we need another gas something to dilute the oxygen with 
but if we want to go deeper of course we need another gas supply 
now normally you don't have to do that because all of it's done automatically for you with the electronics the third system of a rebreather 
and yes it's a little nerve-wracking 
so sharks aren't quite as dangerous as most people make them out to be 
there's a cover story all about the great explorers of our time 
the last article is an article entitled no new frontiers 
even if you ignore the scientific value of this thing just look at the monetary value of this thing 
and then eventually i got around to looking in my bucket 
now this one's pretty cool 
so a very large percentage of what is out there isn't really known 
we thought we had a handle on all the reef fish diversity -- evidently not 
at the beginning i told you that i was going to show you two extraordinary photographs 
the reason i show this -- not to put a downer on everything -- but i just want to use it to key off my philosophy of life in general which is that we all have two goals 
the first goal we share with every other living thing on this planet which is to survive i call it perpetuation the survival of the species and survival of ourselves because they're both about perpetuating the genome 
you have to balance those two goals 
but here's what really perplexed me 
but diagnosing a brain disorder without actually looking at the brain is analogous to treating a patient with a heart problem based on their physical symptoms without even doing an ecg or a chest x-ray to look at the heart 
yet despite all the advances in medical technology the diagnosis of brain disorders in one in six children still remained so limited 
and then i came across a team at harvard university that had taken one such advanced medical technology and finally applied it instead of in brain research towards diagnosing brain disorders in children 
and another program called statistical probability mapping then performs mathematical calculations to determine whether any of these abnormalities are clinically significant allowing us to provide a much more accurate neurological diagnosis of the child's symptoms 
when we used this groundbreaking eeg technology to actually look at justin's brain the results were startling 
but we are now in a new era of neuroscience one in which we can finally look directly at brain function in real time with no risks and no side effects non-invasively and find the true source of so many disabilities in children 
it's something like life that once you get in it you can't get out 
there are two clips i want to show you the first one is a kind of hodgepodge its just three little moments four little moments with three of the people who are here tonight 
it was built entirely by hand off bamboo scaffolding people carrying these baskets of concrete on their heads dumping them in the forms 
so those are the two clips i'm going to show 
i mean as tragic as his death was in a railway station it was so consistent with his life you know 
man yes it is the national image of bangladesh 
no he never saw this 
and this is the largest project he has got in here the poorest country in the world 
it's a story of nations of ideologies of territories and of conflicts among them 
here 
are we alone in this vast universe of energy and matter and chemistry and physics 
whether we're born in san francisco or sudan or close to the heart of the milky way galaxy we are the products of a billion-year lineage of wandering stardust 
well what about 10^22 
that line would have to be 38 million miles above this stage 
i think this is what david deutsch meant in 2005 when he ended his oxford tedtalk by saying he had two principles he'd like to share for living and he would like to carve them on stone tablets 
we've been searching ever since but it's impossible to overstate the magnitude of the search that remains 
and over those long distances its signal is very faint when it reaches us 
but this is a simple signal and tomorrow we want to be able to find more complex signals 
this is a very good year 
2009 is the 400th anniversary of galileo's first use of the telescope darwin's 200th birthday the 150th anniversary of the publication of on the origin of species the 50th anniversary of seti as a science the 25th anniversary of the incorporation of the seti institute as a non-profit and of course the 25th anniversary of ted 
the first step would be to tap into the global brain trust to build an environment where raw data could be stored and where it could be accessed and manipulated where new algorithms could be developed and old algorithms made more efficient 
i'm sorry seth godin but over the millennia we've seen where tribalism leads 
it records the annual rise and fall of greenhouse gases and temperatures going back before the onset of the last ice ages 
ten times a day they extract the 10-foot long cylinder of compressed ice crystals that contain the unsullied air and trace chemicals laid down by snow season after season for thousands of years 
from this we can detect an extraordinary number of things 
imagine juggling a snowball across the tropics 
they have to in fact make sure this ice never gets warmer than about 20 degrees below zero otherwise the key gases inside it will dissipate 
early explorers sailed off the edge of the map and they found a place where the normal rules of time and temperature seem suspended 
it is a voice of experience 
it is a voice we should heed 
this thesis is set out in a book called winning the oil endgame that four colleagues and i wrote and have posted for free at oilendgamecom -- about 170000 downloads so far 
so when we did we found some very surprising things 
and serious competition from europe from korea and next is china which will soon be a major net exporter of cars 
the point here is these cars are going to be made super efficient 
the question is who will make them 
it's financeable in the private capital market 
and in the upper left a pioneering effort 14 years ago by gm -- 84 miles a gallon without even using a hybrid in a four-seater 
in the airplane business it's again a similar story where the first 20 percent fuel saving is free as boeing is now demonstrating in its new dreamliner 
and it turns out that these are quite remarkable for safety 
the golf was totaled 
because these materials could actually absorb six to 12 times as much energy per pound as steel and do so a lot more smoothly 
this expands choice rapidly in the market and actually makes more money for automakers as well 
i'd like to deal with the lack of affordable personal mobility in this country by making it very cheaply possible for low-income families to get efficient reliable warranted new cars that they could otherwise never get 
this creates a new million-car-a-year market for detroit from customers they weren't going to get otherwise because they weren't creditworthy and could never afford a new car 
it turns out that if say african-american and white households had the same car ownership it would cut employment disparity about in half by providing better access to job opportunities 
just turn it over to the private sector and we have an internet 
ours is on the demand side 
i was just coming out of a failed virtual reality business and supporting myself by being on the speaking circuit and writing books -- after twenty years or so in the computer game industry having ideas that people didn't think they could sell 
and at the end of those remarkable conversations with kids and their best friends across the united states after two years we pulled together some survey data from another 10000 children drew up a set up of what we thought were the key findings of our research and spent another year transforming them into design heuristics for designing computer-based products -- and in fact any kind of products -- for little girls ages eight to 12 
and these voices will be accompanied by photographs that they took for us of their lives of the things that they value and care about 
girl 3 this is my pretend [unclear] one 
this is the second day in rockett's life 
i wanted to show you the ways innocuous as they seem in which we're incorporating what we've learned about girls -- their desires to experience greater emotional flexibility and to play around with the social complexity of their lives 
he went through europe through world war ii stealing extorting and occasionally buying various paintings for his collection 
so he finally found an art dealer a dutch art dealer named han van meegeren who sold him a wonderful vermeer for the cost of what would now be 10 million dollars 
he had a lesser charge of forgery got a year sentence and died a hero to the dutch people 
many sociologists like veblen and wolfe would argue that the reason why we take origins so seriously is because we're snobs because we're focused on status 
would you eat this 
few of you would eat it if it's a rat or a human 
it's simple you tell them they're from mcdonald's 
it's very simple pour it from an expensive bottle 
it will make a difference if they turn out to be much younger or much older than you think they are 
that drops the value of it suggesting that that's one reason why we like it 
rather it's because i want something that has a specific history 
who here likes the work of jackson pollock 
and the washington post reporter gene weingarten decided to enlist him for an audacious experiment 
so he got joshua bell to take his million dollar violin down to a washington dc subway station and stand in the corner and see how much money he would make 
he actually made 20 dollars more than that but he didn't count it 
so she's stunned that he's standing in a subway station 
one lovely experiment was done by kurt gray and dan wegner 
and what i hope to show is that unpicking dodgy claims unpicking the evidence behind dodgy claims isn't a kind of nasty carping activity it's socially useful but it's also an extremely valuable explanatory tool 
she it turns out has a non-accredited correspondence course phd 
a glass of red wine a day could help prevent breast cancer 
so i'm going to tell you about one trial which is probably the most well-reported trial in the uk news media over the past decade 
and this has been demonstrated in a whole raft of fascinating studies comparing one kind of placebo against another 
we know from three different studies on three different types of pain that a saltwater injection is a more effective treatment for pain than taking a sugar pill taking a dummy pill that has no medicine in it -- not because the injection or the pills do anything physically to the body but because an injection feels like a much more dramatic intervention 
but that's not enough 
what i find really fascinating is that the pharmaceutical industry uses exactly the same kinds of tricks and devices but slightly more sophisticated versions of them in order to distort the evidence that they give to doctors and patients and which we use to make vitally important decisions 
and it's a foregone conclusion if you give a drug at that high a dose that it will have more side effects and that your new drug will look better 
everybody wanted to show that their drug was better than risperidone so you see a bunch of trials comparing new antipsychotic drugs against risperidone at eight milligrams a day 
this is a drug called reboxetine 
around half of all of the trial data on antidepressants has been withheld but it goes way beyond that 
but the companies withheld that data from them and so did the european medicines agency for three years 
the infectious diseases cochrane group which are based in italy has been trying to get the full data in a usable form out of the drug companies so that they can make a full decision about whether this drug is effective or not and they've not been able to get that information 
this is undoubtedly the single biggest ethical problem facing medicine today 
thank you very much 
i saw people struggling to get by not knowing what was what and what was next 
you want a better life for yourself 
there's this thing this militarization of the world and it's centered right in the united states 
and the united states is responsible for almost one half of the world's military spending -- four percent of the world's population 
and you feel it you see it every day 
you say how is that possible 
and their leaders their leaders before they send their sons and daughters off to war in your country -- and you know the reason -- before they send them off they go to a christian church and they pray to their christian god and they ask for protection and guidance from that god 
why 
they do wonderful things but they also do the bad things and you can't tell the difference 
and this guy you get a guy like lt gen william boykin 
and you're thinking god if this guy is saying that then all the soldiers must be saying that 
and this word here george bush called this war a crusade 
it's a holy war against muslims 
you feel frightened of course you feel frightened 
he wants to burn korans our holy book 
you don't know that 
so here 
and this is a perspective 
so here's what i want you to do 
i'm going out to defend your freedom your lives 
and if i can get you to step into their shoes and walk an inch one tiny inch then imagine the kind of sociological analysis that you can do in all other aspects of your life 
thank you 
it was only in the second half of the 20th century that we slowly began to pull ourselves out of this abyss 
you know in 1950 the typical ship carried 5000 to 10000 tons worth of goods 
today a container ship can carry 150000 tons it can be manned with a smaller crew and unloaded faster than ever before 
and i think as you'll see there's reasons for optimism because i believe that the best is yet to come 
well how else can we create new ideas 
how else can we create new ideas 
that is a good thing 
how many ramanujans are there in india today toiling in the fields barely able to feed themselves when they could be feeding the world 
twenty-first century could easily be 33 even higher percent 
even at that rate by 2100 average gdp per capita in the world will be $200000 
that's not that far 
but some of our grandchildren probably will 
what about a great depression 
now let's imagine that you were an economist in 1929 trying to forecast future growth for the united states not knowing that the economy was about to go off a cliff not knowing that we were about to enter the greatest economic disaster certainly in the 20th century 
in the last 30 years thanks to explorations in remote parts of the world and advances in technology biologists have for example added a full one-third of the known frog and other amphibian species to bring the current total to 5400 and more continue to pour in 
two new kinds of whales have been discovered along with two new antelopes dozens of monkey species and a new kind of elephant -- and even a distinct kind of gorilla 
consider the nematode roundworm the most abundant of all animals 
but that number of bacteria species can be found in one gram of soil just a little handful of soil in the 10 billion bacteria that would be there 
my own epiphany as a conservationist came in 1953 while a harvard graduate student searching for rare ants found in the mountain forests of cuba ants that shine in the sunlight -- metallic green or metallic blue according to species and one species i discovered metallic gold 
and the final letter is o for over-harvesting -- driving species into extinction by excessive hunting and fishing 
that's in the united states 
but what excites me is that since i first put forward this particular idea in that form science has advanced 
i wish you would help them 
the encyclopedia will quickly pay for itself in practical applications 
the idea that in that room at that moment everyone regardless of their age their gender their race their color their religion comes together 
let's start with technology 
all right let's start with theater 
but the teachers came to me afterward and told me they hadn't seen the kids that attentive 
zero does not speak is neither man nor woman 
and that usually if you're a bit extraordinary if you're not exactly of human appearance then people will feel inclined to participate and to feel out loud 
i've worked as a doctor clown in a hospital for two years 
it's a human and technological revolution 
and well of course the dutch can't eat all these pigs 
and what i was curious about -- because historically the whole pig would be used up until the last bit so nothing would be wasted -- and i was curious to find out if this was actually still the case 
and in cheesecake and all kinds of desserts like chocolate mousse tiramisu vanilla pudding everything that's cooled in the supermarket there's gelatin to make it look good 
fine bone china -- this is a real classic 
i was not planning on showing you any meat because of course half the book's meat and you probably all know what meats they are 
and the reason for this is that pigs are actually quite close to human beings so the collagen is as well 
and they said well the director of the company decided not to let you borrow this heart valve because want his product to be associated with pigs 
well it is because everything that can't be used for anything else is made into a fuel that can be used as renewable energy source 
this is a picture of maurice druon the honorary perpetual secretary of l'academie francaise the french academy 
we see it in the constant appearance of slang and jargon of the historical change in languages in divergence of dialects and the formation of new languages 
the problem is which verbs go in which constructions 
a transitive verb mandates that there has to be an object there sam devoured the pizza you can't just say sam devoured 
there are dozens or scores of verbs of this type each of which shapes its sentence 
first there's a level of fine-grained conceptual structure which we automatically and unconsciously compute every time we produce or utter a sentence that governs our use of language 
or the meeting went from three to four in which we conceive of time as stretched along a line 
or rose forced herself to go as if there were two entities inside rose's head engaged in a tug of a war 
and i'll start out with a puzzle the puzzle of indirect speech acts 
for example in brotherhoods fraternal organizations sororities locutions like the family of man you try to get people who are not related to use the relationship type that would ordinarily be appropriate to close kin 
in that case the consequences are rather severe 
on the other hand if you extend the bribe if the officer is dishonest you get a huge payoff of going free 
the honest officer can't hold you to it as being a bribe and therefore you get the nuisance of the traffic ticket 
because i get to talk about one of my favorite critters which is the western grebe you haven't lived until you've seen these guys do their courtship dance 
what they said to us at first was you know we already do biomimicry 
and they said you know what happens is mineral -- just like at your house -- mineral builds up 
so if we had some way to stop this scaling -- and so i picked up some shells on the beach and i asked them what is scaling what's inside your pipes 
and they didn't know that 
you know it's a silo people in silos they didn't know that the same thing was happening so one of them thought about it and said ok well if this is just crystallization that happens automatically out of seawater -- self-assembly -- then why aren't shells infinite in size what stops the scaling 
how do we redesign the world that we make the human-made world 
and there's a lot of cool technologies out there that life has 
what's the syllabus 
and thirdly how does life make things disappear into systems 
and at the same time i'm listening to a lot of businesses and finding what their sort of grand challenges are 
on the lower left there is a picture of mother of pearl forming out of seawater it's a layered structure that's mineral and then polymer and it makes it very very tough 
here are two organisms that pull water 
pulling water out of monterey fog and out of the sweaty air in atlanta before it gets into a building are key technologies 
green chemistry is replacing our industrial chemistry with nature's recipe book 
that little guy over there is a tardigrade 
there is a problem with vaccines around the world not getting to patients and the reason is that the refrigeration somehow gets broken what's called the cold chain gets broken 
they can be put in a glove compartment ok 
chris anderson talk about foreplay i -- we need to get to 12 but really quickly 
ok so that's the healing one 
and really that's what other organisms do as well 
that's the twelfth one 
and i saw from a young age that having a decent job and earning a good living made the biggest difference for families who were struggling 
i mean here was a girl who had never lived in peace time who somehow had come to sound like a candidate from the apprentice 
my first business was a dressmaking business i started under the taliban 
the imf official is hardly the only person to automatically file women under micro 
and in many places they're there 
because -- and i say this as somebody who worked in finance -- 500 billion dollars at least has gone into the emerging markets in the past decade 
just think of the benefits when it comes to jobs productivity employment child nutrition maternal mortality literacy and much much more 
and not one country in all the world has eliminated its economic participation gap -- not one 
the women in my family are not exceptions 
the women in this room and watching in la 
together we can make certain that the so-called exceptions begin to rule 
once upon a time in 19th century germany there was the book 
now during this time the book was the king of storytelling 
his name was lothar lothar meggendorfer 
this man refused to fold to the conventions of normalcy and just decided to fold 
whether storytellers realized it or not they were channeling meggendorfer's spirit when they moved opera to vaudville radio news to radio theater film to film in motion to film in sound color 3d on vhs and on dvd 
and i really want to build green but i'm very suspicious of all of these well-meaning articles people long on moral authority and short on data telling me how to do these kinds of things 
wipe it up throw it away 
unless i use a front-loading high-efficiency washing machine  and then it looks a little bit better 
so what this says is that sometimes the things that you least expect -- the position in which you put the handle -- have a bigger effect than any of those other things that you were trying to optimize 
we wanted to know how much better we could do 
now pvc is a little bit better but still not as good as the wood that we chose 
when it comes time to sheetrock if you use ecorock it's about a quarter of the embodied energy of standard sheetrock 
if you put carpeting in your house it's about a tenth of the embodied energy of the entire house unless you use concrete or wood for a much lower embodied energy 
so now we add in the final construction energy we add it all up and we've built a house for less than half of the typical embodied energy for building a house like this 
now i probably would have upgraded the old house to be more energy-efficient and in that case it would take me more about 20 years to break even 
so what does this mean 
you might want to leave now 
so i did 
and i'm talking specifically about synanthropic species which are species that have adapted specifically for human ecologies species like rats and cockroaches and crows 
so for example rats are incredibly responsive breeders 
we're seeing a population boom with crows 
and i'll give you an example of that 
and these crows use sticks in the wild to get insects and whatnot out of pieces of wood 
they messed up and left just a stick of wire in there 
so what's significant about this isn't that crows are using cars to crack nuts 
and as we heard yesterday that's the pandora's box that's getting human beings in trouble and we're starting to see it with them 
now they're used to the sound of the machine and they keep coming back and digging out these peanuts from amongst the pile of coins that's there 
the main thing the main point of all this for me is that we can find mutually beneficial systems for these species 
so my grandfather told me when i was a little girl if you say a word often enough it becomes you 
anybody out here old enough to know studs terkel that old radio man 
the gradual slippage -- 'slippage' is the word used by the people in watergate moral slippage -- it's a gradual kind of thing combination of things 
oh let me kind of tell you a funny little play bit 
just as a train is about to go a young couple rush in and they're just about to close the pneumatic doors 
you see here's huck he's an illiterate kid he's had no schooling but there's something in him 
you know most actors want to do characters that are likeable -- well not always but the notion especially at a conference like this i like to inspire people 
and i still feel as though i've got to get coffee for my male colleagues even though i've outlived most of them 
everything i do is word for word off a tape 
and it didn't work didn't work 
all around her head was just swollen her head was about two sizes of its own size 
he says 'she won't breathe' i knew immediately that she was dead 
i didn't even want to accept the fact that she was dead so i went in and i put a mirror to her mouth -- there was no thing nothing coming out of her mouth 
he said he said he said 'we can't we can't let nobody find out about this' he say 'you've got to help me' i agree i agree 
and so i went to both -- two race riots one of which was the los angeles riot and this next piece is from that 
and that trial came back with two cops going to jail and two cops declared innocent i was at that trial 
so what she's questioning here she's taking a chance and questioning what justice is in society 
we didn't qualify for medical treatment no food stamp no gr no welfare anything many african-americans who never work got minimum amount of money to survive 
we didn't get any because we have a car and a house 
and i wonder if that is really justice for them to get their rights in that way 
but after the riot it's too much difference 
the other reason that i don't wear shoes is just in case i really feel like i have to cuddle up and get into the feet of somebody walking really in somebody else's shoes 
i was in a doctor's office last cat scan and there was a reader's digest october 2002 
i mean like even when i told my wife that you want to come out here and talk to me she's like 'she's just talking she's just being nice to you she's not going to do that' and then you called me up and you said you wanted to come out here and interview me and she went and looked you up on the internet 
she said 'look who she is 
freedom it would have to be the rodeo 
i mean i guess it just be like -- i guess it be like the day my brother died 
so check it i'm gonna to catch mockingbirds 
i'll get some asshole at a watering hole asking what brand the ice is 
i'll get the last time you lied 
i'll get a lonely little sentence with real error in it yeah i guess i could come inside but only for a minute 
what does a violin have to do with technology 
the surface of the earth is absolutely riddled with holes and here we are right in the middle 
i'm on this 'til the whole thing spreads with chat rooms and copycats and moms maybe tucking kids into bed singing hush little baby don't say a word 
wow 
now most media companies -- television radio publishing games you name it -- they use very rigid segmentation methods in order to understand their audiences 
and so the bizarre result of this is that most of our popular culture is actually based on these presumptions about our demographics 
now there's something else that we've discovered about social media that's actually quite surprising 
well i actually don't think that's going to be the case 
this is far too simplistic 
so you may be asking well why is it important that i know what entertains people 
so imagine a media atmosphere that isn't dominated by lame stereotypes about gender and other demographic characteristics 
thank you so much 
and she went to a neurologist who was fascinated 
and the amazing thing to me is that now you would think this woman would like have excellent oral hygiene 
i interviewed when i was working on the book i interviewed a woman who can think herself to orgasm 
it was remarkable it took about one minute 
and it is a fact that you can trigger spinal reflexes in dead people -- a certain kind of dead person a beating-heart cadaver 
obviously it wouldn't be as much fun for the person 
you know you can get cadavers if you work at a university 
according to 1930s marriage manual author theodoor van de velde a slight seminal odor can be detected on the breath of a woman within about an hour after sexual intercourse 
but he wrote in this book ideal marriage -- he said that he could differentiate between the semen of a young man which he said had a fresh exhilarating smell and the semen of mature men whose semen smelled quote remarkably like that of the flowers of the spanish chestnut 
and lo and behold the hiccups went away 
it was called the upsuck theory 
this is the 1950s 
i have an answer for you i have two answers 
so now you have an evolutionary excuse 
alrighty there is considerable evidence for upsuck in the animal kingdom -- pigs for instance 
and i also said to her now these sows i mean you may have noticed there the sow doesn't look to be in the throes of ecstasy 
this is the ejaculation face of the stump-tailed macaque 
this is basically a penis camera on a motor 
and in fact he found that in three quarters of the men the stuff just kind of slopped out 
and that furthers the isolation that people like john found themselves in 
but after having lost a beloved teacher in 2006 and a good friend last year to suicide and sitting last year at tedactive i knew that i needed to step out of my silence and past my taboos to talk about an idea worth spreading -- and that is that people who have made the difficult choice to come back to life need more resources and need our help 
this is the way that most of us were taught to tie our shoes 
and here's how to tell 
it will let you down less and not only that it looks better 
live long and prosper 
it's called tidying up art and it's as you can see it's more or less a picture book 
i'd like to show them around so we can just you know --  actually i managed to prepare for you some enlarged pictures -- even better 
and we can see here very clearly it's a confusion of color 
the various pictures here of the various elements of the picture -- the whole thing is unstructured 
yeah that's great 
you can see now that's a good example even behaving in an orderly systematic way can sometimes lead to complete chaos 
that's a picture by keith haring 
in the end one has a list with which one then can arrange 
tidying up rene magritte -- this is really fun 
like books clothes toothbrush etc and it was great 
but then one morning i hang the same little sign onto that picture by vincent van gogh 
here -- that's just my new proposal here for the union jack 
yeah i think after you have seen that i have to leave anyway 
one is hierarchical pores and the other is a macro-molecular nanoscale porosity in the material 
machines are becoming devastatingly capable of things like killing right 
those machines have no place for empathy 
which was the basis of the movie bladerunner 
even if you just try to get all of those ideas into your head by watching all those thousand ted videos it would actually currently take you over 250 hours to do so 
each of those tedtalks has an average length of about 2300 words 
or living in existential vacuum it sucks 
i mean  
for example dan pink's talk on motivation which was pretty good if you haven't seen it drop carrot drop stick bring meaning 
even then unfortunately it's not possible to summarize each tedtalk individually 
i don't know any tedtalk that contains this 
i had started out with a thousand tedtalks and i had 600 six-word summaries for those 
so i thought i probably have to take this one step further here and create summaries of the summaries -- and this is exactly what i did 
so he's discovering the garden 
his face by the way is fully ai-driven 
now we need to have a bit more engagement and again what we can do is we can look at the body 
you stand up and you skim the stone 
and we're going to help him with this now 
but this is going to be an introduction and this is all about the deep psychology that we're trying to use 
we're trying to introduce you to what i believe is the most wonderful part you being able to talk in your natural voice to milo 
he's just moved house he's got no friends 
they're always getting stressed 
milo i just really miss my old house that's all 
but for me this is a wonderful opportunity where technology at last can be connected with where i am no longer restrained by the finger i hold in my hand -- as far as a computer game's concerned -- or by the blandness of not being noticed if you're watching a film or a book 
each of you possesses the most powerful dangerous and subversive trait that natural selection has ever devised 
i'm talking about your language of course because it allows you to implant a thought from your mind directly into someone else's mind and they can attempt to do the same to you without either of you having to perform surgery 
and just imagine the sense of wonder in a baby when it first discovers that merely by uttering a sound it can get objects to move across a room as if by magic and maybe even into its mouth 
and this cumulative cultural adaptation as anthropologists call this accumulation of ideas is responsible for everything around you in your bustling and teeming everyday lives 
and this is also true of some remote oceanic islands 
this remarkable image is not a map of the world 
he thought oh i can renovate the school 
she found a job she scouted for jobs for her classmates and her friends 
she not only changed her own dynamic she changed her household she changed her family her village 
and that is that the central moral challenge of this century is gender inequity 
so some of you may be thinking gosh that's hyperbole 
and you know it happens for several reasons 
there are three reasons why this is the case 
when you educate a girl she tends to have significantly fewer kids 
it's kind of like the dirty little secret of poverty which is that not only do poor people take in very little income but also the income that they take in they don't spend it very wisely and unfortunately most of that spending is done by men 
the last reason has to do with women being part of the solution not the problem 
he was speaking to an audience much like yourselves 
and that does not even include those that are trafficked within country borders which is a substantial portion 
she fought off the hyenas with that stick 
she's moved out of a vicious cycle and into a virtuous cycle 
let me tell you about saima 
and then when she had to transport all of the embroidery goods from the village to the marketplace she needed someone to help her do the transport so she hired her husband 
a few yards away was a failed chicken coop 
she never broke down 
so here's the cause 
join the movement 
you've all seen lots of articles on climate change and here's yet another new york times article just like every other darn one you've seen 
and we've accomplished close to zip 
and there are times you might like to do something quick 
can you shade some sunlight and effectively compensate for the added co2 and produce a climate sort of back to what it was originally 
and the answer seems to be yes 
it just sunk below the surface we weren't allowed to speak about it 
and in fact he had some ideas to make them go away 
but let's say you have sunlight hitting some particle and it's unevenly heated 
so the side facing the sun is warmer the side away cooler 
and so you see a net force away from the sun 
because we have no way to agree about where to set the knobs 
we need a broader debate 
let's say that we don't do geo-engineering we do what we ought to do which is get serious about cutting emissions 
but i have a lot of reservations 
and it's time to begin thinking about it even if the reason we're thinking about it is to construct arguments for why we shouldn't do it 
and oddly the most notable letter of rejection i ever received came from walt disney world a seemingly innocuous site 
and i wanted to see the center with my own eyes but what i came away with is a photograph 
and it's just another place from which to observe and the understanding that there are no absolute all-knowing insiders 
in this context i'll just show you a few 
this is a cryopreservation unit and it holds the bodies of the wife and mother of cryonics pioneer robert ettinger who hoped to be awoken one day to extended life in good health with advancements in science and technology all for the cost of 35 thousand dollars for forever 
and in this i really wanted it to resemble an early still-life painting so i spent some time with the smells and items 
and the film was shot on 72 millimeter government-issue film 
i investigate photography's ability to blur truth and fiction and its influence on memory which can lead to severe even lethal consequences 
a victim or eyewitness identifies a suspected perpetrator through law enforcement's use of images 
but through exposure to composite sketches polaroids mug shots and line-ups eyewitness testimony can change 
and he served 10 years of a life sentence 
ron williamson ron was convicted of the rape and murder of a barmaid at a club and served 11 years of a death sentence 
ronald jones served eight years of a death sentence for rape and murder of a 28-year-old woman 
some people say this is because we have better diagnosis and more people are being found out 
for example these two show great growth in income absolutely flat happiness curves 
my field the field of psychology hasn't done a whole lot to help us move forward in understanding human happiness 
emotions are short-lived intense responses to challenge and to opportunity 
and each one of them allows us to click into alternate selves that tune in turn on drop out thoughts perceptions feelings and memories 
we've come away from the freudian gloom and people are now actively studying this 
absent from this list and absent from any discussions of happiness are happiness in another's happiness 
babies love the taste of sweet and hate the taste of bitter 
babies really are born with a lot of innate pleasures 
it turned out that it wasn't that it really is a system of motivation a system of wanting 
there is a profound need to belong 
but there are ways in which our evolutionary history can really trip us up 
so for example we have three systems that underlie reproduction because it's so important 
there's attachment which is oxytocin and the opiates which says this is a long-term bond 
so a person can be in a long term attachment become romantically infatuated with someone else and want to have sex with a third person 
so if you look at questions like this life satisfaction you see life satisfaction going up with each rung of income 
you see mental distress going up with lower income 
but the effect is relatively small 
and sure enough if you look at the kinds of values that come in you see wealth adventure achievement pleasure fun be respected before the change and much more post-materialist values after 
i had all kinds of rats mice hamsters gerbils squirrels 
growing up in a multicultural environment we had african students in the house and i learned about their stories so different backgrounds dependency on imported know-how goods services exuberant cultural diversity 
princess diana is announcing on tv that landmines form a structural barrier to any development which is really true 
and actually our product -- what you see here 
rats have been used since the '50s last century in all kinds of experiments 
rats have more genetic material allocated to olfaction than any other mammal species 
so in our common language dutch the name for tb 
it gets a click sound and comes for the food reward 
and by doing so very fast we can have like a second-line opinion to see which patients are positive which are negative 
just as an indication whereas a microscopist can process 40 samples in a day a rat can process the same amount of samples in seven minutes only 
but let's stick first to tuberculosis 
throughout last year we've been -- depending on which intervals you take -- we've been consistently increasing case detection rates in five hospitals in dar es salaam between 30 and 40 percent 
and there are simple things like for instance we have a small laser in the sniffer hole where the animal has to stick for five seconds 
also to standardize the pellets the food rewards and to semi-automate this in order to replicate this on a much larger scale and affect the lives of many more people 
here is a first prototype of our camera rat which is a rat with a rat backpack with a camera that can go under rubble to detect for victims after earthquake and so on 
thank you very much 
so how do you go about studying the brain 
now one recent discovery that has been made by researchers in italy in parma by giacomo rizzolatti and his colleagues is a group of neurons called mirror neurons which are on the front of the brain in the frontal lobes 
so here is a neuron that fires when i reach and grab something but it also fires when i watch joe reaching and grabbing something 
it's almost as though it's performing a virtual reality simulation of the other person's action 
for one thing they must be involved in things like imitation and emulation 
so how do you do imitation why is imitation important 
and i claim that what happened was the sudden emergence of a sophisticated mirror neuron system which allowed you to emulate and imitate other people's actions 
a human being a child can just watch its parent kill another polar bear and skin it and put the skin on its body fur on the body and learn it in one step what the polar bear took 100000 years to learn it can learn in five minutes maybe 10 minutes 
it emerges from our understanding of basic neuroscience 
for the longest time people have regarded science and humanities as being distinct 
pollen is a flower's way of making more flowers 
here is a scanning electron micrograph of a grain of pollen 
the little hole in the middle we'll come to a bit later but that's for the pollen tube to come out later on a very tiny tube 
so that's 20 micrometers across that pollen grain there 
it's also very biologically active as anyone with hay fever will understand 
and the reason for that is they've got to chuck out masses and masses of pollen to have any chance of the pollen reaching another plant of the same species 
again -- this time sycamore -- wind-dispersed 
cool pollen though 
remember that thing is just about 30 micrometers across 
now it's much more efficient if you can get insects to do your bidding 
the pollen has little barbs on it if we look 
that tells me that it's actually been fossilized this pollen 
isn't that cool 
and this is where it gets interesting for forensics 
so not only does each type of pollen look different but each habitat has a different combination of plants 
this is some pollen embedded in a cotton shirt similar to the one that i'm wearing now 
and that is the 40 years that women have advocated 
we have effective therapies now 
why are more and more women dying of ischemic heart disease 
so in the wise 15 years ago we started out and said well wow there's a couple of key observations and we should probably follow up on that 
had recently published that when women have heart attacks and die compared to men who have heart attacks and die -- and again this is millions of people happening every day -- women in their fatty plaque -- and this is their coronary artery so the main blood supply going into the heart muscle -- women erode men explode 
ekg goes pbbrrhh so the doctors can see this hugely abnormal ekg 
so what do you think happens to these gals 
so unlike the cat scans x-rays thalliums for women whose breast is in the way of looking at the heart every time we order something that has even a small amount of radiation we say do we really need that test 
and those little red boxes are deaths 
one of the things that we say about all of this female physiology -- because again as much as we're talking about women and heart disease women do on average have better longevity than men -- is that unfolding the secrets of female physiology and understanding that is going to help men and women 
so we're 35 years behind 
women participate 
deb roy this moment and thousands of other moments special for us were captured in our home because in every room in the house if you looked up you'd see a camera and a microphone and if you looked down you'd get this bird's-eye view of the room 
this is my wife and i cooking breakfast in the kitchen and as we move through space and through time a very everyday pattern of life in the kitchen 
in order to convert this opaque 90000 hours of video into something that we could start to see we use motion analysis to pull out as we move through space and through time what we call space-time worms 
no video here so you can focus on the sound the acoustics of a new kind of trajectory gaga to water 
this is one of the first results that came out of our study a little over a year ago that really surprised us 
so it appears that all three primary caregivers -- myself my wife and our nanny -- were systematically and i would think subconsciously restructuring our language to meet him at the birth of a word and bring him gently into more complex language 
what about the visual context 
and there's our nanny by the door 
and what we've done is use the word water to tag that moment that bit of activity 
three of the key people in this project philip decamp rony kubat and brandon roy are pictured here 
each of the links that you're seeing rendered here is an actual connection made between something someone said and a piece of content 
we call this a co-viewing clique a virtual living room if you will 
and there are fascinating dynamics at play 
so this person is a key link in connecting mass media and social media together 
come here 
oh boy 
and primary visual cortex sees just simple geometry just the simplest of shapes 
and this is the part of the brain that will recognize what something is 
you'd be activating the dorsal stream if you did that 
and it's the part that feels 
now we've augmented this and spatialized this information 
we make meaning by seeing by an act of visual interrogation 
this is a time-lapse view of it 
and this is an emerging set of technologies that use large-screen displays with intelligent calculation in the background to make the invisible visible 
you can see the three-light transom there with the eyebrow windows -- certainly an architectural antique headed to the landfill 
even the lockset is probably worth 200 dollars 
then looking up in the turret you see there are bulges and pokes and sags and so forth 
then on the can it says this is the famous budweiser beer we know of no other beer blah blah blah 
this little house here those branches there are made out of bois d'arc or osage orange and these pictures will keep scrolling as i talk a little bit 
that's one of those new chocolate cell phones 
it only rattles that expected pattern and unity of structural features 
on the one hand we have an apollonian perspective which is very crisp and premeditated and intellectualized and perfect 
the dionysian personality takes the picture and goes  
oops scratch dumpster 
and here's a story jim tulles one of the guys i trained i said jim it's time now 
jim now it's time you're the down oh 
good call tulles from now on you guys hit this pile first 
but once in a while you get access to the control room and then you can kind of mess with the dials 
how disgusting 
it's a pretty quick read 
but as soon as you walk in i go ooh spaghetti sauce there 
i feel that expectation and so i accommodate it and i'm living my life according to what you expect me to do 
wildebeests don't hang with lions because lions eat wildebeests 
and so you see this in junior high a lot 
on the bottom tier we have basic needs -- shelter clothing food water mating and so forth 
we can't even afford to eat anything except beans 
we're in trouble 
and it raises an existential question which is if i'm having this experience of complete connection and full consciousness why am i not visible in the photograph and where is this time and place 
this is a police photo that's actually my car 
i'm put on full life support and i have a massive stroke and my brain drops into a coma 
and this is how we began 
now you also continue to watch as consciousness evolved to the point that here in india in madhya pradesh there's one of the two oldest known pieces of rock art found 
while i was producing in los angeles i never thought about it for a second 
here's my brain 
and this person is particularly interesting 
the craniomandibular system is critical to that 
if that sounds like a very very strange thing to say and rather a bold statement -- how can the jaw affect the entire body -- let me simply point out to you if i ask you tomorrow to put one grain of sand between your teeth and go for a nice long walk how far would you last before you had to remove that grain of sand 
that tiny misalignment 
bear in mind there are no nerves in the teeth 
that's why the same between the before and after that this shows it's hard to see the difference 
this is an mri mra mrv a volumetric mri 
i've brought with me from southern california the fm device 
and when i came out of my coma i recognized my family but i didn't remember my own past 
and i whispered the good news through my broken jaw which was wired shut to my night nurse 
and during my time in coma she had been laid to rest in her hometown of phoenix 
you know when i heard simon's -- please sit down i just want to talk to him for a second -- when i read his book i went to la to meet him 
the thing that amazed me is the painstaking detail with which he has written every hospital he has been to every treatment he got every near-miss he had and how accidentally he stumbled upon innovations 
tell a little bit about what you're wearing on your leg 
because the chimpanzee would score half right if i gave them two bananas with sri lanka and turkey they would be right half of the cases 
i did also an unethical study of the professors of the karolinska institute  -- that hands out the nobel prize in medicine and they are on par with the chimpanzee there 
well i first discovered that the textbook was tintin mainly 
and what do you mean with western world i said 
and 1962 there was really a group of countries here that was industrialized countries and they had small families and long lives 
one dollar 10 dollars or 100 dollars per day 
there's a little hump here but there are people all the way 
we heard it in other forms and who are these 
where are the different countries i can show you africa 
the problem in the world was the poverty in asia and if i now let the world move forward you will see that while population increase there are hundreds of millions in asia getting out of poverty and some others getting into poverty and this is the pattern we have today 
i can go here and i can split sub-saharan africa into its countries 
and when it burst the size of its country bubble is the size of the population 
today we don't have to go to cuba to find a healthy country in latin america 
the richest 20 percent of ugandans are there 
and we started to write software which could link the data like this 
so i first went to copenhagen because i thought well maybe i could become a biochemist but i discovered biochemistry was very boring 
but wilkins you know thought dna was the best bet and he showed this x-ray photograph 
and there i met francis crick 
i went there without knowing him he was 35 i was 23 
and within a day we had decided that maybe we could take a shortcut to finding the structure of dna 
and the reason for doing so at the center of this photograph is linus pauling about six months before he proposed the alpha helical structure for proteins and in doing so he banished the man out on the right sir lawrence bragg who was the cavendish professor 
this is a photograph several years later when bragg had cause to smile 
and they had the wisdom to say no so he didn't have it 
but there was ones in the literature 
so this was you know unexpected from the world's --  -- and so it was held together by hydrogen bonds between phosphate groups 
and a month after we got the pauling manuscript -- i should say i took the manuscript to london and showed the people 
well we got the answer on the 28th february '53 
so i changed the locations and then we found the base pairing and francis immediately said the chains run in absolute directions 
so we saw how genetic information is carried 
it didn't yield it didn't give good x-ray photographs 
it was really you know sort of a shitty time 
well at that time -- i should go back 
and then they learned how to read the letters for the code 
there's a chip there a conventional one then there's one made by a photolithography by a company in madison called nimblegen which is way ahead of affymetrix 
and we use their technique 
which is all of us have about 10 places in our genome where we've lost a gene or gained another one 
actually it's a really big idea 
and they were going to spend the rest of their lives usually in this iron lung to breathe for them 
and it happened so fast in the united states however that even just last month jon stewart said this  jon stewart where is polio still active 
they had come from thousands of miles away 
it doesn't survive in the environment hardly at all 
and we've got pretty good vaccines as i've just showed you 
so those are the kind of stakes that we're after 
so it was a massive effort 
we've had to create one of the largest social movements in history 
now giving the polio vaccine is simple 
now it took years to build up the infrastructure for polio eradication -- more than 15 years much longer than it should have -- but once it was built the results were striking 
last year it was 1000 
we should abandon this idea of eradication 
let's settle for control -- that's good enough 
umar was paralyzed for life 
as you probably can't see the detail here but this is his report card and you'll see he's got perfect scores 
but you know i'd love to be able to tell you that umar is a typical kid with polio these days but it's not true 
the new vaccine had twice the impact on these last couple of viruses as the old vaccine had and we immediately started using this 
well in a couple of months we had to get it out of production 
and we didn't start with the easy places 
so this morning at about seven o'clock i decided that we'd try to drive chris and the production crew here berserk by downloading all of our data from india again so that you could see something that's just unfolding today which proves that the impossible is possible 
today marks exactly six months -- and for the first time in history not a single child has been paralyzed in uttar pradesh or bihar 
we have the chance to write an entirely new polio-free chapter in human history 
beverly joubert we are truly passionate about the african wilderness and protecting the african wilderness and so what we've done is we've focused on iconic cats 
but one of the things that science really lets us down on is that personality that individual personality that these animals have 
well we needn't have worried 
and we could only find this by pushing ourselves by going where no sane person should go -- not without some prompting by the way from beverly -- and just pushing the envelope going out there pushing our vehicle pushing ourselves 
we don't always get that right and on this particular day we seriously underestimated the depth 
but that's i think what this is all about is that these individuals have these personalities and characters 
sleep deprivation is extreme 
but for 10 years we tried to capture lions and elephants together -- and never ever managed until this particular night 
this elephant against overwhelming odds simply gives up hope 
but by the same token you can get your hope back again 
beverly sits on the one side where all her camera gear is and i'm on the other side where my space is 
these are precious to us these divides 
but when this little cub saw that i had vacated my seat and climbed to the back to get some camera gear she came in like a curious cat to come and investigate 
and of course we knew now that she was going to survive 
it was absolutely amazing when she picked it up to safety protecting it from the hyena 
but i have to tell you -- everybody always asks what happened to the baby baboon 
we had to deal with these individual personalities 
there's an immense amount of poaching as well and so possibly the same amount 
richard feynman compared the accuracy of quantum theories -- experimental predictions -- to specifying the width of north america to within one hair's breadth of accuracy 
and the familiar illustration is the nucleus of an atom is a fly in the middle of a sports stadium and the next atom is in the next sports stadium 
as an evolutionary biologist i'd say this our brains have evolved to help us survive within the orders of magnitude of size and speed which our bodies operate at we never evolved to navigate in the world of atoms 
moving to the other end of the scale our ancestors never had to navigate through the cosmos at speeds close to the speed of light if they had our brains would be much better at understanding einstein i want to give the name middle world to the medium-scaled environment in which we've evolved the ability to take act -- nothing to do with middle earth 
he stared at his wall in arlington virginia and decided to do it 
then general stubblebine banged his nose hard on the wall of his office stubblebine who commanded 16000 soldiers was confounded by his continual failure to walk through the wall 
i have every reason to think it's true i was reading playboy because i myself had an article in it  
and that's because in middle world air friction is always there 
we have this tendency to think that only solid material things are really things at all waves of electromagnetic fluctuation in a vacuum seem unreal 
steve grand points out that you and i are ourselves more like a wave than a permanent thing 
after all you really were there at the time weren't you 
not a single atom that is in your body today was there when that event took place matter flows from place to place and momentarily comes together to be you 
so really isn't a word that we should use with simple confidence 
the fact that the bat uses echoes in pitch darkness to input the current variables to its model while the swallow uses light is incidental 
haldane guesses that a dog would probably be able to place the acids in the order of their molecular weights by their smells just as a man could place a number of piano wires in the order of their lengths by means of their notes 
we're blind to all frequencies outside that unless we use instruments to help us 
one way to think about that is by counting planets 
in short when we're thinking like academics we regard people as elaborate and complicated machines like computers or cars but when we revert to being human we behave more like basil fawlty who we remember thrashed his car to teach it a lesson when it wouldn't start on gourmet night  
personification and the imputing of intentional purpose is such a brilliantly successful way to model humans it's hardly surprising the same modeling software often seizes control when we're trying to think about entities for which it's not appropriate like basil fawlty with his car or like millions of deluded people with the universe as a whole  
and so this basically led me to a subject called cymatics 
now cymatics is the process of visualizing sound by basically vibrating a medium such as sand or water as you can see there 
so what excites me about cymatics 
it's like a looking glass into a hidden world 
we can also use cymatics for healing and education 
this image here is created from a snippet of beethoven's ninth symphony playing through a cymatic device 
and we can evolve this exploration of the substance of things not seen thank you 
the war in vietnam was raging the civil rights movement was under way and pictures had a powerful influence on me 
i believed the photographers and so did millions of other americans 
[ 10308 -- the story breaks ] [ i have been a witness and these pictures are my testimony ] [ south africa ] [ this is happening now ] [ cambodia ] [ swaziland ] [ one person dies every 20 seconds ] [ thailand ] [ an ancient disease is taking on a deadly new form ] [ siberia ] [ lesotho ] [ tuberculosis the next pandemic ] [ india ] [ tb is preventable and curable ] [ but it is mutating due to inadequate treatment ] [ xdr-tb ] [ extreme drug resistant tuberculosis ] [ there is no reliable cure ] [ patients often die within weeks of diagnosis ] [ 49 countries have reported xdr-tb ] [ xdr-tb is a critical threat to global health ] [ extreme outbreak ] [ extreme suffering ] [ extreme affliction extreme loss extreme pain ] [ extreme pandemic ] [ extremely preventable ] [ xdr-tb ] [ we can stop this now ] [ spread the story stop the disease ] [ go to xdrtborg now ] [ xdrtborg we are the treatment ] [ we are the treatment ] [ made possible through the kind support of bd ] i'm an american which means generally i ignore football unless it involves guys my size or bruno's size running into each other at extremely high speeds 
narrator a word about galvao a very rare kind of bird native to brazil 
now most of you have figured out that this was a prank and actually a very very good one 
because what happens on a social network is you interact with the people that you have chosen to interact with 
and the reason it shouldn't be is that on any day you can go into trending topics 
now for me i'm surprised by this because this wasn't how the internet was supposed to be 
we're heading to the future of bits where everything is speedy it's weightless 
here's what i think is going on 
it includes things like the internet cables 
when we stop looking at the infrastructure that makes connection possible and we look at what actually happens we start realizing that the world doesn't work quite the same way that we think it does 
that's down to about 12 to 15 percent 
even within wikipedias where we're creating their own content online there's a heavy bias towards the place where a lot of the wikipedia authors are based rather than to the rest of the world 
you probably won't 
this is a team of bloggers from around the world 
but the more that i think about it the more that i think that a few things that we have learned along the way are interesting lessons for how we would rewire if we we wanted to use the web to have a wider world 
in this case -- the map of the world at night by nasa -- they're dark literally because of lack of electricity 
i'm also guessing that most of you don't even speak chinese -- which is sort of sad if you think about it as it's now the most represented language on the internet 
they put it online for free 
my guess is at least one of them has something interesting to say 
and search is terrific if you know what you're looking for 
she has to know something about what stories are available 
i know amira 
he knows one world and he's finding a way to communicate it to another world both of which he has deep connections to 
and the house that john wilkes booth planned the assassination of abraham lincoln is actually also now a chinese restaurant called wok 'n roll on h street in washington 
the short answer is actually they're from japan 
the original name in my book was actually called the long march of general tso and he has marched very far indeed because he is sweet he is fried and he is chicken -- all things that americans love 
he's retired deaf and plays a lot of mahjong 
but in china this guy's actually known for war and not chicken 
i like to say chop suey's the biggest culinary joke that one culture has ever played on another because chop suey if you translate into chinese means tsap sui which if you translate back means odds and ends 
now back then the americans were not clamoring to eat chinese food 
there is west indian chinese food there's jamaican chinese food there is middle eastern chinese food there's mauritian chinese food 
this is a dish called magic bowl that i discovered 
they actually did so through a centralized headquarters out of illinois right 
it wasn't that so they're like ok let's look at television so they looked at an episode of lost 
now i don't have a tv which makes me a freak but very productive and --  -- and this episode of lost i understand where the overweight guy has a lucky number which was not a lucky number which was how long they'd been on the island but they looked and the numbers did not match 
this actually is a slip that one of the winners had because the tennessee lottery security officials were like oh no -- like this can't be true 
yeah so i went and started looking 
it was lunch it was take-out it was sit-down it was buffet it was three weeks ago it was three months ago 
this time i'm going to talk about mental illness 
not only would it lift but it might never return 
that always makes hair stand up and people shake a lot 
so they went to the police and they said we know that at the rome railroad station there are all these lost souls wandering around muttering gibberish can you bring one of them to us 
that's not going to do anything terrible to him 
well you know in the middle '60s the first antidepressants came out tofranil was the first 
finally i would schedule -- all my major surgical cases i was scheduling them for 12 one o'clock in the afternoon because i couldn't get out of bed before about 11 o'clock 
and my colleagues who had known me since medical school in that place said don't worry chap six weeks you're back in the operating room everything's going to be great 
you've seen this painting by edvard munch the scream every moment was a scream 
well as in all hospitals there was a resident assigned to my case he was 27 years old and he would meet with me two or three times a week 
any of the results along the spectrum from pretty bad to terrible terrible terrible is going to happen if he does the best he can he will have no further obsessions probably no depression but his affect will be dulled he will never go back to surgery he will never be the loving father that he was to his two children his life will be changed if he has the usual result he will end up like 'one flew over the cuckoo's nest' and you know about that just essentially in a stupor the rest of his life 
plugged me into the wires put me to sleep gave me the muscle relaxant 
but lo and behold by 16 by 17 there were demonstrable differences in the way i felt 
it was as though those tightly coiled wires in my head had been disconnected and i could think clearly 
my children came back to live with us 
we had two more children after that 
it's been as i said close to 30 years 
every once in a while i get somewhat depressed and a little obsessional 
and i've always felt guilty about that 
i hope it happens to none of you but it will probably happen to a small percentage of you 
would you describe that as global citizenship 
i believe the concept of global citizenship will simply grow out of people talking to each other across continents 
but people get excited about this idea of global citizenship but then they get confused a bit again when they start thinking about patriotism and how to combine these two 
when you actually look at the motor of the world economy it cannot move forward unless there is trade between the different countries 
well i think we can persuade people that what is necessary for britain's long-term interests what is necessary for america's long-term interests is proper engagement with the rest of the world and taking the action that is necessary 
and we have got to realize that if we don't link up with those people who are sensible voices and democratic voices in africa to work together for common causes then the danger of al qaeda and related groups making progress in africa is very big 
and i wouldn't like anything that is said today to suggest that i am diminishing the importance of the responsibility that each individual leader has for their own country 
where was the early warning systems 
all these things have happened 
even if as a human being you believe that you can't say that you're elected for britain's interests 
since then the world has moved forward partly as a result of what happened with the holocaust and people's concern about the rights of individuals within territories where they need protection partly because of what we saw in rwanda partly because of what we saw in bosnia 
the idea of the responsibility to protect all individuals who are in situations where they are at humanitarian risk is now being established as a principle which governs the world 
so while i can't automatically say that britain will rush to the aid of any citizen of any country in danger i can say that britain is in a position where we're working with other countries so that this idea that you have a responsibility to protect people who are victims of either genocide or humanitarian attack is something that is accepted by the whole world 
yes and then of course the theory is still that those talks get rent apart by different countries fighting over their own individual interests 
america has made its first disposition on this with the bill that president obama should be congratulated for getting through congress 
and god shook his head and said not this year not this decade perhaps not even in your lifetime 
and bill clinton walked away in tears because he had failed to get what he wanted 
so that's kind of a bold statement 
and it's technological so it can do things like microelectronics and maybe photonics do 
and the material looks something like this 
the process of discovery generally is inspired by nature 
they find their way to self-assemble 
and we can store information that's film with water and protein 
you can imagine that then maybe you can use a pure protein to guide light and so we've made optical fibers 
you can do electronic pieces that fold and wrap 
you can implant it in the body without needing to retrieve what is implanted 
and you see there it gets reintegrated in tissue 
so you have a clock you have protein and now a silk cup like this can be thrown away without guilt --  unlike the polystyrene cups that unfortunately fill our landfills everyday 
so it allows for the recovery of what we've stored before 
some people in the last decade or two have started creating artwork with technology 
you can learn something from the robot about the community that you're in 
you guys are looking good out there 
data here's the first one 
one of them falls to the ground 
i can help 
you've been a great audience 
there's a lot more to come 
then he said but really sarah you could have worked harder can't you see it's really too small 
indeed it's rather small 
one day while my father was working on a file for us to obtain french nationality i happened to see some documents that caught my attention 
these are real 
so his story my father was born in argentina 
this coincided with the time when he threw himself body and soul into chemistry because it was the only consolation for his sadness 
it was my grandfather who decided they needed false documents 
but it was he who went to meet a man from the resistance 
in those times documents had hard covers they were filled in by hand and they stated your job 
he started inventing all kind of things -- with some materials he invented a centrifuge using a bicycle wheel 
time passed and they thought he had surely forgotten them at first 
and then i understood that asking my father so many questions was stirring up a whole past he probably didn't feel like talking about because it was painful 
in africa there were countries fighting for their independence guinea guinea-bissau angola 
there was also latin america 
he said no 
we live on a human-dominated planet putting unprecedented pressure on the systems on earth 
this is a scientific journey on the challenges facing humanity in the global phase of sustainability 
so i thought i'd bring her with me today on stage to have her as a witness of a remarkable journey which humbly reminds us of the period of grace we've had over the past 10000 years 
here used as a proxy temperature variability 
it was a jumpy ride 80000 years back in a crisis we leave africa we colonize australia in another crisis 60000 years back we leave asia for europe in another crisis 40000 years back and then we enter the remarkably stable holocene phase the only period in the whole history of the planet that we know of that can support human development 
the majority of the planet aspiring for development having the right for development are in large aspiring for an unsustainable lifestyle a momentous pressure 
now you would have wished the climate pressure to hit a strong planet a resilient planet but unfortunately the third pressure is the ecosystem decline 
now if we have evidence which we now have that wetlands forests [unclear] monsoon system the rainforests behave in this nonlinear way 
and could we even thanks to major advancements in earth systems science identify the thresholds the points where we may expect nonlinear change 
now this is the big bang equivalent then of human development within the safe operating space of the planetary boundaries 
in the '60s already through the green revolution and the haber-bosch process of fixing nitrogen from the atmosphere -- you know human's today take out more nitrogen from the atmosphere than the whole biosphere does naturally as a whole 
there's good news here for example from latin america where plow-based farming systems of the '50s and '60s led farming basically to a dead-end with lower and lower yields degrading the organic matter and fundamental problems at the livelihood levels in paraguay uruguay and a number of countries brazil leading to innovation and entrepreneurship among farmers in partnership with scientists into an agricultural revolution of zero tillage systems combined with mulch farming with locally adapted technologies which today for example in some countries have led to a tremendous increase in area under mulch zero till farming which not only produces more food but also sequesters carbon 
it has to basically do this on current land 
elinor ostrom the latest nobel laureate of economics clearly shows empirically across the world that we can govern the commons if we invest in trust local action-based partnerships and cross-scale institutional innovations where local actors together can deal with the global commons at a large scale 
where you give the guaranteed price for investment in renewable energy but you can subsidize electricity to poor people 
so there is scientific evidence 
i was asked to come here and speak about creation 
you know creation is what put that dog in that picture and creativity is what makes us see a chicken on his hindquarters 
and another point -- why i'm here -- is that the day i went to pick up the plexiglas trophy i rented a tuxedo for the first time in my life picked the thing -- didn't have any friends 
somebody was hitting somebody else with brass knuckles 
and that's how -- with this money i paid for a ticket to come to the united states in 1983 and that's very -- the basic reason i'm talking to you here today because i got shot   
unfortunately it has become obsolete because it was designed for atari platform 
but i was still you know -- this is a kitty cloud 
the snail 
and your eye doesn't know which level to read 
and they would look at it -- ah it's a pencil drawing 
it had a physicality and you start going deeper and deeper into sort of narrative that goes this way towards the image so this is monkey with leica 
and i wanted to deal with other subjects 
i got some photographs from them 
and jackson pollock also 
i used the dust at the whitney museum to render some pieces of their collection 
and i picked minimalist pieces because they're about specificity 
they do a dna scan of this they will come up with a great mailing list 
also the reference to gerhard richter's use of color charts -- and the idea also entering another realm of representation that's very common to us today which is the bit map 
i opt for very simple line drawings -- kind of stupid looking 
on the other hand you know i paid like three dollars i think -- and i went to a warehouse in queens to see a version of othello by an amateur group 
that's why we pay to go to magic shows and things like that 
and the information is there twice -- one on each strand -- which is important because when new cells are formed these strands come apart new strands are synthesized with the old ones as templates in an almost perfect process 
so an interesting question is what happened when we met 
so this involves a lot of technical issues in how you extract the dna how you convert it to a form you can sequence 
the same is true if we look at a chinese individual versus an african the neanderthal will match the chinese individual more often 
and further back 800000 years ago is there a common origin with present day humans 
but we do find it in papua new guinea and in other islands in melanesia and the pacific 
we don't know quite where the borders between these people were but we know that in southern siberia there were both neanderthals and denisovans at least at some time in the past 
and since we mixed elsewhere i'm pretty sure that one day when we will perhaps have a genome of also these earlier forms in africa we will find that they have also mixed with early modern humans in africa 
and if i were to write a volume it would be called artists who have led my exhibitions because my work in understanding art and in understanding culture has come by following artists by looking at what artists mean and what they do and who they are 
my overall project is about art -- specifically about black artists -- very generally about the way in which art can change the way we think about culture and ourselves 
what that might mean for cultural movements all over this moment the me we seems incredibly prescient totally important 
to this end the specific project that has made this possible for me is a series of exhibitions all titled with an f -- freestyle frequency and flow -- which have set out to discover and define the young black artists working in this moment who i feel strongly will continue to work over the next many years 
it is really in this sense of discovery that i have a new set of questions that i'm asking 
but really it has been what i've discovered about myself and what i can offer in the space of an exhibition to talk about beauty to talk about power to talk about ourselves and to talk and speak to each other 
and you put on the t-10 parachute 
they give 20 minutes -- that's a time warning 
and that's to boost everybody's confidence to show that you're not scared 
then they give you get ready 
so nice air comes flowing in 
so then you look around you're under a canopy and you say this is good 
in 30-some years of jumping i never did one 
and i realized that if they had to go into combat they would do what we had taught them and they would follow leaders 
so now i do that tuesday morning jump but it's not any jump -- that was september 11th 2001 
sort of leadership by humiliation 
i've got to use video teleconferences i've got to use chat i've got to use email i've got to use phone calls -- i've got to use everything i can not just for communication but for leadership 
and that's a new kind of leadership for me 
so we had to get complex intelligence together we had to line up the ability to act 
in reality much of the force i led looked exactly like you 
and so instead of giving orders you're now building consensus and you're building a sense of shared purpose 
it also produced something which i call an inversion of expertise because we had so many changes at the lower levels in technology and tactics and whatnot that suddenly the things that we grew up doing wasn't what the force was doing anymore 
and it's a brand new leadership challenge 
and every morning in the ranger regiment every ranger -- and there are more than 2000 of them -- says a six-stanza ranger creed 
and so the organizational relationship that bonds them is just amazing 
that was my journey 
i came to believe that a leader isn't good because they're right they're good because they're willing to learn and to trust 
alex steffen and i founded worldchanging in late 2003 and since then we and our growing global team of contributors have documented the ever-expanding variety of solutions that are out there right now and on the near horizon 
as norwegian social scientist evelin lindner has observed pessimism is a luxury of good times  
in difficult times pessimism is a self-fulfilling self-inflicted death sentence 
community tools like text messaging that can tell you when pollen counts are up or smog levels are rising or a natural disaster is unfolding can give you the information you need to act in a timely fashion 
the political aspects of mobile phones can't be ignored either from text message swarms in korea helping to bring down a government to the blairwatch project in the uk keeping tabs on politicians who try to avoid the press 
now imagine a similar model for networking environmentalists 
imagine a web portal collecting recordings and evidence of what's happening to the planet putting news and data at the fingertips of people of all kinds from activists and researchers to businesspeople and political figures 
now just to be clear in this talk i'm using the name earth witness as part of the scenario simply as a shorthand for what this imaginary project could aspire to not to piggyback on the wonderful work of the witness organization 
earth witness would show us two worlds the world we're leaving behind and the world we're building for generations to come 
after this we noticed a couple of interesting things which you'll see 
make yourself understood to the computer 
and he couldn't travel so i went over there 
and all over india at the end of about two years children were beginning to google their homework 
they said yes we did 
so i said for two months you were looking at stuff you didn't understand 
it took me three years to publish that 
i said no use the method of the grandmother 
what is that can you do that again can you show me some more' she did that for two months 
the scores went up to 50 which is what the posh schools of new delhi with a trained biotechnology teacher were getting 
the first group -- the best one -- solved everything in 20 minutes 
the average score when i'd done it with the computers and the groups was 76 percent 
back at gateshead a 10-year-old girl gets into the heart of hinduism in 15 minutes 
you know stuff which i don't know anything about 
this is a sole in newcastle 
i started writing english questions on the blackboard 
so you know what's happened 
thanks 
i was too young unmarried i had no children didn't really know africa and besides my french was pitiful 
so then i went the whole american way with competitions team and individual completely failed but over time the women learnt to sell on their own way 
so blue blue everything became blue 
i think andrew pretty well covered that so i will move to the third point which is that markets alone also are not going to solve the problems of poverty 
both of them live at the confluence of public health and enterprise and both of them because they're manufacturers create jobs directly and create incomes indirectly because they're in the malaria sector and africa loses about 13 billion dollars a year because of malaria 
and it's really time we start thinking more creatively about how they can be fused 
he was actually living in the kibera slums when his father called him and told him about artemisia and the value-add potential 
samuel's kids are in private school and he's starting to help other farmers in the area also go into artemisia production -- dignity being more important than wealth 
the next one many of you know 
and so from an enterprise perspective for africa and from a public health perspective these are real successes 
we can start building local distribution and actually it can cost the public sector much less 
one that people will pay different prices but the overwhelming number of people will come forth at one dollar per net and make a decision to buy it 
but what it takes is a commitment from all of us to essentially refuse trite assumptions get out of our ideological boxes 
and we came up with some parameters because you know building a rube goldberg machine has limitations but it also is pretty wide open 
okay so now the start to finish timing has to be perfect 
of those 85 takes only three actually successfully completed their run 
and the wonderful elation that we had when we finally completed it 
it think we can do better than this hello tedxusc 
let me start again 
where it goes in the future is questioned so that's the human part 
and in that 15 percent the main focus is on human mind thinking skills somehow trying to unleash kids from the straightjacket of school which is putting information and dogma into them get them so they really think ask tough questions argue about serious subjects don't believe everything that's in the book think broadly or creative they can be 
here's a giant flying replica of a pterosaur that has no tail 
this was the full size of the original creature 
it sends high-resolution video pictures back to the operator 
buckminster fuller said it clearly there are no passengers on spaceship earth only crew we the crew can and must do more with less -- much less 
it's amazing just on the puny power of the sun -- by having a super lightweight plane you're able to get it up there 
we couldn't bring one here to fly it and show you 
but there's a lot of technology going 
sorry 
it never makes a mistake because if you make a mistake you don't leave any progeny 
in concluding i want to get back to the big picture and i have just two final slides to try and put it in perspective 
and so i just put robotic and natural cockroaches out there but you can fill in whatever you want this is not a forecast 
last night we gave it a few too many turns and it tried to bash the roof out also it's about a gram 
thank you  
and despite their ferocious appearance tasmanian devils are actually quite adorable little animals 
but inevitably these tumors progress towards being enormous ulcerating tumors like this one here 
they were too young to survive without their mother 
scientists around the world were intrigued by this cancer this infectious cancer that was spreading through the tasmanian devil population 
i myself had a tumor removed from my large intestine when i was only 14 
paradoxically once established natural selection actually favors the continued growth of cancer 
so cancer could be thought of as a strange short-lived self-destructive life form -- an evolutionary dead end 
in fact more genetic profiling told us that this tumor in jonas actually probably first arose from the cells of a female tasmanian devil -- and jonas was clearly a male 
so how come a tumor that arose from the cells of another individual is growing on jonas' face 
well the next breakthrough came from studying hundreds of tasmanian devil cancers from all around tasmania 
they tend to bite each other often quite ferociously and usually on the face 
but if this can happen in tasmanian devils why hasn't it happened in other animals or even humans 
well the answer is it has 
she took him to the vet and the vet discovered something quite disgusting 
so we've seen that this can happen in animals 
ad he decided to put this to the test by actually deliberately inoculating people with cancer from somebody else 
most of the people that dr southam injected did not go on to develop cancer from the injected cells 
and i think that this is something that oncologists and epidemiologists should be aware of in the future 
why has the record been so poor 
because after years of stagnation and decline the mentality of politics is that it's a zero-sum game 
the security council typically has the responsibility for providing the peacekeepers who build the security 
it does increase security 
one is jobs 
now that is difficult 
so we need to encourage the growth of local firms 
and it's schizophrenic because in their hearts donors know that's not a realistic agenda and so what they also do is the total bypass just fund ngos 
it's to split the functions of a monopoly line ministry up into three 
so they wouldn't be provided thanks to the united states government and some ngo 
and basically what i'd like to tell you is that power is changing and there are two types of changes i want to discuss 
what we're going to see in the 21st century is asia gradually returning to being more than half of the world's population and more than half of the world's product 
it's not just prevailing at war though war still persists 
if we try to focus on the reality then what we need to focus on is what's really happening in terms of china and the united states 
and that the chinese won't catch up or pass the americans until somewhere in the latter part after 2050 of this century 
why does it matter who cares 
the answer is it matters quite a lot 
so empowering china to deal with its own problems of carbon is good for everybody and it's not a zero sum i win you lose 
how do we define our national interests so that it's not just zero sum but positive sum 
the world has a new mania 
a mania for learning english 
t i don't want to let myself down 
t perfect s perfect 
s i want to change my life 
so is english mania good or bad 
and now english is becoming the language of problem-solving 
it's a true feeling 
why is this old table in your office 
and as i grew up i heard so much knowledge and so many insights and so much wisdom come out around this table i began to call it the wisdom table 
and i was so shocked so stunned i got up and said well thank you but what do i do 
and that question cleared the space 
this film is called world peace and other 4th grade achievements 
and it's a beautiful thing 
and i saw miss ethel j banks who wore pearls and high-heels to elementary school every day 
and i'm not even talking about you behind me because i've got eyes in the back of my head 
and really i feel as though when i see the film -- i have a gesture she does like this -- i feel like i am a continuation of her gesture 
and so this world peace game i'd like to tell you about 
i didn't want to lecture or have just book reading 
i offer them the job they can turn it down and then they choose their own cabinet 
that's not all 
i throw them into this complex matrix and they trust me because we have a deep rich relationship together 
there's oil spills environmental disasters water rights disputes breakaway republics famine endangered species and global warming 
i have no chance to make any policy whatsoever once they start playing 
and because i don't know they've got to dig up the answer 
my question to you is who's in charge of that classroom 
and we were very upset 
i could not have designed that in teaching it 
it'll be more realer if she reads it 
we have a lot of data but i think sometimes we go beyond data with the real truth of what's going on 
and there are three seconds left on the clock 
i joined telco made tata trucks pretty close to pune 
so i took one year off and i went to this village science program 
this square might look very square and prim 
but give a child a triangle he can't do a thing to it 
they always make a triangular roof 
now this is people science 
the insects are eaten by the frogs the frogs are eaten by the snakes the snakes are eaten by the eagles 
and you put a little fan here 
and this is a hundred-year-old toy 
i just put this inside this 
the most expensive thing is the battery inside this 
this is an old bicycle tube which gives you a broad rubber band two safety pins 
it's the interaction of both these magnets which makes this motor spin 
there are six layers -- three layers of plastic aluminum -- which are are sealed together 
i'm going to keep this outside to blow out i'm going to suck in air 
well before i go any further this is something worth sharing 
if i crank the handle all the wool goes inside 
there are 12 million blind children in our country --  who live in a world of darkness 
when first you see nehru and gandhi this is the nehru cap -- just half a newspaper 
and the second night he would take the same cap and give it another fold 
and there's a third one over here 
firstly radical increases in resource efficiency 
and for all three of these i believe biomimicry has a lot of the solutions that we're going to need 
and i'm just going to talk through this animation 
and just as natural systems tend to increase in diversity and resilience over time there's a real sense with this project that the number of possibilities just continue increasing 
and the kind of elements i'm talking about are firstly we have a restaurant inside a productive greenhouse a bit like this one in amsterdam called de kas 
so for instance when julius caesar arrived in north africa huge areas of north africa were covered in cedar and cypress forests 
the converse is also true 
the more vegetation we lose the more that's likely to exacerbate climate change and lead to further desertification 
the way it does this is it comes out at night crawls to the top of a sand dune and because it's got a matte black shell is able to radiate heat out to the night sky and become slightly cooler than its surroundings 
and the ingenuity if you could call it that goes even further 
between them there's a waxy finish which repels water 
we're working with the guy who invented the seawater greenhouse 
this is a greenhouse designed for arid coastal regions and the way it works is that you have this whole wall of evaporator grills and you trickle seawater over that so that wind blows through it picks up a lot of moisture and is cooled in the process 
and what they found with the first seawater greenhouse that was built was it was producing slightly more freshwater than it needed for the plants inside 
and when you think about nature often you think about it as being all about competition 
you think what can i add to the system to create more value 
and it turns out that different things crystallize out at different stages 
now we would be able to make use of all that waste brine 
we could evaporate it to enhance the restorative benefits and capture the salts transforming an urgent waste problem into a big opportunity 
far too much of the talk about the environment uses very negative language 
and this is an important point 
there are very few doctors and quite frankly these countries do not have the resources that are needed to cope with such epidemics 
very simple 
and knowing that starts to explain a lot of long-standing mysteries in science 
it also brings up new issues though like computational irreducibility 
you know in working on this science for many years i kept wondering what will be its first killer app 
let's start off with something really easy 
and it should be able to tell us that 
let's say the revenue of microsoft 
well even starting from mathematica this is still a huge amount of work 
well a crucial idea of wolfram alpha is that you can just ask it questions using ordinary human language which means that we've got to be able to take all those strange utterances that people type into the input field and understand them 
and i must say that i thought that step might just be plain impossible 
right now if we look at web queries more than 80 percent of them get handled successfully the first time 
and when one does that one really changes the economics of delivering computational things whether it's on the web or elsewhere 
i'll show you one example here 
something like rule 30 for example turns out to be a really good randomness generator 
so could that be what's going on with our whole universe 
but in at least a large class of cases one can think of the universe as being like some kind of network which when it gets big enough behaves like continuous space in much the same way as having lots of molecules can behave like a continuous fluid 
actually i haven't shown these before but here are a few of the candidate universes that i've looked at 
benoit mandelbrot is in the audience 
we've questioned the future of capitalism 
and the idea is a simple simple idea which is the fact that the consumer has moved from a state of anxiety to action 
the consumer is empowered 
do you know what this was right here 
and what you end up seeing is the whole phenomenon of the fact that we are actually stepping forth and basically leveraging future education future children in our households 
however consumers have moved 
dentists report molars you know people grinding their teeth coming in and reporting the fact that they've had stress 
but seriously what we see happening and the reason i want to stress that the consumer is not in retreat is that this is a tremendous opportunity for the consumer who drove us into this recession to lead us right back out 
we see high-end haggling in fashion today 
so from a value and values standpoint what companies can do is connect in lots of different ways 
gore-tex is all about personal accountability of their management and their employees to the point where they really kind of shun the idea of bosses 
the third of the four laws of post-crisis consumerism is about durable living 
i was fascinated to learn that 30 percent of all homes in america are actually built by owners 
let's look at a couple of quick examples 
you need to harness it you need to give it meaning 
this kogi doesn't exist it's a moving truck right 
or you look at johnson &amp johnson's momversations 
you see this rising force in sort of total transparency and openness that companies are starting to adopt all because the consumer is demanding it 
but at the same time this is also a tremendous opportunity 
so i decided to investigate 
so i'm going to challenge all of you 
we talk about world peace 
and i want to thank all of you in the audience for being great husbands great mothers friends daughters sons 
that's what i do in life -- telling stories writing novels -- and today i would like to tell you a few stories about the art of storytelling and also some supernatural creatures called the djinni 
i was born in strasbourg france to turkish parents 
in response she said yes praying is effective but also beware of the power of circles 
we all do 
our friends neighbors colleagues family -- if all the people in our inner circle resemble us it means we are surrounded with our mirror image 
instead it generated an atmosphere in which each child was seen -- not as an individual on his own but as the representative of something larger 
i came to learn that these were the three main stereotypes about my country politics cigarettes and the veil 
i lived in a very vibrant diverse neighborhood where i wrote several of my novels 
what i experienced as a child in that school in madrid is happening in the literary world today 
meanwhile the other leg draws a wide circle constantly moving 
we see them as the domain of supernatural creatures like the djinn who are made of smokeless fire and are the symbol of elusiveness 
perhaps that's not the right way to start at all 
you see there it's about 620 billion a year 
r&ampd in total in the economy publicly funded is about 06 percent of gdp 
the first thing i want to say and this is straight from wonders of the solar system is that our exploration of the solar system and the universe has shown us that it is indescribably beautiful 
so tiny moon 
that's fascinating and beautiful in itself but we think that the mechanism for powering those fountains requires there to be lakes of liquid water beneath the surface of this moon 
and what's important about that is that on our planet on earth wherever we find liquid water we find life 
tremendous and beautiful discovery 
and they saw strange pictures like this 
it's called helios -- helios from the sun 
that's a type ia supernova explosion 
it sits there about say 13 times the mass of the sun 
i think that's a remarkable demonstration of the power and beauty and universality of the laws of physics because we understand that process because we understand the structure of atoms here on earth 
and if i blow it up there you see it 
but it visited jupiter saturn uranus and neptune 
you could have made it in the 1890s you wouldn't have the transistor 
let me leave the last words to someone who's rapidly becoming a hero of mine humphrey davy who did his science at the turn of the 19th century 
thank you 
streets have names blocks are just the unnamed spaces in between streets 
they say oh well that's block 17 and this is block 16 
just look at google maps here there's block 14 15 16 17 18 19 
you say ok but walking around the neighborhood i noticed that the house numbers don't go in order 
it's a phenomenon on the internet today called behavioral tracking and it is very big business 
our daughter then joined us at the breakfast table and i asked her is there an emphasis on music literacy in your school 
i go to work i check email i log onto a few more social sites i blog i check more news reports i share some of those news reports i go look at some videos pretty typical day -- in this case actually fairly pedantic -- and at the end of the day as my day winds down look at my profile 
and i’d say well i’m walking for the environment 
i called my parents up 
and so i did 
it’s only 500 miles 
i had written the university of montana two years earlier and said i'd like to go to school there 
but i use that story because they really wanted to help me 
i had 13 students when i first walked into the class 
i could see they were looking for the schedule to see when they could get out 
they had to take that class with me 
and on earth day 1990 -- the 20th anniversary of earth day -- that’s when i began to speak 
i got on a sailboat and i sailed down to the caribbean and walked through all of the islands and to venezuela 
and i got to -- i start saying free at last -- thank god almighty i’m free at last 
i had no idea i was going to become a un ambassador 
i was going to have to change 
i know i needed to change because it would be the only way that i could be here today 
when does learning begin 
well today i want to present to you an idea that may be surprising and may even seem implausible but which is supported by the latest evidence from psychology and biology 
now i'm a science reporter 
i write books and magazine articles 
the flavors of the food a pregnant woman eats find their way into the amniotic fluid which is continuously swallowed by the fetus 
what this means is that fetuses are effectively being taught by their mothers about what is safe and good to eat 
the pregnant woman's diet and stress level in particular provide important clues to prevailing conditions like a finger lifted to the wind 
the hunger winter as it came to be known killed some 10000 people and weakened thousands more 
learning is one of life's most essential activities and it begins much earlier than we ever imagined 
you'd still have five billion left in change and people would ask for the trains to be slowed down 
now years after you remember the strategic question of whether you're flying in a 777 or an airbus you remember those words and that experience 
i mean it could almost be rather like that scene from the film airplane 
i spoke about this before and a brilliant person got in touch with me and said okay what can you do 
one of them also being although logically it's quite a good idea to have a lift with no up and down button in it if it only serves two floors it's actually bloody terrifying okay 
they said can we do an advertising campaign 
i said it's really really easy 
now interesting that no single person does that or at least can admit to being so anal as to do it 
moving over we come of course to consultancy 
i mean tiger surely was actually obeying the accenture model 
that's why i call for the chief detail officer 
but as i was moving away from the traditional classical repertoire and trying to find new ways of musical expression i realized that with today's technological resources there's no reason to limit what can be produced at one time from a single string instrument 
but what actually interests me a lot more is the fact that in the tip of each controller is a relatively high-performing infrared camera 
and i also was taught coupled with that that it was my job -- this classroom full of five and six year-old children -- it was our job apparently to help 
this is what jesus asked of us 
that was news to me and it felt like it was a very important thing to get to participate in 
and i felt overwhelmed 
and i didn't know what would happen when i ran out of things to give especially if the problem was never going away 
i heard about things that were going wrong in the lives of the poor 
i started to feel guilty for my own relative wealth because i wasn't doing more apparently to make things better 
it became a transaction for me became sort of a trade 
so i spent three months in kenya uganda and tanzania interviewing entrepreneurs that had received 100 dollars to start or grow a business 
i was starting to be friends and get to know their personal stories 
but there were these beautiful details even if i talked to 20 goat herders in a row and some days that's what happened -- these beautiful details of life change that were meaningful to them 
i never once was asked for a donation which had kind of been my mode right 
we sent it over to uganda 
when you lend them money and they slowly pay you back over time you have this excuse to have an ongoing dialogue 
so the mapping of participating in the story it actually flows with the up and down 
we make it really really simple for me as well as anyone else who wants to use the site 
but the good news is i don't think i need to stand here and convince you to care -- i'm not even going to try 
and i'm grateful that whenever i do that guaranteed i am inspired -- i am inspired by the person i am listening to 
what is the future of the human race 
if not what created the universe 
first there were the laws like maxwell's equations and general relativity that determined the evolution of the universe given its state over all of space at one time 
however this division into laws of evolution and initial conditions depends on time and space being separate and distinct 
indeed it has probably given me more time than most people to pursue the quest for knowledge 
professor hawking thank you for that answer 
i'm a geologist by training but i love that 
here we're going to see one backing into a crevice and watch his tentacles -- he just pulls them in makes them look just like algae 
that's an amazing thing 
and an octopus ain't that amazing now roger spooked him so he took off in a cloud of ink and when he lands the octopus says oh i've been seen 
and now he's gone and so am i thank you very much 
that's the lucy species and was found by my research team in december of 2000 in an area called dikika 
it's in the northeastern part of ethiopia 
you don't just jump into an invitation 
first entertainment comes evidence from flutes that are 35000 years old 
when you get there this is what you see and it's the vastness of the place which makes you feel helpless and vulnerable 
you find elephants rhinos monkeys pigs etc 
again another one that's a monkey that's a pig etc 
here is a close-up of the fossil after five years of cleaning preparation and description which was very long and i had to expose the bones from the sandstone block i just showed you in the previous slide 
so then once you've done that the next stage is to know what it is 
you don't see that in chimpanzees and you don't see this very projecting canine 
and how old was she when she died 
that's why we need care from our parents 
so by being at the cusp of our evolutionary history selam unites us all and gives us a unique account on what makes us human 
up to now the knowledge that we had about our ancestors came essentially from adult individuals because the fossils the baby fossils were missing 
imagine somebody coming from mars and his job is to report on the type of people occupying our planet earth and you hide all the babies the children and he goes back and reports 
and they were probably not aware of this future legacy but they did great 
with an average depth of the oceans of 4000 meters in fact the high seas covers and provides nearly 90 percent of the habitat for life on this earth 
it is in theory the global commons belonging to us all 
so here is a picture of the high seas as seen from above -- that area in the darker blue 
and of course if you want people to play by the rules you still need an effective system of monitoring and enforcement for as we've discovered you can trust but you also need to verify 
it's also known as the spawning ground for eels from northern european and northern american rivers that are now so dwindling in numbers that they've actually stopped showing up in stockholm and five showed up in the uk just recently 
it's actually a bay 
coming closer to here the costa rica dome is a recently discovered area -- potentially year-round habitat for blue whales 
that is it provides a wonderful example of where you can go with a real regional initiative 
so what we've been suggesting is that we either need to amend the world heritage convention so that it can adopt and urge universal protection of these world heritage sites or we need to change the name and call it half-the-world heritage convention 
what i find so exciting is that the census of marine life has looked at more than the tagging of pacific predators it's also looked in the really unexplored mid-water column where creatures like this flying sea cucumber have been found 
and the exciting thing is that we do have sufficient information to move ahead to protect some of these significant hope spots hotspots 
but not all the vessels have those to date 
we need to get the new paradigm of precaution and respect 
so here we are seven years 500 interviews later and i'm gonna tell you what really leads to success and makes ted-sters tick 
and the first thing i say to them is ok well you can't serve yourself you gotta serve others something of value 
while that might be a somewhat morbid thought i think it has some really profound implications that are worth exploring 
but today we're all creating this incredibly rich digital archive that's going to live in the cloud indefinitely years after we're gone 
and what this lets you do is create an online tribute to your loved ones complete with photos and videos and stories that they can post after you die 
but what i think comes next is far more interesting 
now we're already starting to see some experiments here 
taking it a step further mit's media lab is working on robots that can interact more like humans 
it's not that it's not possible to feed clothe and house us all and have us live decent lives 
and that's what will happen to us 
i accept where we are 
the future is inherently uncertain 
imagine our highly-tuned just-in-time food industry and our highly-stressed agricultural system failing and supermarket shelves emptying 
if we feel it now and think it through we will realize we have nothing to fear but fear itself 
we can do this 
i know the free market fundamentalists will tell you that more growth more stuff and nine billion people going shopping is the best we can do 
we have achieved remarkable things since working out how to grow food some 10000 years ago 
we've built a powerful foundation of science knowledge and technology -- more than enough to build a society where nine billion people can lead decent meaningful and satisfying lives 
we can choose this moment of crisis to ask and answer the big questions of society's evolution -- like what do we want to be when we grow up when we move past this bumbling adolescence where we think there are no limits and suffer delusions of immortality 
we can choose life over fear 
and one more thing archie was suffering from this illness himself 
so the situation seemed pretty desperate 
he gives half of them vitamin b12 
so cochrane then goes to the germans who are running the prison camp 
and he can't understand how this barbarism can be tolerated and he vents his frustrations 
so the symptoms of the complex are no matter how complicated the problem you have an absolutely overwhelming belief that you are infallibly right in your solution 
you could count them in five minutes 
what is evolution 
how do you do it 
it falls to the floor 
you make lots of money 
ten percent of americans don't disappear every year 
i sometimes wonder 
now i've been sort of banging on about this for the last couple of months and people sometimes say to me well tim it's kind of obvious 
and there's an authority figure in the corner behind the teacher's desk who knows all the answers 
when schools stop doing that all the time i will admit that yes it's obvious that trial and error is a good thing 
until then until then i'm going to keep banging on about trial and error and why we should abandon the god complex 
they had the god complex in spades 
and after the trial had been running for a little while he gathered together all his colleagues around his table and he said well gentlemen we have some preliminary results 
shut it down at once 
tumbleweed rolls through the meeting room 
it isn't easy 
so shortly after the war this young man yutaka taniyama developed this amazing conjecture called the taniyama-shimura conjecture 
in fact it turns out it's equivalent to proving fermat's last theorem 
you prove one you prove the other 
and the problem with leverage is it makes the us financial system look like this 
that means every bad loan goes bad 47 times over 
and as you think about that you've got to wonder so what do banks have in store for you now 
except we've been so busy giving away a trillion here a trillion there that we've brought that date of reckoning forward to about 2017 
we're going to start to pay them 
this guy runs the china investment corporation 
this is an actual bill 
if you look at the federal budget this is what it looks like 
everything else is mandated 
that's the short term that's the flame part 
among other things because startup companies are 02 percent of us gdp investmentm and they're about 178 percent of output 
twenty-one countries came together dozens of teams 
two years ago you saw this creature 
but then if you lose one of those second set of teeth they don't regrow unless if you're a lawyer 
so there are now nine women walking around boston with re-grown bladders which is much more pleasant than walking around with a whole bunch of plastic bags for the rest of your life 
if you don't have a flat world that's not good which is why the robot's we're designing today are a little different 
and this stuff is moving very quickly and by the way that thing can carry about 350 pounds of weight 
and about two or three years after they can hear as well as you and i can they'll be able to hear maybe how bats sing or how whales talk or how dogs talk and other types of tonal scales 
this is a group in germany that's beginning to engineer eyes so that people who are blind can begin to see light and dark 
very primitive 
they'll do stuff you and i can't do 
and it's the 150th anniversary of the publication of the origin of species 
maybe not 
once upon a time there was a dread disease that afflicted children 
and so as a consequence a few years later another scientist -- perhaps maybe this scientist not quite as brilliant as the one who had preceded him but building on the invention of the first one -- came up with a second cure 
and the beauty of the second cure for this disease was that it could be used on infants and one-year-olds 
and the government they heard her story and the other people and they said yeah you're right we should make a law 
we would lose all of our market 
so many times when you try to do research on data it records complicated stories -- it's hard to find in the data 
and then finally the last set of bars which are really controlling for everything you could possibly imagine about the crash 50 75 100 different characteristics of the crash 
and the other thing you might argue is well car seats have got a lot better over time 
so they just have these bench seats and they strap the car seat and the seatbelt onto it 
anyway it turns out that those two crashes that actually the three-year-old did slightly worse so he gets about a 500 out of -- you know on this range -- relative to a 400 and something 
and this seatbelt would have passed with flying colors into being approved as a car seat 
it's in 5000 days all this stuff has come 
there's two million emails per second 
it's just a huge machine and it uses five percent of the global electricity on the planet 
and in some ways it's sort of back to the kind of old idea of centralized computing 
and i am suggesting that every bit will be owned by the web 
they're going to talk to the machine 
now with rfids and other things -- whatever technology it is it doesn't really matter the point is that everything will have embedded in it some sensor connecting it to the machine and so we have basically an internet of things 
but in fact what the new economy really is is the marriage of those two where we embed the information and the digital nature of things into the material world 
attention is the currency 
and i'm saying humans are now going to be the extended senses of the machine in a certain sense 
now the second thing that i want to talk about was this idea of restructuring that what the web is doing is restructuring 
and what you had to do was -- if you wanted to participate in this you had to share packets of information 
it wasn't like a telephone system where you had control of a line you had to share packets 
the second stage that we're in now is the idea of linking pages 
you couldn't deny -- if someone wanted to link to you you couldn't stop them you had to participate in this idea of opening up your pages to be linked by anybody 
so the last thing i want to talk about is this idea that we're going to be codependent 
and what is happening with this is some kind of ai but it's not the ai in conscious ai as being an expert larry page told me that that's what they're trying to do and that's what they're trying to do 
but it'll anticipate what we're doing in a good sense 
and all these devices will be portals into that 
it was on jonestown 
the top picture is a group of moonies that have been blessed by their messiah 
and so what is this how does this work 
these easy ideas to complex questions are very appealing when you are emotionally vulnerable 
we're beginning to look inside the brain 
and so if you looked at my brain or any brain that's infected with a viral memetic infection like this and compared it to anyone in this room or anyone who uses critical thinking on a regular basis i am convinced it would look very very different 
because i have to say for my whole career if there's anything that's been consistent it's been that you can't do it 
it's calvino's idea of the quickest way between two points is the circuitous line not the straight line 
we make physical things buildings that become a part in an accretional process they make cities 
and i've had for 30 years an interest in a series of complexities where a series of forces are brought to bear and to understand the nature of the final result of that representing the building itself 
this is a project that we just finished in penang for a very very large city project that came directly out of this process which is the result of the multiplicity of forces that produce it 
and an image which may be closest talks about the use of light as a medium that light becomes literally a building material 
this will be the first building in the united states that took -- well i can't say it took the air conditioning out it's a hybrid 
and i understood that building really could be the augmentation of the earth's surface and it completely shifted the notion of building ground in the most basic sense 
what i'm interested in are how these ideas participate in the educational process of young people 
one enters the building as it lifts off the ground and it becomes part of the idea 
and then the skin -- the edges of this -- all promote the dynamic the movement of the building as a series of seismic shifts geologic shifts right 
and finally one of the most interesting projects -- it's a courthouse 
here's a piano nobile which is a device used in the renaissance 
it changed the way our history developed 
it is made for a diet which is soft mushy which is reduced in fibers which is very easily chewable and digestible 
sounds like fast food doesn't it 
it's technology 
so this ingenuity of our ancestors to invent this most marvelous technology 
we populated all the ecologies 
it keeps also your brain working 
okay it's not obvious to be honest 
now having a large brain as you know is a big advantage because you can actually influence your environment 
you know we have up to five tastes three of them sustain us 
so we can make mixtures of all this kind of thing because we know that in cooking we can transform it to the form 
so satisfaction was a very important part 
if you get a stomach ache if you get a little bit bloated was not the right food was not the right cooking manipulation or maybe other things went wrong 
but what it means to have a brain there is that not only the big brain has to talk with the food the food has to talk with the brain because we have to learn actually how to talk to the brains 
this is the layer which actually touches the food you are swallowing and you digest which is actually the lumen 
what it means is that we have a layered control system 
so if you override the hunger signal you can have a disorder which is called anorexia 
this is fat digestion 
actually what happens is that a very intricate structure appears 
you know culture was born of the imagination and the imagination -- the imagination as we know it -- came into being when our species descended from our progenitor homo erectus and infused with consciousness began a journey that would carry it to every corner of the habitable world 
and the way clayton put it was this way 
i recently sailed on the hokulea named after the sacred star of hawaii throughout the south pacific to make a film about the navigators 
i spent 30 years living amongst the people of chinchero and i always heard about an event that i always wanted to participate in 
and then you do the ritual dances that empower the crosses 
these of course are the descendants of the ancient tairona civilization 
there are four societies the kogi the wiwa the kankwano and the arhuacos 
i traveled with the arhuacos and the wonderful thing about this story was that this man danilo villafane -- if we just jump back here for a second 
we traveled high into the paramo and as we crested the hills we realized that the men were interpreting every single bump on the landscape in terms of their own intense religiosity 
and we ran into a farc patrol at dawn so it was quite harrowing 
they dismiss the rest of us who have ruined the world as the younger brothers they cannot understand why it is that we do what we do to the earth 
and when asked that question they respond with 6000 different voices 
they are unique answers to that fundamental question what does it mean to be human and alive 
so you're living through a time when virtually half of humanity's intellectual social and spiritual legacy is being allowed to slip away 
this does not have to happen 
so i'd like to spend a few minutes with you folks today imagining what our planet might look like in a thousand years 
this is crazy 
if you're in northern europe or north america you can use things like buckwheat husks or oat hulls 
because the manufacturing process is our organism 
they're not going to clog up earth's ecosystems they work great 
my brief as you've just heard is to tell you about statistics -- and to be more precise to tell you some exciting things about statistics 
don't tell her i said that 
she paused and said he models things 
the next time after the 15th toss 
that's what i want this side to think about 
either they're the same or this one's bigger than this one or this one's bigger than that one 
who thinks that c is true -- that on average it'll take less time to see head-tail-head than head-tail-tail 
the champagne's on ice just next to you you've got the glasses chilled to celebrate 
and if it comes down a head that's great 
it's the same for the first two parts of the sequence 
if it's a head you're disappointed but you're still a third of the way to your pattern again 
this is my little diversion into my real passion which is genetics 
when you toss a coin you get a sequence of heads and tails 
and they're an enormously useful tool in modern molecular biology 
but it turns out that unlocking the secrets in the information generated by modern experimental technologies a key part of that has to do with fairly sophisticated -- you'll be relieved to know that i do something useful in my day job rather more sophisticated than the head-tail-head story -- but quite sophisticated computer modelings and mathematical modelings and modern statistical techniques 
it's not the answer and it's not because it's only part of the story 
here's a little caricature of a million individuals 
those of you in britain will know about what's become rather a celebrated case of a woman called sally clark who had two babies who died suddenly 
and to argue then that the chance of a second death is as if you didn't know that information is really silly 
one of them is that sally clark was innocent -- which is a priori overwhelmingly likely -- most mothers don't kill their children 
so just to conclude -- what are the take-home messages from this 
we are not good at reasoning with uncertainty 
all of quality control which has had a major impact on industrial processing is underpinned by statistics 
this is a world-changing invention 
well it turns out that the main causes are faulty and misused appliances and electrical wiring 
hmmm  
so far we've applied for 414 patent claims 
so to conclude intelligent power can globally save thousands of lives prevent tens of thousands of injuries and eliminate tens of billions of dollars in property damage every single year while significantly reducing global energy consumption 
in the spirit of this year's ted conference we think this is a powerful world-changing invention 
and that's what i'd like to talk to you a little bit about today 
it's acoustic vibrations in the air little waves of energy in the air that tickle our eardrum 
and it's at the hair cell level that they do this 
in fact nothing even actually comes close to our ability to restore hearing 
and as a physician and a surgeon i can confidently tell my patients that if you had to pick a sense to lose we are the furthest along medically and surgically with hearing 
okay play that video please 
i'm saying that they're going to face obstacles that most people who have normal hearing will not have to face 
now hearing loss and the treatment for hearing loss has really evolved in the past 200 years 
i mean literally they used to do things like stick ear-shaped objects onto your ears and stick funnels in 
language is very different language is very precise 
in fact the whole reason we use it is because it has semantic-specificity 
but it certainly wasn't the way the music was intended 
what that suggests is that even in the case of hearing loss the capacity for music remains 
and here's a video of joseph 
joseph i was born in 1986 
when i was 12 years old i was one of the first few people in singapore who underwent cochlear implantation 
and this is really unheard of stuff and this is all because of this technology 
you don't actually have to hear it 
i know he doesn't hear well because i've heard him do karaoke 
and so this idea has a lot of traction with us 
and so i'm here to tell you you don't need a computer to actually have a spell in fact what you can do at the molecular level is that if you encode information -- you encode a spell or program as molecules -- then physics can actually directly interpret that information and run a program that's what happens in proteins 
when this amino acid sequence gets pronounced as atoms these little letters are sticky for each other 
so here's a shape i actually spent about a year in my home in my underwear coding like linus [torvalds] in that picture before 
i mix them together add a little bit of salt water and then add this long strand i was telling you about that i've stolen from a virus and then what happens is you heat this whole thing up to about boiling you cool it down to room temperature and as you do what happens is those short strands they do the following thing each one of them binds that long strand in one place and then has a second half that binds that long strand in a distant place and brings those two parts of the long strand close together so that they stick together 
you can make a molecule that looks like this and you know he likes to hang out with his buddies right 
so that's dna origami that's one way there are many ways of casting molecular spells using dna 
i did not choose to take up the pen the brush the camera 
why did i choose the gun as my instrument 
my father was a hardworking baker but when he had finished work in the bakery he often told me and my brother stories 
my father was there to provide it 
he fired nothing happened 
the murder rate in europe has dropped by a factor of 30 since the middle ages 
why has violence decreased 
or is there something else 
the armed forces implement the state monopoly on violence 
my soldiers use the gun as an instrument of peace 
and that is why -- and in the netherlands we are very unique in that -- that is why the dutch constitution states that one of the main tasks of the armed forces is to uphold and promote the international rule of law 
and i hope that one day armies can be disbanded and humans will find a way of living together without violence and oppression 
i hope you will support our soldiers when they are out there when they come home and when they are injured and need our care 
you're climbing on little dimples and nubbins in the rock 
women are much more in balance because they don't have that idea that they're going to be able to do 100 pull-ups 
they think about how to get the weight over their feet because it's sort of natural -- they carry you all day long 
it took us 15 years to sequence hiv -- we sequenced sars in 31 days 
if you put different communication technologies on this logarithmic graph television radio telephone were adopted in decades 
now by the way if you look at this on a linear graph it looks like everything has just happened but some observer says well kurzweil just put points on this graph that fall on that straight line 
and again it forms the same straight line you have a little bit of thickening in the line because people do have disagreements what the key points are there's differences of opinion when agriculture started or how long the cambrian explosion took 
it took us three years to double our price performance of computing in 1900 two years in the middle we're now doubling it every one year 
supercomputers -- same thing 
you would think it would be a very erratic process and you have a very smooth outcome of this chaotic process 
as we make them smaller and less expensive the electrons have less distance to travel 
and economists have actually started worrying about that 
this is due to greater productivity but the economist says but there's no way you're going to be able to keep up with that 
these were evolved in very different times -- we'd like to actually change those programs 
we'd like to actually turn that program off 
four or five pharmaceutical companies have noticed this felt that would be interesting drug for the human market and that's just one of the 30000 genes that affect our biochemistry 
for example we can inhibit genes now with rna interference 
it's now under a 10th of a cent 
once we understand its principles of operation and the pace with which we are reverse-engineering biology is accelerating we can actually design these things to be thousands of times more capable 
where will we get the software 
wall street noticed that this was a revolutionary technology which it was but then six months later when it hadn't revolutionized all business models they figured well that was wrong and then we had this bust 
images will be written directly to our retina providing full-immersion virtual reality augmented real reality we'll be interacting with virtual personalities 
you can go there with other people have any kind of experience with anyone involving all of the senses 
but most importantly it'll be a tremendous expansion of human intelligence through this direct merger with our technology which in some sense we're doing already 
it's just like this one completely worthless in which it allegedly worked by electrostatic magnetic ion attraction which translates to pseudoscientific baloney -- would be the nice word -- in which you string together a bunch of words that sound good but it does absolutely nothing 
in this case at trespass points allowing people to go through because your little tracker device said they were okay actually cost lives 
and in fact i think my thesis here is that belief is the natural state of things 
and that's called superstition and that i'm afraid we will always have with us 
you are a hominid three million years ago walking on the plains of africa 
you've been taken out of the gene pool 
the fish is degraded 20 percent 50 percent and then the one i showed you 70 percent 
and if you give them drugs that are dopamine antagonists they go away 
every time somebody looks at you you think people are staring at you 
because the lights on here 
so what you see in this particular ambiguous figure is of course the dolphins right 
that's a dolphin tail there guys 
so you recognize obama immediately 
and this is also i think the basis of conspiracy theories 
explains a lot maybe 
well that's a whole other lecture 
we know that if you stimulate the temporal lobe you can produce a feeling of out-of-body experiences near-death experiences which you can do by just touching an electrode to the temporal lobe there 
and you get a sense of out-of-body experience 
it ties together all this into the power of expectation and the power of belief 
okay now i'm going to ask you to pucker up 
pucker up big and lean in just a little bit okay 
jennifer the man came and started undressing me 
woman they insisted that i was lying 
text uganda ratified the convention against torture in 1986 
torture is defined as any act by which severe pain of suffering whether physical or mental is intentionally inflicted by a person acting in an official capacity to obtain information or a confession to punish coerce or intimidate 
and as the story of mr morales just down the road excuse me mr gabriel would you mind if we delayed your execution a little bit 
witness 
there could be a new movement growing up rising from the ground reaching for the light and growing strong just like a tree thank you 
so in that 18 minutes or 10 minutes or five minutes you have to convey a whole bunch of different characteristics 
next up is knowledge 
you walk in the door so the first thing you've got to do -- the overall you know arc of your presentation -- it's got to start like a rocket 
and everything has got to be reinforcing this 
okay so how do you do that 
well first of all logical progression 
you've also got to let me know that there are touchstones 
you want to tie in to the rest of the world out there 
so this all feeds in together 
you want absolute -- this is the zen of presentation right 
so with that said we only have a very very short time 
you do that you give me your quick 15-second or 30-second intro grab my attention 
we build widgets for the x y z market 
if it's a website show me a screenshot of your website 
five is a bit much probably four is rational 
and i look at the logo -- okay good 
powerpoint has this built into every copy of powerpoint that's shipped 
and the number one presentation tip never ever look at the screen 
and that is how to pitch to a vc 
i'm here today to start a revolution 
now before you get up in arms or you break into song or you pick a favorite color i want to define what i mean by revolution 
we're last place in health care and that's important for a sense of well-being 
that's social let's look at education 
because it's shown the way we apply generate and use knowledge is affected by our social and institutional context which told us what in communism 
it's a serious gene 
true story i went looking for a school for my kid 
it can't be because of play 
throughout the animal kingdom for example ants ants play 
kittens play we all know kittens play 
and it's not just kids it's adults too 
these guys are facts 
the opposite of play is not work 
just like there's benefits for humans and animals there's benefits for play at work 
you know the professional athlete that loves skiing he's serious about it but he loves it 
a doctor might be serious but laughter's still a great medicine 
you guys have to and if you're not feeling it your colleagues your employees aren't going to feel it 
fear is the enemy of play 
let them take long lunches 
what we need is a players' uprising 
what we need is a players' uprising 
what we need is a players' uprising 
and i am illustrating still 
which of course i am not agreeing with because although i am 94 i am not still working 
i still have -- or did i use the word still i didn't mean that 
these were just some of the things i've made 
these are tiles the word playful is a necessary aspect of our work because actually one of our problems is that we have to make produce lovely things throughout all of life and this for me is now 75 years 
so how can you without drying up make things with the same pleasure as a gift to others for so long 
i started as an apprentice to a hungarian craftsman and this taught me what the guild system was in middle ages 
we mashed the clay with our feet when it came from the hillside 
and finally i had received a document that i had accomplished my apprenticeship successfully that i had behaved morally and this document was given to me by the guild of roof-coverers rail-diggers oven-setters chimney sweeps and potters 
i also got at the time a workbook which explained my rights and my working conditions and i still have that workbook 
my mother thought that this was not very proper so she sat with us to add propriety to this activity 
however the director the chemist model maker -- everybody -- concerned himself much more with the art department -- that means with my work -- than making toilets so finally they got a letter from the center from the bank who owned the factory saying make toilet-setting behind the art department and that was my end 
so i will try speed it up a little  moderator eva we have about five minutes 
the accusation was that i had successfully prepared an attentat on stalin's life 
but since i survived and i'm here and since this is the end of the five minutes i will -- moderator tell me when your last trip to russia was 
oh this summer in fact the lomonosov factory was bought by an american company invited me 
that's my camera lens the first one -- the one i shot my bob dylan film with 35 years ago 
i called my sister i called my neighbors i said come dig 
that's my sister she took care of pictures because i was a big collector of snapshot photography that i believed said a lot 
she's still there she's there this morning actually 
and we went into parenting expecting our lives to look like this 
the nurse was coming at me with this beautiful beautiful child and i remember as she was approaching me the voices of friends saying the moment they put the baby in your hands you will feel a sense of love that will come over you that is [on] an order of magnitude more powerful than anything you've ever experienced in your entire life 
and it was also of course surreal 
you're either in love or you're not in love 
i enjoyed being pregnant i loved it 
of those 67 percent are most lonely when their kids are zero to five -- probably really zero to two 
in the process of preparing this we looked at how some other cultures around the world deal with this period of time because here in the western world less than 50 percent of us live near our family members which i think is part of why this is such a tough period 
the party line is that every single aspect of my life has just gotten dramatically better ever since i participated in the miracle that is childbirth and family 
as you get older you become more stable 
you start to realize that hey i could go to this live music event and have an utterly transforming experience that will cover my entire body with goosebumps but it's more likely that i'll feel claustrophobic and i won't be able to get a beer 
so your average happiness goes up but you lose those transcendent moments 
but you realize you resubmit yourself to losing control in a really wonderful way which we think provides a lot of meaning to our lives and is quite gratifying 
we trade the sort of security and safety of a certain level of contentment for these transcendent moments 
so where does that leave the two of us as a family with our three little boys in the thick of all this 
there's another factor in our case 
and we had reservations about this on the front end 
get out of the airplane it turns out you're trekking in nepal 
rg + av thank you 
we crave to be in the room with the musician the day it was recorded the day it was played 
and we go to live concerts and we get that as much as we can 
and yamaha makes an incredible thing called the disklavier pro that looks like a nice grand piano there 
he just got tired of being in front of an audience and felt like -- a performing monkey was in fact his term 
his maybe most famous recording was something called the goldberg variations 
he wrote some early pieces but late in his life in his mature period he said here's a theme -- 30 variations 
and gould recorded it in two major recordings that you may know about one in mono and one in stereo 
what i'd like you to hear live is the 1955 version and we'll play the first couple pieces of it 
so in the video world we've been able to invent in our lifetimes natural behavior 
and when you put on headphones and you listen to this you're inside of glenn gould's body 
your eyes are pretty happy with some color and movement you know 
you want to hear it in different rooms and whatever 
we made a new recording of him playing in the shrine auditorium in september 
and fortunately it's right in here 
i want to start just by saying a bit about where i'm coming from 
i trained briefly as a buddhist monk under this guy 
and although that was great for the music business at the time it wasn't much good for anything else 
unprecedented wealth and prosperity but that growth hasn't always delivered what we needed 
rates of depression carried on up right across the western world 
they bring ideas from the margins into the mainstream 
ronald reagan again said the two funniest sentences in the english language are i'm from the government and i'm here to help 
and i think more and more people are also asking why boost consumption rather than change what we consume 
it's not that our scientists are necessarily much smarter than they were a hundred years ago maybe they are but they have a hell of a lot more backing than they ever did 
and he believed we live with others we share the world with others and therefore our innovation must be done with others too not doing things at people for them and so on 
others are much more pragmatic health coaches learning mentors job clubs 
now the idea that all of this represents i think is rapidly becoming a common sense and part of how we respond to the crisis recognizing the need to invest in innovation for social progress as well as technological progress 
there were big health innovation funds launched earlier this year in this country as well as a public service innovation lab 
and if a generation or two ago the big challenges were ones like getting a man on the moon perhaps the challenges we need to set ourselves now are ones like eliminating child malnutrition stopping trafficking or one i think closer to home for america or europe why don't we set ourselves the goal of achieving a billion extra years of life for today's citizens 
now those are all goals which could be achieved within a decade but only with radical and systematic experiment not just with technologies but also with lifestyles and culture and policies and institutions too 
history was over and society would inevitably have to take second place to economy 
just as today the enthusiasts of unrestrained capitalism say it's rooted in human nature only now it's individualism inquisitiveness and so on 
you think i've lost my way and somebody's going to come on the stage in a minute and guide me gently back to my seat 
i want to tell you about my friend who was teaching english to adults in abu dhabi 
and one fine day she decided to take them into the garden to teach them some nature vocabulary 
a language dies every 14 days 
that is a little bit too early 
we were brought to teach english because the government wanted to modernize the country and to empower the citizens through education 
but if you're not a native speaker you have to pass a test 
do we really want to end up with 600 languages and the main one being english or chinese 
and i want to remind you that the giants upon whose shoulders today's intelligentsia stand did not have to have english they didn't have to pass an english test 
let me tell you a story about two scientists two english scientists 
so he invented a cost-free solar lamp 
when he received his award he said these lovely words the children can lead africa from what it is today a dark continent to a light continent 
i am known best for human-powered flight but that was just one thing that got me going in the sort of things that i'm working in now 
and we thought a solar-powered plane wouldn't really make sense but you could do it and it would get a lot of publicity for solar power and maybe help that field 
you don't need to dig down for these chemicals and we can do things much more efficiently 
so this just summarizes it over billions of years on a unique sphere chance has painted a thin covering of life -- complex and probable wonderful and fragile 
suddenly we humans a recently arrived species no longer subject to the checks and balances inherent in nature have grown in population technology and intelligence to a position of terrible power we now wield the paintbrush 
okay and let's have the next 
and then also like it said in the video you can turn it left or right just by putting the lift under one wing or another 
and that's it yeah just a few inventions 
most of the talks that you've heard in the last several fabulous days have been from people who have the characteristic that they have thought about something they are experts they know what's going on 
all of you know about the topic that i'm supposed to talk about 
well it enables you to drink coffee 
and the other of course is a birth control pill which in a very simple way fundamentally changed the structure of society by changing the role of women in it by providing to them the opportunity to make reproductive choices 
it's like what is simplicity 
what is the state of science 
and interestingly complexity is very highly evolved 
one of the things i want to do is to help you with a very important task -- which you may not know that you have very often -- which is to understand how to sit next to a physicist at a dinner party and have a conversation  
and the words that i would like you to focus on are complexity and emergence because these will enable you to start the conversation and then daydream about other things 
and that's complexity 
all right so let me give you an example of simplicity of a particular kind 
the question is why is binary simpler than arabic 
and this is a map of bitflows across the continent 
that is you can stack them 
and you put a drop in this case of urine at the bottom 
it turns colors in this particular case you're reading kidney function 
if you take too much out of something that's simple you lose function 
so you can't make it too simple 
and the second is a design issue and it's not directly relevant but it's a nice statement 
so what i think one can begin to do with this kind of cut at the word simplicity which doesn't cover brancusi it doesn't answer the question of why mondrian is better or worse or simpler or less simpler than van gogh and certainly doesn't address the question of whether mozart is simpler than bach 
you've got a company set up to  
i want to open by quoting einstein's wonderful statement just so people will feel at ease that the great scientist of the 20th century also agrees with us and also calls us to this action 
i know the next buddha will come a few thousand years from now but exists currently in a certain heaven -- that's maitreya -- so i'm going to go on a retreat and i'm going to meditate and pray until the buddha maitreya reveals himself to me and gives me a teaching or something to revive the practice of compassion in the world today 
and the man said really and he showed him a dish full of needles 
so he said okay i get the point 
he went back to his cave he meditated again 
another three years no vision he leaves again 
so he thought i will take the maggots and put them on this piece of flesh then clean the dog's wounds and then i'll figure out what to do with the maggots 
so he starts to do that he can't grab the maggots 
he jumps back and there of course is the future buddha maitreya in a beautiful vision -- rainbow lights golden jeweled a plasma body an exquisite mystic vision -- that he sees 
so as he comes up from his first bow he says my lord i'm so happy to see you but where have you been for 12 years 
and maitreya says i was with you who do you think was making needles and making nests and dripping on rocks for you mister dense 
looking for the buddha in person he said 
so naturally they chased him out of town 
you gave me that expression the eternal mama you said that's wonderful 
so they first create this foundation of equality 
and we don't hate anyone therefore so we equalize that's very important 
and this is the way you do it you take any being who looks weird to you and you see how they could be familiar to you 
you reduce the feeling of otherness about beings 
and then you connect that with your feeling that everyone has that motherly possibility 
and they then never get any positive feedback 
compassion makes you happy 
the first person who is happy when you get great compassion is yourself even if you haven't done anything yet for anybody else 
because traditional economic theory would say well the mountain bike was probably invented by some big bike corporation that had a big r&ampd lab where they were thinking up new projects and it came out of there it didn't come from there 
the ideas are coming back from the consumers and they're often ahead of the producers 
the very first landline telephones the inventors thought that they would be used for people to listen in to live performances from west end theaters 
more and more the inventors of things will not be able to say that in advance 
the second reason why users are more and more important is that they are the source of big disruptive innovations 
take astronomy as an example which yochai has already mentioned 
what does this mean then for our organizational landscape 
let me just give you two examples 
which venture capitalist in their right mind is going to give you any money to set up a venture competing with microsoft with microsoft outlook no one 
because the professionals over here in these closed organizations -- they might be academics they might be programmers they might be doctors they might be journalists -- my former profession -- say no no -- you can't trust these people over here 
they want to as jimmy said they want to have a dialogue a conversation 
what should be the role of public policy 
and i was having dinner with this guy called timothy chan 
didn't go into the internet kept his money decided to go into computer games 
at any one time there are four million people playing one of his games 
how many people does he employ to service that population 
well how can he service 250 million people from 500 employees 
imagine you could take all the children in education in britain and one percent of them were co-developers of education 
or if you got one percent of the patients in the nhs to in some sense be co-producers of health 
for example i get people to dress up their vacuum cleaners 
and i figured i'd put it on the internet for all employees under stress to help you better deal with what you're going through on your job 
and so i said let's put this together in an album 
we can build all sorts of environments to make it a little bit easier but ultimately what we're trying to do is really connect with one other person 
recording okay here's something 
but sometimes i feel really lonely 
like even people in convenience stores saying have a nice day when they're accidentally looking me in the eye 
and i got a lot like 30 in a half an hour 
i was like i don't know 
but anyway this same person laura ended up emailing me a little bit after that project 
so i asked her what does it feel like when you feel this way 
i said okay i'll think about it 
and when you put them together something magical happens something absolutely incredible happens and all of a sudden i get a chorus from around the world 
and over the past 35 years i've studied behavior on the basis of everything from genes through neurotransmitters dopamine things like that all the way through circuit analysis 
it's really a very precisely timed thing 
so there is the pattern that every one of them had but they all were a little different too 
a key thing is that the major violence genes it's called the mao-a gene 
it's on the x chromosome and so in this way you can only get it from your mother 
and what i think might happen in these areas of the world where we have constant violence you end up having generations of kids that are seeing all this violence 
now i said okay so what we have lizzie 
but it doesn't stop there 
but there's gonna be bad news somewhere 
it's the biggest scientific experiment ever attempted 
so you might be asking why 
absolutely everything 
actually if you just look at your thumbnail -- about a square centimeter -- there are something like 60 billion neutrinos per second from the sun passing through every square centimeter of your body 
and these particles have been discovered over the last century pretty much 
one of the wonderful things actually i find is that we've discovered any of them when you realize how tiny they are 
so one of my most illustrious forebears at manchester university ernest rutherford discoverer of the atomic nucleus once said all science is either physics or stamp collecting 
now i don't think he meant to insult the rest of science although he was from new zealand so it's possible 
but imagine someone who's not very popular moves through the room 
the picture is that the electrons and the quarks in your body and in the universe that we see around us are heavy in a sense and massive because they're surrounded by higgs particles 
this is a creation story i think equally as wonderful 
so that's the lhc 
when i grew up and realized that science fiction was not a good source for superpowers i decided instead to embark on a journey of real science to find a more useful truth 
by measuring their student smiles researchers were able to predict how fulfilling and long-lasting a subject's marriage will be how well she would score on standardized tests of well-being and how inspiring she would be to others 
outside of this room more than a third of us smile more than 20 times per day whereas less than 14 percent of us smile less than five 
the finding supported darwin's theory by showing that facial feedback modifies the neural processing of emotional content in the brain in a way that helps us feel better when we smile 
it is a user-appropriate technology that has been used for humanitarian good to great effect 
the grassroots has been strengthened through the social power of sharing and they are challenging the old models the old analog models of control and command 
if you were to arrive in nairobi today and pick up a tourist map kibera is represented as a lush green national park devoid of human settlement 
they're normally backroom or basement hardware service providers but they need to be elevated to software strategists 
but if you're like me my humanity is more like a window 
then suddenly i see it and usually it's never good 
my mother was english 
she was five foot two very feisty and very english 
this is how english my mother is -- or was she just passed 
and then we went to a fish restaurant and we had chad the surfer dude serving us and he came up and my mother said do you have any specials young man 
and my mother turned to me and said what language is he speaking 
but her igbo wasn't too good 
so here are these women who never discuss their period with their husbands and here i am telling them well how often do you get your period 
it was my mother with five little children 
can you imagine this five-foot-two woman standing up to men with guns who want to kill us 
and she said you know you can steel your heart against any kind of trouble any kind of horror 
and then the next planting season when they sang the dirge they would remove as many names of the dead that equaled as many people that were born 
which would seem to suggest that apartheid was entirely the business of men 
their humanity never seems to matter very much to us 
and a lot of rituals involved killing killing little animals progressing along so when i turned 13 -- and i mean it made sense it was an agrarian community somebody had to kill the animals there was no whole foods you could go and get kangaroo steak at -- so when i turned 13 it was my turn now to kill a goat 
now when i was growing up he used to tell me stories about how he used to bayonet people and their intestines would fall out but they would keep running 
but he was desperate to show that he'd just come back so he summoned me up and he said go into the bedroom my bedroom 
that's basically how this thing operates 
so one of the advantages of this design is when you scale things down the robot naturally becomes agile 
it's inversely proportional to r 
no matter how you throw it the robot recovers and comes back to him 
so here are robots carrying beams columns and assembling cube-like structures 
so you might want to have multiple robots carry payloads 
so we use a little trick 
they sense their neighbors 
so again the robots monitor this error and calculate the control commands 100 times a second which then translates to the motor commands 600 times a second 
as you can see here they collapse from a three-dimensional formation into planar formation 
another application i want to show you -- again this is in our lab 
so his algorithm essentially tells these robots how to autonomously build cubic structures from truss-like elements 
so all these experiments you've seen thus far all these demonstrations have been done with the help of motion capture systems 
it figures out where it is with respect to the features and then estimates its position 100 times a second allowing us to use the control algorithms that i described to you earlier 
you will see nine robots play six different instruments 
let's watch 
unless you're on one of these californian low-carb diets bread is standard 
and i think it is because we feel that this kind of bread really is about authenticity 
and this is about good taste good traditions 
but we have somehow in the course of the last few centuries or even decades started to cultivate an image of a mythical rural agricultural past 
so what is happening 
bread has migrated to tropical countries where the middle classes now eat french rolls and hamburgers and where the commuters find bread much more handy to use than rice or cassava 
this is where it all comes from and where these farmers who actually ten thousand years ago put us on the road of bread 
let's go back to traditional farming 
and i'm making a real plea here 
we've moved towards large-scale and very high control 
what i want us to do is to keep up the science and even get more science in there but go to a kind of regional scale -- not just in terms of the scale of the fields but in terms of the entire food network 
so what kind of science can we have 
we cannot solve the world food problem by using biological agriculture 
everything is linked together 
understand that you are part of this enormous chain of events 
and as you eat it and as you try it -- please come and stand up 
every meal you eat contains ingredients from all across the world 
and that i think evolutionarily-speaking is unique 
and today is a time for me to talk to you about water 
this crocodile which grows to almost 20 feet long in the northern rivers and this charismatic snake the king cobra 
and it really works to start with them 
the people of this part of india worship the king cobra 
it's just a wresting match but a remarkable activity 
and now the king cobra is a new one 
it survived even during the time that the dinosaurs died off 
in fact if you see the map the range of their original habitat was all the way from the indus in pakistan to the irrawaddy in burma 
and pretty soon we were seeing sights like this 
this was actually just taken last year 
my pals in the crocodile specialist group of the iucn the [madras crocodile bank] an ngo the world wildlife fund the wildlife institute of india state forest departments and the ministry of environment we all work together on stuff 
so it seemed that the toxin that was killing the gharial was something in the food chain something in the fish they were eating 
but poolan devi was one [of them] which actually shekhar kapur made an incredible movie the bandit queen which i urge you to see 
so who is next us 
we've got a lot of a good team of people working up there 
so we can do it 
and there is a gharial looking at us from the river 
namaste 
i look at it as a creature who is totally frightened of something so dangerous as a human being 
you were saying that that hasn't been filmed before 
and the guy who is working there with them he's from maharashtra he said i think he's after the nusha 
whenever he eats the pit viper he gets this little venom rush 
to me that’s the real natural wonder 
and the insurance companies found that they began to save almost 30000 dollars per patient and medicare is now in the middle of doing a demonstration project where they’re paying for 1800 people to go through the program on the sites that we train 
and i’ll talk more about this but the real epidemic isn’t just heart disease or obesity or smoking -- it’s loneliness and depression 
and the pain is not the problem it’s the symptom 
what was the biggest selling drug of all time when it was introduced a few years ago 
so the very behaviors that we think of as being so sexy in our culture are the very ones that leave so many people feeling tired lethargic depressed and impotent and that’s not much fun 
your sexual function improves 
when you eat a big fatty meal how do you feel 
you feel kind of sleepy afterwards 
these are not election returns these are the percentage of people who are overweight 
he says i’ve got some good news 
what we found was that after a year none of the experimental group patients who made these lifestyle changes needed treatment whereas six of the control-group patients needed surgery or radiation 
and then i wondered was there any relationship between how much people changed their diet and lifestyle -- whichever group they were in -- and the changes in psa 
the last thing i want to talk about apropos of the issue of the pursuit of happiness is that study after study have shown that people who are lonely and depressed -- and depression is the other real epidemic in our culture -- are many times more likely to get sick and die prematurely in part because as we talked about they’re more likely to smoke and overeat and drink too much and work too hard and so on 
it can be sexual intimacy – i happen to think that healing energy and erotic energy are just different forms of the same thing 
and at the end of it somebody said hey swami what’s the difference between wellness and illness 
and so he went up on the board and he wrote the word illness and circled the first letter and then wrote the word wellness and circled the first two letters  
and along the way they created a breakthrough in computer visualization 
hopefully it won't stutter 
and if we did our jobs well you won't know that we were even involved 
some you could see some you couldn't 
now there's no use of prosthetic makeup or photography of brad superimposed over another actor's body 
now fincher is an interesting guy 
and so david had an interesting take on the film and he threw a challenge at us 
we went through a process of elimination and a process of discovery with david and we ruled out of course swapping actors 
but we used lots of cheats and shortcuts 
we really felt like we were in a -- kind of a 12-step program 
and of course the first step is admit you've got a problem  
so we needed a system that would allow benjamin to do everything a human being can do 
and we realized that there was a giant chasm between the state of the art of technology in 2004 and where we needed it to be 
the state of the art at the time was something called marker-based motion capture 
but we also looked at numbers of other films at the time that were using facial marker tracking and that's the idea of putting markers on the human face and doing the same process 
we needed the subtleties of the skin 
we needed creases and dimples and wrinkles and all of those things 
so clearly we were in a substantially better place for this 
we measure complexity and fidelity of data in terms of polygonal count 
this was the breakthrough 
this is brad doing one of the ekman facs poses 
we shot him with four hd cameras so we'd get multiple views of him and then david would choose the take of brad being benjamin that he thought best matched the footage with the rest of the cast 
and here you can see the body actor 
we also had to create an eye system 
he was very popular 
there were no animators necessary to come in and interpret behavior or enhance his performance 
so as things went through this process fincher would always say it sandblasts the edges off of the performance 
so it sees a smile as a smile 
but we ended up calling the entire process and all the technology emotion capture as opposed to just motion capture 
their teeth are basically bashed out with a metal rod 
and we said okay here is some seed fund 
the women were just not allowed to come out of the community and work with mainstream society so we were able to address that 
we rescued over 550 dancing bears 
now the end product of that action is up on the board here 
when i started talking to richard about what i was going to speak about i had recently come back from jordan where i had an amazing experience with a camel 
the guys got out they put the hood up they started working under the hood got it going again about a hundred yards it broke down 
and they said ah no problem we just get out and walk 
and they said yeah yeah we'll walk we'll find some camels 
so we'll need to be very careful around him don't let him get you 
when they're in rut -- they're similar to seals in the way like a seal has to open its nose to breathe 
they use them to pinpoint sound 
the desert's extremely windy as well as being very cold 
but they use their tails a lot especially in rut 
but on this particular occasion it was very very clear that as horny as suki was jasmine was having none of it 
so i'm going to show you another film 
but before i do i just want to mention that this animal truly is a sort of the suv of the sand the ship of the desert it's so vital to the inhabitants of the areas in which the camel is found -- largely mongolia and sahara -- that there are 160 words in arabic to describe the camel 
and if this is a creature that was designed by committee it's certainly been like no committee i've ever been on 
so here's what suki would do in search of a mate 
i'm ted camel 
i'm smartly designed 
a distinguished nose with nostrils lined to filter out sand and dust and a groove that catches moisture 
leathery chest pads that beat the heat 
i'm able to lose 40 percent of my weight without dying 
humans -- the animal -- are pretty lucky creatures because by and large we really don't have to adapt to our environment we adapt our environment to us 
but this creature that you've just seen ultimately adapts and keeps adapting and adapting 
and the idea was to have me record some of my poems and then they would find animators to animate them 
writing is not actually as easy as that for me 
poetry just says a few things in different ways 
some days i put the people in their places at the table bend their legs at the knees if they come with that feature and fix them into the tiny wooden chairs 
the name of the author is the first to go followed obediently by the title the plot the heartbreaking conclusion the entire novel which suddenly becomes one you have never read never even heard of 
it's called the country 
and that to me was a bad start to the afterlife having to witness your own funeral and feel gratified 
if it has a subject the subject is adolescence 
frankly who cares if annie oakley was a crack shot at 15 or if maria callas debuted as tosca at 17 
and here comes a second follower 
now it's not a lone nut it's not two nuts -- three is a crowd and a crowd is news 
i was listening to all the experts and talking to sort of a board of medical advisers 
i wrote the book on a treadmill and it took me about a thousand miles to write the book 
i also tried to be the safest person i could be because that's a part of health 
now it's a little extreme i admit 
but if you think about this this is actually -- the freakonomics authors wrote about this -- that more people die on a per mile basis from drunk walking than from drunk driving 
without the sex part 
and i finally have stabilized 
and i of course don't have time to go into all of them 
it really impairs cognition 
so without noise reduction technology our country would not exist 
and you can almost trick yourself into thinking you're eating doritos 
that's my greatest hope 
what might they find 
here's a replica of one such seal 
we need to decipher the script to answer that question 
in fact the script has become a battleground of sorts between three different groups of people 
if you look at a map of india today you'll see that most of the languages spoken in north india belong to the indo-european language family 
first there's no rosetta stone 
and furthermore we don't even know what language they spoke 
and to make matters even worse most of the text that we have are extremely short 
and why was i fascinated 
and i'd like to describe some of the results that we have found 
i'll give you a couple of seconds 
languages contain patterns 
language on the other hand has an intermediate level of entropy it's neither too rigid nor is it too random 
here's a graph that plots the entropies of a whole bunch of sequences 
we found that the indus script actually falls within the range of the linguistic scripts 
who'd have thought that deciphering could be a dangerous profession 
so as the old saying goes if it looks like a linguistic script and it acts like a linguistic script then perhaps we may have a linguistic script on our hands 
so as an example here's a word 
okay great 
so this is just like a crossword puzzle except that this is the mother of all crossword puzzles because the stakes are so high if you solve it 
it contains seven vertical strokes followed by this fish-like sign 
and it turns out that in india there's a long tradition of names being based on horoscopes and star constellations present at the time of birth 
similarly there's another sequence of six stars and that translates to aru meen which is the old dravidian name for the star constellation pleiades 
so that was pretty exciting 
but whilst we have an overwhelmingly vivid visual understanding of space we have no sense of what space sounds like 
now this story doesn't start with vast telescopes or futuristic spacecraft but a rather more humble technology -- and in fact the very medium which gave us the telecommunications revolution that we're all part of today the telephone 
thomas watson spent hours listening to the strange crackles and hisses and chirps and whistles that his accidental antenna detected 
they turned out to be lightning or sources of electrical power 
there was a glitch in their soundtrack 
we do enjoy our misery in a certain way 
because our egocentric perception -- from the buddha's point of view misperception -- is that all we are is what is inside our skin 
and everyone here is unfortunately carrying that habitual perception a little bit right 
like even when you're having a good time when is the good time over 
i think the dalai lama should have heard that i wish he'd been there to hear that 
everybody has the wrong idea they think buddha was so boring and they're so surprised when they meet dalai lama and he's fairly jolly 
the human being is almost out of time 
this is birhan who was the ethiopian girl who launched live aid in the 1980s 15 minutes away from death when she was rescued and that picture of her being rescued is one that went round the world 
and what do all these pictures and events have in common 
what they have in common is what we see unlocks what we cannot see 
what we see unlocks the invisible ties and bonds of sympathy that bring us together to become a human community 
go back 200 years when the slave trade was under pressure from william wilberforce and all the protesters 
they won public opinion over a long period of time 
what could they have done with the pictures that they could have shown if they were able to use the modern means of communication to win people’s hearts and minds 
i was with nelson mandela a year ago when he was in london 
i have just been talking to the president of sierra leone 
i met her in a field she was ragged she had no shoes 
we must then build a proper relationship between the richest and the poorest countries based on our desire that they are able to fend for themselves with the investment that is necessary in their agriculture so that africa is not a net importer of food but an exporter of food 
making people laugh 
so please send me your ideas about how to design a foot 
we have to first know what a foot is 
and i want you to help me do that in this next clip 
see any common themes principles 
now it turns out that animals can go anywhere 
if you want to study how a foot works we're going to have to simulate those surfaces or simulate that debris 
without a foot here's what it does it doesn't even slow down 
that's a bipedal octopus that's disguised as a rolling coconut 
now you might have noticed something else about the animals when they were running over the rough terrain 
boy spiny 
do we really understand that principle of tuning the answer is yes 
but look at this animal do it 
and you probably feel them if you grabbed it 
these are all from different insects 
let's look at that ant 
you see what happens 
so to our blueprint we stick on some sticky pads 
these are its feet 
it has a hundred to a thousand split ends and that's the secret because it allows intimate contact 
here you are pulling off the band-aid 
here's the new project we're trying to create the first climbing search-and-rescue robot -- no suction or magnets -- that can only move on limited kinds of surfaces 
and here it is coming up at you in its first steps up a wall 
and that's exactly what he's done 
thank you 
the first thing that got me interested in the sounds of these underwater animals whose world was so foreign to me was evidence from captive dolphins that captive dolphins could imitate human sounds 
this is a picture of a trainer's whistle a whistle a trainer will blow to tell a dolphin it's done the right thing and can come get a fish 
many mammals have to produce contact calls when say a mother and calf are apart 
what this figure shows is the percentage of the separations in which dolphins whistle against the maximum distance 
so when dolphins are separating by less than 20 meters less than half the time they need to use whistles 
most of the time they can just find each other just by swimming around 
and two boats when the second boat was added what happened was that some of the dolphins left the area completely 
we may need to regulate the intensity of recreational boating and actual whale watching in order to prevent these kinds of problems 
this is a kind of map we've all been looking at 
so you're listening to the complicated song produced by humpbacks here 
and this orange line here marks the typical songs of east coast humpbacks 
it's loud clear -- you can hear it very clearly 
but you can still hear that faint call 
this is a figure from a textbook on underwater sound 
now think about it this is an amazing thing that in this frequency range where whales communicate the main source globally on our planet for the noise comes from human ships thousands of human ships distant far away just all aggregating 
same thing in the north atlantic in the '50s versus 2000 
so we have to be very concerned about when the noise in habitats degrades the habitat enough that the animals either have to pay too much to be able to communicate or are not able to perform critical functions 
if you actually insulate and isolate the machinery of the ship from the hull you can reduce that noise by 99 percent 
what maersk did is they worked ways to slow down 
and third you can create your own tours -- you can share them with friends you can create them with friends -- and that's the part that i think i'm most excited about because i think that at heart we are all storytellers 
curtis wong thank you roy 
so microsoft -- this is a project that -- worldwide telescope is dedicated to jim gray who's our colleague and a lot of his work that he did is really what makes this project possible 
and so what you've seen today is less than a fraction of one percent of what is in here and in the ted lab we have a tour that was created by a six-year-old named benjamin that will knock your socks off  
two-thirds of all students in special ed remedial programs are guys 
and we're seeing a steady increase among males 
they're also totally out of sync in romantic relationships which build gradually and subtly 
i can create big things out here but i can go back and really quickly go back to where i started and make even smaller things here 
but the neat thing about it is i can add control points 
i mean this technique of being able to manipulate a mesh here with multiple control points is actually something that's state of the art 
don't worry 
what we don't agree on is what the problem actually is 
i think none of these is the problem 
we want to go on with our daily life even though we are not living under normal circumstances 
in the end benjamín and julián decided the best thing they could do was to organize the community and act together 
that devotion we feel for the national football team 
we need men and women who love mexico and who are willing to take action 
the battle is won but we still have to fight it 
juggling three balls is simple and normal 
ok then you've got to combine them because then you have the whole spatial palette in front of you 
and then you get crazy 
now i'm actually going to ask you to try something so you've got to pay attention complexity if you spend enough time doing something time slows down or your skill increases so your perceptions change 
things slow down as you learn as you learn as you learn 
so complexity now how many here are jugglers 
ok so most of you are going to have a similar reaction to this 
no it looks like a mess it looks like a mess with a guy there who's got his hands around that mess ok 
it's being able to do something that other people can't do or can't understand 
all right so that's one way of doing it which is five balls down 
make it wider 
make it narrower 
enough of a clue so you get the pattern right ok 
pink 
so white ball and -- finger finger finger finger finger finger finger finger pink 
finger finger finger pink or finger 
i don't need music for it talking about time in a moment 
ahhh 
so a moment 
ok and then what i did as a juggler was say ok what can i do to make that something that is dependent on something else another dynamic 
so a moment 
are we ready to do that yes 
now i'm going to show you the beginnings of a piece that is about balance in some ways and also -- oh actually if you're bored not here here's one use for it 
two sticks you can go with it thanks 
it's a combination of that the beauty of that the shape and the stories that were involved in it as well as the fact that they protected the contents 
and it's going to change as i go through it 
i thought it [would] kind of be interesting to think back to that time when richard got the whole thing started thank you very much richard it's been a big enjoyable part of my life coming here 
and so it was great fun in those days and some of those of you who are in the audience were my clients 
we'd come in with some prototype underneath a black cloth and we'd put it on the conference table and we'd pull off the black cloth and everybody would ooh and ah 
that was a really good time 
but something's happened in the last 18 years since richard started ted and that's that people like us -- i know people in other places have caught onto this for a long time but for us we've really just started  we've kind of climbed maslow's hierarchy a little bit -- and so we're now focused more and more on human-centered design human-centeredness in an approach to design 
and i think you're starting to see that and it's making our job even more enjoyable 
and so in order to do that we've been forming internal video-production groups in order to make these kind of experience prototypes that show just what we mean about the man-machine relationship 
it's kind of like architects who show people in their houses as opposed to them being empty 
so you can see what you look like from the back or all the way around as you look 
this is cbs sunday morning that aired about two weeks ago 
and my favorite feature which is a flower in a vase that wilts when you leave in disappointment and then when you come back it comes up to greet you happy to see you 
the dome has an incredible amount of water that washes off of it as well as wastewater 
the pavilion's design goal was to be kind of quiet and peaceful 
it can dive to 500 feet to where sunlight does not penetrate and is equipped with powerful lights 
(narrator and this central box connects the whole system together 
and so by doing that the woman that you saw in the first thing -- she's a school teacher -- always wanted to send her kids to college and she's going to be able to do it because of these things 
as in this cryptic sentence i found in the guardian recently the marriage suffered a setback in 1965 when the husband was killed by the wife 
we can't see into the engine room 
electrons disappear in a kind of fuzz and there is only energy and you can't see energy 
not only is she aware of her physical repulsiveness she turns it to her advantage 
so he went out and bought a plastic frame to put the photograph in 
so one of the interesting things about invisibility is that things that we can't see we also can't understand 
but we can't read each other's minds i find that quite astonishing 
but their main exercise of telepathy is to send out powerful signals to the rest of us that it doesn't exist 
and this is increasingly peculiar because about 20 years ago when they started delving into the genome they thought it would probably contain around 100000 genes 
you can't see these things but they are very strange 
because that's where all the stuff happens  that makes you who you are 
this is fascinating you probably know some of you that cells are continually renewed you can see it in skin and this kind of stuff 
but every cell in your body is replaced at some point 
livers and internal organs sort of take a bit longer a spine takes several years 
there is so many things that -- light 
five out of the 100 billion galaxies with the naked eye and one of them is quite difficult to see unless you've got very good eyesight 
what the others are here for i've no idea 
so we were thinking well the best way to learn from them is to read all of these millions of books 
now the problem is there's an x-axis for that which is the practical axis 
this is extremely practical but not so awesome 
now again we kind of caved in and we did the very practical approach which was a bit less awesome 
we said well instead of releasing the full text we're going to release statistics about the books 
it's four words we call that a four-gram 
well which one should i use 
as of about six months ago the state of the art in this field is that you would for instance go up to the following psychologist with fabulous hair and you'd say steve you're an expert on the irregular verbs 
so if you want to become famous early on you should be an actor because then fame starts rising by the end of your 20s -- you're still young it's really great 
one mistake you should not do is become a mathematician 
here's a simple way to do it 
so for instance here -- this suppression index is for 5000 people picked in english books where there's no known suppression -- it would be like this basically tightly centered on one 
what you expect is basically what you observe 
but much more importantly the distribution is much wider 
it's the application of massive-scale data collection analysis to the study of human culture 
there's various types of frustration 
this person studies all the arghs from one through eight a's 
these all happen to be on our computers on computers across the world 
and when that happens that will transform the way we have to understand our past our present and human culture 
one of them is pattern recognition 
we listen to differences we discount sounds that remain the same 
why did i say that 
well there are a lot of reasons for this 
and the art of conversation is being replaced -- dangerously i think -- by personal broadcasting 
and only without conscious listening can these things happen -- a world where we don't listen to each other at all is a very scary place indeed 
it's a great exercise for improving the quality of your listening 
so mundane sounds can be really interesting if you pay attention 
you can use this in listening in communication 
why is it not taught it's crazy 
thank you for listening to me today 
so what happened was when i was young and got out of engineering school at cornell in '79 i decided -- i went to work for intel and i was in the computer industry -- and three months into that i fell in love with something else and i said i made the wrong career choice here and i fell in love with brains 
we are in the pre-paradigm days if you want to use thomas kuhn 
and theory has not played a role in any sort of grand way in the neurosciences 
you're more complicated than your brain you've got a brain 
that's always been the case and so all we can say well my neocortex which is the part of the brain i'm interested in has 30 billion cells 
the best minds were stumped -- really really smart people 
it just turns out it's really hard to think of things but once you've thought of them it's kind of easy to understand it 
so it was intuitive and obvious now what about evolution 
and i'm going to work you through this in a few slides here give you an example of what this means here's a system 
and alan turing defined the turing test which is essentially saying we'll know if something's intelligent if it behaves identical to a human 
a behavioral metric of what intelligence is and this has stuck in our minds for a long period of time 
you're not aware of this but your eyes are always moving 
it's not always true but in general there's not a good history of theory in biology 
not like computer memory it's not at all like computer memory 
you cannot learn or recall anything outside of a sequence 
if you don't build it you don't understand it so one more slide here 
the new brain is actually kind of easier than the old brain 
but ultimately the world's the limit here 
i don't know how this is going to turn out 
they couldn't anticipate cell phones and the internet and all this kind of stuff 
i do not think about what i consider to be peace which is sustainable peace with justice and equality 
but he's offering 84 billion dollars for the modernizing of nuclear weapons 
in global terms it's a little bit of money 
but it's going to modernize weapons we do not need and will not be gotten rid of in our lifetime unless we get up off our  
i was in hiroshima a couple of weeks ago and his holiness -- we're sitting there in front of thousands of people in the city and there were about eight of us nobel laureates 
we're staring at everybody waiting our turn to speak and he leans over to me and he says jody i'm a buddhist monk 
i spoke with aung sun suu kyi a couple of days ago 
she said you know we have a long road to go to finally get democracy in my country 
here's another woman hero of mine 
she says the airports of the world 
they call her the tree lady but she's more than the tree lady 
this is rigoberta menchu tum 
it's not a dirty word 
it's hard work every single day 
and then when she closed the door grandma said no no no no 
and they also when they want to travel they use flying machines that can take them to remote destinations 
and they want the washing machine 
so how come [this is] something that everyone uses and they think others will not stop it what is special with this 
and over there they don't even use one each 
what are the trends if we just prolong the trends without any real advanced analysis to 2050 there are two things that can increase the energy use 
and these 22 units -- still the richest people use most of it 
they must change behavior in some way 
they must also start to produce green energy much more green energy 
i was like okay that's social skill 
you go to an elementary school at three in the afternoon and you watch the kids come out and they're wearing these 80-pound backpacks 
another finding is that the unconscious far from being dumb and sexualized is actually quite smart 
and the way you should do that is study the furniture let it marinate in your mind distract yourself and then a few days later go with your gut because unconsciously you've figured it out 
now i'm a middle-aged guy 
they put them into a brain scan machine -- this is apocryphal by the way but i don't care -- and they had them watch a horror movie and then they had them describe their feelings toward their wives 
they have trouble relating to other people 
ninety-five percent of our professors report that they are above-average teachers 
they have epistemological modesty 
they are open-minded in the face of ambiguity 
the third trait is metis what we might call street smarts -- it's a greek word 
and that comes in tremendously handy because groups are smarter than individuals 
what picasso did for example was take the concept western art and the concept african masks and blend them together -- not only the geometry but the moral systems entailed in them 
and these are skills again we can't count and measure 
just to let you know i do not have a lexicographical whistle 
but people think that my job is to let the good words make that difficult left-hand turn into the dictionary and keep the bad words out 
and it's not very fun and when parts of your job are not easy or fun you kind of look for an excuse not to do them 
but why do people want me to direct traffic when i would much rather go fishing 
why do i blame the queen 
so he's really responsible for a lot of what we consider modern in dictionaries today 
i mean i'm a huge geek i love computers 
it's steampunk what we have is an electric velocipede 
online dictionaries must be different 
this is flat look how many links there are in the actual entry two 
so it's not that we have good words and bad words 
some of my best friends are books 
how can you say that a sledgehammer is better than a ball-peen hammer 
so if we're not worrying about directing traffic if we've transcended paper if we are worrying less about control and more about description then we can think of the english language as being this beautiful mobile 
if only one out of every 10 of those books had a word that's not in the dictionary in it that would be equivalent to more than two unabridged dictionaries 
you know it's pretty to look at for a while but then it dies 
we can leave the aesthetic judgments to the writers and the speakers 
i was 15 when i was gang-raped by eight men 
but the rest who succumb into it go through everyday torture 
these are men who buy you for an hour for a day and use you throw you 
and we are silent about them 
but the extra bonuses that she gets is various infections sexually transmitted infections hiv aids syphilis gonorrhea you name it substance abuse drugs everything under the sun 
and therefore my challenge was to understand how can i get out the power from this pain 
what has been my challenge 
my biggest challenge is society 
it's you and me 
but it is not nice to bring them to our homes 
so i'm just going to grab a chair here 
i had this company that i'd spent 15 years building it's called future it was a magazine publishing company 
it had recently gone public and the market said that it was apparently worth two billion dollars a number i didn't really understand 
the date was february 2000 
i mean it had to right i was in for quite a surprise 
i watched my own net worth falling by about a million dollars a day every day for 18 months 
turns out that the research done on that is absolutely mind-blowing 
it's the total brain experience we're going to  
so i will here's the vision for ted 
this is a video prototype 
and they don't react to background sounds 
and we were quite intrigued with playing with the notion of invisibility 
soren enters the room pop he goes invisible 
so people would walking into the room and they'd almost ignore it thinking it was some crap laying around 
so this work is a caricature of an upside-down man 
because if that circle weren't there and the floor was very even it would start to wander about in the space 
that's my colleague he's let it go 
and if it isn't easily gotten we'll go ahead and steal it 
while the carbon dioxide vast quantities of it gigatons goes into the atmosphere where we can't get it back -- yet -- and where it is causing the problems that we're most concerned about 
they've run out of good sites 
babcock &amp wilcox that make nuclear reactors here's an integral fast reactor 
co2e emissions are equivalent emissions of all the greenhouse gases and particles that cause warming and converted to co2 
we have facilities around there you also have a buffer zone that's 17 square kilometers 
and you have the uranium mining that you have to deal with 
there are two nations north korea and israel that have nuclear weapons and don't have nuclear power at all 
there's plenty of solar and wind 
that's from real data 
solving the world's problems can be done if you really put your mind to it and use clean renewable energy 
and in the united states senate we need bipartisan support -- only one or two votes are needed -- to move global warming through the senate and this room can help 
the first is be aware of the propaganda 
and i'm you know very much pro that kind of stuff 
i campaigned against nuclear weapons in the '80s and i continue to do so now 
because five years from now it will blow you away what we'll actually have as alternatives to this horrible disastrous nuclear power 
your final pitch stewart 
okay so thank you mark 
it's during our lifetime that we're going to take the earth take the people of earth and transition off permanently and that's exciting 
in fact i think it is a moral imperative that we open the space frontier 
you know it's the first time that we're going to have a chance to have planetary redundancy a chance to if you would back up the biosphere 
and if you think about space everything we hold of value on this planet -- metals and minerals and real estate and energy -- is in infinite quantities in space 
and we knew nothing about going to space 
we went from having literally put alan shepard in suborbital flight to going to the moon in eight years and the average age of the people that got us there was 26 years old 
the shuttle is costing a billion dollars a launch 
as we are going out there and taking on a new frontier we should be allowed to risk 
in fact anyone who says we shouldn't you know just needs to be put aside because as we go forward in fact the greatest discoveries we will ever know is ahead of us 
and in fact the large corporations the governments can't take the risk 
we've got an altitude call of 368000 feet 
today you can go and experience weightless flights 
orbital flights -- we can take you to the space station 
that was filmed inside our airplane and so you can now do this 
let me talk about the other thing i'm excited about 
it may or may not happen but if you put up a prize the beautiful thing is you know it's a very small maintenance fee and you pay on success 
my work is -- it's a reflection of myself 
we all seem to think that you know if we look down on the ground there's nothing there 
and we use the word nothing 
i told her i couldn't face it because the way the teacher was treating me ridiculing me and using me as an example of failure 
so i told her 
and walked off and i didn't expect that because i expected one of these  
so i'm sitting there thinking 
so i did 
but i thought perhaps the ant won't know it'll probably move in 
and then i sat down and all the ants came along 
it became part of me 
as you can see that's a pinhead 
now that is called the huf haus 
so i'm thinking mr huf isn't going to be very happy when i told him his house has gone to another into the atmosphere somewhere 
so to cut the story short i decided that i had to go back and do it 
so i found some more and i decided to sort of construct it very very slowly holding my breath working between my heartbeat and making sure everything is leveled 
i noticed that the house was occupied 
so basically i'd completed the house 
so i didn't think he was going to throw bart off 
and sometimes they turn into little catapults and things go up in the air 
but i would never do it to a living fly 
even though they get on our nerves i would never kill an insect because all creatures great and small -- there is a hymn that says that 
so i have to be very very careful 
my work rough estimate sometimes five six to seven weeks you can't always anticipate 
as you can see there's an aphid fly there 
i remember one time i was doing it and the window was open 
and then she looked at me 
and i cut off a little flake of gold 
because i had to put the torch on the top 
the flag had to be made out of little strands of gold 
it's almost like doing a surgical operation to get this thing right 
and that was done with a particle from my shirt 
my point is here people have a choice -- just like the indian lady could wear her sari or the japanese woman could wear her kimono 
which is why i prefer the richard wilk analogy of globalizing the local and localizing the global 
and therefore tradition becomes more important not less important 
we're here we're part of a community sharing out ideas and discussing them 
art becomes a very important part of our national identity 
we have done extensive research to ensure that arab and muslim artists and arabs who are not muslims -- not all arabs are muslims by the way -- but we make sure that they are represented in this new institution 
for me it was a new discovery 
now visual expression is just one form of culture integration 
in a similar way we have created the doha film institute 
who are you playing 
the doha tribeca film festival was held at our new cultural hub katara 
i welcome you on board for us to engage and discuss new ideas of how to bring people together through cultural initiatives and discussions 
and in a saying of the koran which to muslims is god speaking to humanity god says to his prophet muhammad -- whom we believe to be the last of a series of prophets beginning with adam including noah including moses including abraham including jesus christ and ending with muhammad -- that we have not sent you o muhammad except as a 'rahmah' except as a source of compassion to humanity 
the esoteric path of islam is more popularly known as sufism or tasawwuf in arabic 
the language differs but the objective is the same 
and therefore for us to be human -- in the greatest sense of what it means to be human in the most joyful sense of what it means to be human -- means that we too have to be proper stewards of the breath of divinity within us and seek to perfect within ourselves the attribute of being of being alive of beingness the attribute of wisdom of consciousness of awareness and the attribute of being compassionate and loving beings 
and i believe personally that we're on the verge and that with the presence and help of people like you here we can bring about the prophecy of isaiah 
my story actually began when i was four years old and my family moved to a new neighborhood in our hometown of savannah georgia 
that's why they were called ape hangers 
and one afternoon i got a call from my doctor 
the next day i came to see him i was like doctor that was a really good joke 
i believe my girls will have plenty of opportunities in their lives i wrote these men 
linda my wife joked that it was like having six different marriage proposals 
and on that first day we were in this youth hostel in a castle 
will you help be their dad 
and i got to the end -- he was crying and i was crying -- and then he looked at me and he said yes 
and as he talked he had that glint in his eye that i first saw back in holland -- the glint that says let's go cow tipping even though we never did tip the cow even though no one tips the cow even though cows don't sleep standing up 
and then i had a 15-hour surgery in which my surgeon dr john healey at memorial sloan-kettering hospital in new york took out my left femur and replaced it with titanium 
and anybody who came to see me had to cover themselves in a mask and cover all of the extraneous parts of their body 
when my wife and i had kids we thought it would be all-hands-on-deck 
instead it was everybody running the other way 
and there was something incredibly profound about sitting down with my closest friends and telling them what they meant to me 
now david is my literary agent 
so one day near the end of my journey i said come on girls let's take a walk across the brooklyn bridge 
we set out on crutches 
and yet for the four million years humans have been walking upright the act is essentially unchanged 
as my physical therapist likes to say every step is a tragedy waiting to happen 
you go slow you get where you're going but you get there with this community you built along the way 
so i stand here today as you see now walking without crutches or a cane 
and last week i had my 18-month scans 
and all the collective minds in this room i dare say can never find a solution for scan-xiety 
i feel that i've fitted in in many ways to some of the things that i've heard 
they're fighting to develop their own way of living within the forest in a world that's clean a world that isn't contaminated a world that isn't polluted 
but of course my real field of expertise lies in an even different kind of civilization -- i can't really call it a civilization 
and i propose to bring into this ted conference as i always do around the world the voice of the animal kingdom 
the chimps -- there's no time to discuss their fascinating lives -- but they have this long childhood five years of suckling and sleeping with the mother and then another three four or five years of emotional dependence on her even when the next child is born 
they can actually live longer than 60 in captivity so we've only done 40 years in the wild so far 
we know that chimpanzees and some other creatures can recognize themselves in mirrors -- self as opposed to other 
they're disappearing for the reasons that all of you in this room know only too well 
and people will pay more for bush-meat as it's called than for domestic meat -- it's culturally preferred 
we can talk about the distant past plan for the distant future discuss ideas with each other so that the ideas can grow from the accumulated wisdom of a group 
and that's not just in the far-away developing world that's everywhere 
somebody said that yesterday 
and roots and shoots is a program for hope 
see the brick walls as all the problems that we've inflicted on this planet 
it isn't something that their parents tell them or their teachers tell them 
that's effective but if they decide themselves we want to clean this river and put the fish back that used to be there 
no violence no bombs no guns 
how many more minutes two one 
and it's been so clear how much you all care about trying to make this world a better place 
it's very encouraging 
and we've talked a lot about that 
and then as i went around the country after that and felt the fear -- the fear that was leading to people feeling they couldn't worry about the environment any more in case they seemed not to be patriotic -- and i was trying to encourage them somebody came up with a little quotation from mahatma gandhi if you look back through human history you see that every evil regime has been overcome by good 
and just after that a woman brought me this little bell and i want to end on this note 
it's in our hands 
if we lead lives where we consciously leave the lightest possible ecological footprints if we buy the things that are ethical for us to buy and don't buy the things that are not we can change the world overnight 
in the laboratory what we want to do is much the same but with on the order of tens of different types of molecules -- so a drastic reduction in complexity but still trying to produce something that looks lifelike 
this is how we can start to make a protocell 
as you know when you put oil and water together they don't mix but through self-assembly we can get a nice oil droplet to form and we can actually use this as a body for our artificial organism or for our protocell as you will see later 
this structure then can organize the formation of a membrane boundary around itself so it can make a body of liquid molecules around itself and that's shown in green here on this micrograph 
it's actually quite lifeless once it forms it doesn't really do anything 
so some things that are missing is for example if you had a flow of energy through a system what we'd want is a protocell that can harvest some of that energy in order to maintain itself much like living systems do 
so i add some food source to the system 
so then we put these protocells together in a single experiment to see what they would do and depending on the conditions we have some protocells on the left that are moving around and it likes to touch the other structures in its environment 
so then i repeated this experiment a bunch of times and one time something very interesting happened 
so since we can make some interesting protocells that we like interesting colors and interesting behaviors and they're very easy to make and they have interesting lifelike properties perhaps these protocells have something to tell us about the origin of life on the earth perhaps these represent an easily accessible step one of the first steps by which life got started on the early earth 
they look really good very nice movement and also they appear to have some kind of behavior where they kind of circle around each other and follow each other similar to what we've seen before -- but again working with just primordial conditions no pure chemicals 
they're even better models of environmental health because not only the same mammalian biology but they share your diet largely 
so they drank as much vodka as they did plain water which was interesting 
i just want to say it was sort of a rule of thumb though there's about two or three fire hydrants on every city block 
they flatten a few plants no big deal they'll regenerate 
that 99 percent of the time when a firetruck is not parking there it's infiltrating pollutants 
so these are small actions that can amount to a significant effect to improve local environmental health 
here's one of them that we have up now 
when a fish swims underneath a light goes on 
this is what it looks like 
so there's another function on here 
and they text back 
in this case instead of throwing chewing gum or doritos or whatever you have in your pocket at the fish -- there's a body of water in iceland that i've been dealing with that's in the middle of the city and the largest pollution burden on it is not the roadborne pollution it's actually white bread from people feeding the fish and the birds 
they're cross-species delicious that is delicious for humans and non-humans 
and you say boy that's a lot 
but you know what 
now if you parked those end to end and wrapped them around the earth that would stretch around the earth 125 times 
and we wanted to take advantage of moore's law with electronic controls and software and we absolutely wanted our car to be connected 
so let me talk about hydrogen first 
the beauty of hydrogen is it can come from so many different sources it can come from fossil fuels it can come from any way that you can create electricity including renewables 
and hydrogen and fuel cells give us that opportunity to actually use our cars and trucks when they're parked to generate electricity for the grid 
and we talked about swarm networks earlier 
actually the theme of this conference i think has hit on really one of the major keys to pull that off -- and that's relationships and working together 
i just want to ask one 
we're into this over a billion dollars already so i would hope people would think we're serious when we're spending that kind of money 
in oxford perhaps we can use lewis carroll and look in the looking glass that is new york city to try and see our true selves or perhaps pass through to another world 
my colleagues and i have been working for 10 years to rediscover this lost world in a project we call the mannahatta project 
and i'd like to tell you the story in three acts and if i have time still an epilogue 
it was once a beach and this painting has john james audubon the painter sitting on the rock 
or this painting from the 1740s from greenwich village 
here's bowling green and here's broadway 
and just beyond it you can see features that have vanished things that have disappeared 
or murray hill and this is the murrays' house on murray hill 200 years ago 
and i thought to myself you know if i could georeference this map if i could place this map in the grid of the city today i could find these lost features of the city in the block-by-block geography that people know the geography of where people go to work and where they go to live and where they like to eat 
then if we added maps like the geology the bedrock geology and the surface geology what the glaciers leave if we make the soil map with the 17 soil classes that are defined by the national conservation service if we make a digital elevation model of the topography that tells us how high the hills were then we can calculate the slopes 
we can calculate the aspect 
the white areas on this map are the places protected from the winter winds 
we compiled all the information about where the native americans were the lenape 
and the old fields the successional fields that go 
it was really an extraordinary landscape that was capable of supporting an extraordinary biodiversity 
as if these were the maps that we would need to predict where you would find the beaver 
an aspen needs fire and dry soils 
but what are the conditions that make it possible 
and these would be the kind of trees that might have been there and the flowers and the lichens and the mosses the butterflies the fish in the stream the birds in the trees 
and perhaps a black bear walked by and maybe native americans were there 
and we used it to try and reveal a landscape here in act iii 
we can see the fields that the native americans made 
so when you're watching law and order and the lawyers walk up the steps they could have walked back down those steps of the new york court house right into the collect pond 400 years ago 
and i think this is what we're learning about building cities in the future 
this is the particular additional habitat requirement of humanity 
fill in the blanks 
unfortunately while this society is without a doubt the most prosperous and dynamic the world has ever created it's got some major major flaws 
clearly we don't have 10 planets 
and they may not want to live exactly like us 
you know so on the one hand we have the unthinkable on the other hand we have the unimaginable 
you know what we're out there doing is looking for examples of tools models and ideas which if widely adopted would change the game 
here for example is vancouver which if you haven't been there you ought to go for a visit it's a fabulous city 
but once you also have people living in close proximity to each other one of the things you can do is -- as information technologies develop -- you can start to have smart places 
they live in the emerging megacities of the developing world 
all throughout the developing world people are going directly to cell phones skipping the whole landline stage 
when you have free ability for people to freely work together and innovate you get different kinds of solutions 
and those solutions are accessible in a different way to people who don't have capital right 
it's doing something new there's new things happening 
you have other radical examples where the ability to use cultural tools is spreading out 
another world is possible 
we tweak that a lot 
we're looking a lot at this this is spreading everywhere 
this is from a force more powerful it's a little screenshot 
these are refrigerators that require no electricity they're pot within a pot design 
how do we help people like that 
audience it detects landmines 
if you are living in one of the places where the roughly half-billion unaccounted for mines are scattered you can fling these seeds out into the field 
and policing copyright violations for children's birthday cakes was such a hassle that the college bakery said you know what we're getting out of that business 
if you're an amateur you don't have access to our machine anymore 
so the policing layer around the problem becomes the real threat of the act 
and the back story is this sopa and pipa as legislation were drafted largely by media companies that were founded in the 20th century 
and congress did something 
and that law was called the audio home recording act of 1992 
so when the audio home recording act of 1992 was passed the media businesses gave up on the idea of legal versus illegal distinctions for copying because it was clear that if congress was acting in their framework they might actually increase the rights of citizens to participate in our own media environment 
it was a complicated piece of legislation a lot of moving parts 
that is a side effect of their ordinary operation 
every dvd player and game player and television and computer you brought home -- no matter what you thought you were getting when you bought it -- could be broken by the content industries if they wanted to set that as a condition of selling you the content 
so this is the internet they have in mind 
imagine it says ted because the comments can't be policed at any acceptable cost 
and if you're not an american citizen you can contact american citizens that you know and encourage them to do the same 
and the dmca goes back to the audio home recording act which horrified those industries 
they just want the sharing to go away 
the whole world is laid out for you the best jobs are laid out for you and you want to go and work in a village 
what the poor thought was important would be reflected in the college 
you failed in your exam 
the education system in india makes you look at paris and new delhi and zurich what are you doing in this village 
you have to have a dignity of labor 
a traditional midwife is a professional 
and it's the only college where we don't give a certificate 
so when i said that they said well show us what is possible what are you doing 
the men should clear out because we don't want to share this technology with the men 
it's the only college which is fully solar-electrified 
so long as the sun shines we'll have no problem with power 
and we have 60 meals twice a day of solar cooking 
she looks after 20 goats in the morning but she's prime minister in the evening 
wasn't dazzled at all by what was happening 
where the percentage of illiteracy is very high we use puppetry 
why because they want to leave the village and go to a city looking for a job 
comes back goes into the village says well what's the story 
they said these two grandmothers   grandmothers the minister couldn't believe what was happening 
went straight to the president 
so he summoned me and said can you train me 150 grandmothers 
i said yeah she is very beautiful 
and when i went back six months later i said where's your husband 
don't listen to the world bank listen to the people on the ground 
our scientist colleagues are finding new patterns in the information 
for artists we're making new worlds that we can uncover and explore 
the white dots are the probability wave that will show you where the electron is in any given point of time and space in this particular three-orbital configuration 
what kind of remarkable machinery does this guy have in his head 
a system of cognitive processes largely non-conscious cognitive processes that help them change their views of the world so that they can feel better about the worlds in which they find themselves 
who are these characters who are so damn happy 
some of you are old enough to remember he was the chairman of the house of representatives and he resigned in disgrace when this young republican named newt gingrich found out about a shady book deal he had done 
so he went to find them they said we can give you a franchise on this for 3000 bucks 
and finally never ever join the beatles  
in this case because the experiment i'm going to tell you about uses them these are monet prints 
we did this experiment with a group of patients who had anterograde amnesia these are hospitalized patients 
we then gave them the choice between number three and number four 
really jim you don't remember i was just here with the monet prints 
free aren't you just giving me my own paper 
what are you doing 
they don't like their picture and in fact even after the opportunity to swap has expired they still don't like their picture why 
we could do it so that when you take the two pictures you'd have four days to change your mind or we're doing another course where you take the two pictures and you make up your mind right away and you can never change it which course would you like to be in 
let me parenthetically pause here and tell you -- esther my mother had stopped driving several years ago to the collective relief of the entire city of atlanta 
there's a historical marker 
i guess i must 
oh jesus 
puts it in reverse fifty-five out of the driveway in reverse 
i've got a white-knuckle grip on the door you know what i'm talking about 
and there she goes right 
ok so i stopped at a light and there's a guy you know in the back 
now you have all been at a mall during the holidays yes 
it will upset you 
look the chevy -- he's coming this way 
how many of you once in your -- you were a kid you were an adult -- you stood in a parking space to hold it for someone 
of course her comeback is when have i embarrassed you 
a brevity brevity of everything with this child 
but she pauses occasionally and says how do you spell that what year ok 
when she writes the expose in about 20 years don't believe a word of it 
but this is my daughter lauren my remarkable daughter my borderline asperger's kid 
she says ma you got to look 
now when this kid says i got to look you know 
oh jesus oh jesus 
i finally come -- and now it's the south 
we want to curl up and say tell it to me tell it to me 
i'm with the little lady damn 
after i say -- let me refresh you -- have you no shame 
with her is a young man -- husband brother lover it's not my job 
they turn then shoulder to shoulder and walk away lost in their own reverie 
and they use motors that literally are used on cruise missile boosters 
voices woohoo yeah nice 
what are catastrophic effects a three degree centigrade climate change rise that will result in 50 percent species extinction 
but now i'll talk about some more pleasant things 
how fabulous why would you ever want to go by yourself in your own car 
where can i go today and who can i do it with 
it's when you charge a premium for people to drive on congested roads 
in london the day they turned the congestion pricing on there was a 25 percent decrease in congestion overnight and that's persisted for the four years in which they've been doing congestion pricing 
you weren't going to put tollbooths around the city of london and open and shut those gates 
and road pricing is where we're all going to have to go because today we pay for our maintenance and wear and tear on our cars with gas taxes 
and if we have it you'll decide how many miles to drive what mode of travel where to live and work 
again all mesh-enabled monthly communication cost zero 
they're resilient their redundancy is built into this fabulous decentralized design 
these things are going to happen 
maybe we shouldn't wait for the 10 or 15 years for this to happen 
and if i had my druthers we would have an open-source version in addition to open standards 
when i went this morning to larry brilliant's tedtalk prize -- his fabulous networks -- imagine if there was an open-source mesh communications device that can be put into those networks to make all that happen 
so the awesome story it begins about 40 years ago when my mom and my dad came to canada 
my dad left a small village outside of amritsar india 
and they got here in the late 1960s 
we grew up taking for granted a lot of the things that my parents couldn't take for granted when they grew up -- things like power always on in our houses things like schools across the street and hospitals down the road and popsicles in the backyard 
so you can't actually see them but it was breathtaking believe me 
my marriage wasn't going well and we just were growing further and further apart 
one day my wife came home from work and summoned the courage through a lot of tears to have a very honest conversation 
and as these dark clouds were circling me and i was finding it really really difficult to think of anything good i said to myself that i really needed a way to focus on the positive somehow 
and nobody read it except for my mom 
flash-forward to the next year and the book of awesome has now been number one on the bestseller list for 20 straight weeks 
but look i said i wanted to do three things with you today 
it's sad and it's not pleasant to talk about but your husband might leave you your girlfriend could cheat your headaches might be more serious than you thought or your dog could get hit by a car on the street 
and there are times in life when you will be tossed in the well too with twists in your stomach and with holes in your heart and when that bad news washes over you and when that pain sponges and soaks in i just really hope you feel like you've always got two choices 
because you all used to be three years old 
that three-year-old girl is still part of you 
these were four guys on the la rams in the 1960s you did not want to go up against 
i'd like to pause my tedtalk for about 10 seconds right now because you don't get many opportunities in life to do something like this and my parents are sitting in the front row 
he would say look can you believe they have a mango here from mexico 
you can sleep in clean sheets 
the cashiers at your grocery store the foreman at your plant the guy tailgating you home on the highway the telemarketer calling you during dinner every teacher you've ever had everyone that's ever woken up beside you every politician in every country every actor in every movie every single person in your family everyone you love everyone in this room and you will be dead in a hundred years 
thank you 
dan rather since the september 11th attack on the world trade center many people have flocked to downtown new york to see and pay respects at what amounts to the 16-acre burial ground 
now as cbs's jim axelrod reports they're putting the finishing touches on a new way for people to visit and view the scene 
there's a new place in new york where the crowds are thickest -- ground zero 
this is ours 
david rockwell the first experience people will have here when they see this is not as a construction site but as this incredibly moving burial ground 
the walls are bare by design so people can fill them with their own memorials the way they already have along the current perimeter 
your work is highly sensual even hedonistic 
but i've got to tell you -- it became impossible to do that 
we were really paralyzed 
and in discussing this with other architects we had seen people saying in the press that they should rebuild the towers as they were -- they should rebuild them 50 stories taller 
it was predominantly a white rich corporate group that was not representative of the city 
and i think this was the 21st and we knew this had to be built and up by the 28th 
in fact it was as if this was going to be window-washing scaffolding 
and i've got to say that we spent a lot of time in putting this together watching the crowds that gathered at saint paul -- which is just to the right -- and moving around the site 
no in fact i told the contractor to go ahead 
i think this is obviously substantially different from anything we'd ever thought about doing before just by the nature of it 
well i think one thing that shouldn't be done is evaluate -- i think right now the discussion is a very closed discussion on the master plan 
i don't think it has much to do with 50 or 60 or 70 or 80 thousand new office spaces regardless of what the number is 
and in fact there's a proposal on the table now for building number seven 
right which the towers fell into 
and the reason that's been held up is essentially by community outrage that they're not re-opening the street to connect that back to the rest of the city 
this small foundation we put together is looking for other ways to help 
so i thought that would be good to end with 
one of the tricky issues we had with the giuliani administration was i had forgotten how anti-graffiti he was 
and essentially our structure was designed to be written on 
as you say it's not a memorial 
but the kind of virtually instantaneous nature of its erection and its being there almost before you could believe that a response of this magnitude could be accomplished is part of its extraordinary -- i don't know if beauty is the word -- but presence 
so a funny thing happened on my way to becoming a brilliant world-class neuropsychologist i had a baby 
sorry ted 
because this is what i do this is what i teach 
so look to the right-hand side of the screen 
would it be crazy to know 103 gs 
how do we know that legislation that would require that they be pulled from play cleared for return to play applies to them 
if god forbid any of us left here tonight and sustained a concussion most of us would go on to fully recover inside of a couple hours to a couple of weeks 
should your kid play football i don't know 
the first study up 
we've just rolled this out in the last couple months -- co kids with brain injury 
now i thought that it was because i have this totally compelling helmet crusade right this epiphany of tom's 
thank you 
this is but one this is frank gehry the architect's precursor to the guggenheim in abu dhabi 
so my first topic with respect to this was not death but obesity 
so this is a slide of some of our initial results 
how big are the clusters how far do they reach 
this here shows on the y-axis the increase in the probability that a person is obese given that a social contact of theirs is obese and on the x-axis the degrees of separation between the two people 
and the next bar over the [red] line says if your friend's friends are obese your risk of obesity is 25 percent higher 
there are at least three possibilities one possibility is that as i gain weight it causes you to gain weight 
another more subtle possibility is that they start gaining weight and it changes your ideas of what an acceptable body size is 
now i want to be very clear we do not think our work should or could justify prejudice against people of one or another body size at all 
and by the end you're going to see clusters of obese and non-obese individuals within the network 
and so this function of emotions suggests that in addition to any other purpose they serve they're a kind of primitive form of communication 
and whether you become happy or not depends in part on whether you occupy a happy patch 
so this work with emotions which are so fundamental then got us to thinking about maybe the fundamental causes of human social networks are somehow encoded in our genes 
well the striking patterns of human social networks their ubiquity and their apparent purpose beg questions about whether we evolved to have human social networks in the first place and whether we evolved to form networks with a particular structure 
and finally compare nodes c and d c and d both have six friends 
but now we with a bird's eye view looking at this network can see that they occupy very different social worlds 
so different structural locations have different implications for your life 
they are a kind of social capital 
new properties emerge because of our embeddedness in social networks and these properties inhere in the structure of the networks not just in the individuals within them 
they're both made of carbon and yet one of them has carbon atoms in it that are arranged in one particular way -- on the left -- and you get graphite which is soft and dark 
if i was always violent towards you or gave you misinformation or made you sad or infected you with deadly germs you would cut the ties to me and the network would disintegrate 
i'd never seen anything like that 
but after seeing what i've seen the truth is they have not disappeared at all 
and this is happening every day 
and from these bedrooms and living rooms and garages with cheap webcams lies the world's great dancers of tomorrow 
and you let it go and then right when you see the tail you grab it by the tail then you bring it back in 
you know you create power then you tame it 
according to the treaty those lands are a sovereign nation 
1868 the second fort laramie treaty clearly guarantees the sovereignty of the great sioux nation and the lakotas' ownership of the sacred black hills 
a new agreement was presented to sioux chiefs and their leading men under a campaign known as sell or starve sign the paper or no food for your tribe 
reservations are cut up into 160-acre sections and distributed to individual indians with the surplus disposed of 
tribes lost millions of acres 
to this day this is the most medals of honor ever awarded for a single battle 
unemployment on the pine ridge indian reservation fluctuates between 85 and 90 percent 
this is how we came to own these united states 
and how much of this history do you need to own even 
because the solution seems so far in the past i needed nothing short of a time machine to access them 
that's why there's a glass of water up there 
this solution has been called by some potentially the most important medical advance this century 
and what it was was oral rehydration salts 
maybe there's a biological answer 
see we spent a lot of energy in many domains -- technological scientific hard work creativity human ingenuity -- to crack important social problems with technology solutions 
here i have a bunch of other examples all suffer from the last mile problem 
the last mile is everywhere problematic 
the problem is this little three-pound machine that's behind your eyes and between your ears 
they do lots of inconsistent things 
now diarrhea's interesting because it's been around for thousands of years ever since humankind really lived side by side enough to have really polluted water 
so think of the mental model that goes behind reducing the intake 
so here you all are ostensibly educated people 
most of you look smart 
i think we've learned the answer to that here 
almost out of kindergarten 
these models like the leaky bucket work well in most situations 
they are situations where the mental model doesn't match the reality 
so now while you're thinking about that let's move to a second task 
fifty versus 35 that's a big move eleven versus nine come on 
so far i've been pretty negative 
you just gotta carry this thing around 
here's another example of this 
this is from a company called positive energy 
and what they find is just this letter nothing else has a two to three percent reduction in electricity use 
we have testing we go to the lab we try it again we have refinement 
so this whole area is so fascinating 
how you take your insights here and actually get them integrated into working business models on the ground in indian villages for example 
we work closely with companies that have operational capacity or nonprofits that have operational capacity 
if you have biological problems we try and fix it see if it works and then work the scale 
when the magazine -- actually when i got the subscription -- it was 12 following pages 
if it's -- see it for a long enough time i actually do something about it 
thank you so much 
well now if i take that sugar dough the sugar dough doesn't want to conduct electricity 
we call this our sushi circuit it's very popular with kids 
i plug in again the power to it 
i can start plugging in lots of lights 
we've got some videos you can make them yourselves 
we've had a mom in utah who used them with her kids to a science researcher in the uk and curriculum developers in hawaii 
up don't move the wrist over the heart don't move the wrist 
and then look at me 
good nice and you can sit over there 
which one shall have a good poker hand 
this guy beats them with four of a kind or deuce -- deuce 
no reaction that with even -- ok and this 
these look in order i'm probably -- hopefully -- yeah three four five six seven and  
such life right 
now if you are interested i will demonstrate some underground techniques 
right you agree 
ok 
so -- because if you look now i can still see it 
come to -- no no no no 
when i'm sober i do this much quicker but we will check 
pardon but then when we will have it back you do this 
perfect 
please name any card anyone 
my fault don't applaud this was clubs 
but now i do it the regular speed right 
excellent 
and queen of hearts yes 
so now a false count 
right sorry my -- i should have mentioned that yeah 
yeah good 
i liked it now a little more difficult 
you see i don't work with prestige so always do mistakes 
one two three four -- yes the camera got it five six seven eight -- ah -- nine 10 the jack jack of spades queen of -- i like that laugh yeah good queen 
there was the place and here is king of spades correct 
ah this is tough 
maybe it's important -- yeah -- nine of diamonds ok 
and i give you a diamonds so they -- so you put them here in a nice row right and you can see yeah good 
you're peeking you just got to -- this is a request from the lady in the back 
we will try 
and there are some of us who think you ain't seen nothing yet 
i see some of you recognize this child 
at that point they usually give up 
and the 10-year-old on every eight notes 
it can be the other buttock 
these are the people who never listen to classical music 
you couldn't tell the difference between somebody from texas and somebody from rome 
of course i'm not sure they'll be up to it 
do you know what i think probably happened in this room 
and for the rest of your life every time you hear classical music you'll always be able to know if you hear those impulses 
do you remember hamlet act one scene three he finds out that his uncle killed his father 
no otherwise the play would be over stupid 
now he tries the e again that chord doesn't work 
and i've one last request before i play this piece all the way through 
and i did exactly what i did with you and i told them and explained them and the whole thing 
now how would you walk -- because you know my profession the music profession doesn't see it that way 
people in my orchestra came up to me and said ben what happened that's what happened 
who am i being that my children's eyes are not shining 
i learned this from a woman who survived auschwitz one of the rare survivors 
and she told me this she said we were in the train going to auschwitz and i looked down and saw my brother's shoes were missing 
thank you 
here's what he did he gathered his participants 
if you're the fastest of everyone we're testing here today you get 20 dollars 
but for a lot of tasks they actually either don't work or often they do harm 
if you look at the science there is a mismatch between what science knows and what business does 
but for 21st century tasks that mechanistic reward-and-punishment approach doesn't work often doesn't work and often does harm 
same deal you we're timing for norms 
low-cost providers around the world can do it cheaper 
the rules are mystifying 
okay but one the task called for even rudimentary cognitive skill a larger reward led to poorer performance 
people offered the medium level of rewards did no better than people offered the small rewards 
in eight of the nine tasks we examined across three experiments higher incentives led to worse performance 
last month just last month economists at lse looked at 51 studies of pay-for-performance plans inside of companies 
there is a mismatch between what science knows and what business does 
purpose the yearning to do what we do in the service of something larger than ourselves 
traditional notions of management are great if you want compliance 
a few times a year they tell their engineers go for the next 24 hours and work on anything you want as long as it's not part of your regular job 
and then being australians everybody has a beer 
that one day of intense autonomy has produced a whole array of software fixes that might never have existed 
they have autonomy over their time their task their team their technique 
autonomy mastery and purpose versus carrot and sticks and who wins 
three the secret to high performance isn't rewards and punishments but that unseen intrinsic drive -- the drive to do things for their own sake 
so this again is on the subject -- a slice from the equator of the earth 
it turns once per day in synchrony with the earth 
this would be grown i suppose with nanotechnology in the future sometime 
so if we could roll the next film here 
this has evolved over the years in a lot of different iterations 
the idea of this air genie is it's something that can just transform and become anything 
and then it would have a corresponding website that would show the itinerary of this 
um he was happy 
let's see somebody else a great conductor 
he's a nice guy he's a really nice guy 
it's not true when he was a young man of about 30 he wrote what he called the ten commandments for conductors 
the first one was if you sweat by the end of the concert it means that you must have done something wrong 
now either he is senile and doesn't remember his own music because he wrote the music 
so no he doesn't want that that's a different kind of control 
once like a muti and you'll --  -- clap just once 
and then like karajan let's see what happens okay 
and when karajan is asked about it he actually says yes the worst damage i can do to my orchestra is to give them a clear instruction 
well it is different but isn't that controlling in the same way 
look at the eyes 
and you're playing a painful sound 
now it's a reversed thing you're telling the story and you're telling the story 
but all my work for many years was focused around the idea that sustainability means basically looking at the globalized economic growth model and moderating what comes in at one end and moderating the outputs at the other end 
if you could help me with that it would be fantastic 
it's open source it's something which everybody who's involved with it develops and passes on as they work with it 
it's self-organizing there is no great central organization that pushes this people just pick up an idea and they run with it and they implement it where they are 
and it's really about how systems settlements withstand shock from the outside 
when our supermarkets have only two or three days' worth of food in them at any one time often sustainability tends to focus on the energy efficiency of the freezers and on the packaging that the lettuces are wrapped up in 
it's a process which is playful and creative and informative 
and there are thousands of others who are at what we call the mulling stage 
a lot of places are working with their local schools 
and also starting to play around with the idea of alternative currencies 
and we see it all over the place as well now 
this is probably the most boring topic of the whole morning 
many of the people involved have special interests or short-term interests that get them not thinking about what the implications of the trends are 
now how did we get here 
they make you pay more in withholding just to help their cash flow out 
and california's not unique 
there's ways if it's temporary to minimize the impact but it's a problem 
well you have to allocate dollars for that system and for that incentive pay 
well there really is no brain trust 
so what do we need to do 
whenever they say there's these long-term problems we can't say oh you're the messenger with bad news 
now i think this is a solvable problem 
what do i know that would cause me a reticent midwestern scientist to get myself arrested in front of the white house protesting 
did it mean that venus had an ionosphere 
and it was kept hot by a thick carbon dioxide atmosphere 
its changes will affect all of humanity 
british physicist john tyndall in the 1850's made laboratory measurements of the infrared radiation which is heat 
most of the things mentioned in our 1981 paper were facts 
i had the privilege to speak twice to the president's climate task force 
let me describe the most important conclusion from the physics -- first from earth's energy balance and second from earth's climate history 
now finally we can measure earth's energy imbalance precisely by measuring the heat content in earth's heat reservoirs 
the biggest reservoir the ocean was the least well measured until more than 3000 argo floats were distributed around the world's ocean 
yet there was more energy coming in than going out 
these curves for global temperature atmospheric co2 and sea level were derived from ocean cores and antarctic ice cores from ocean sediments and snowflakes that piled up year after year over 800000 years forming a two-mile thick ice sheet 
and more co2 causes more warming 
so co2 methane and ice sheets were feedbacks that amplified global temperature change causing these ancient climate oscillations to be huge even though the climate change was initiated by a very weak forcing 
and the rate has accelerated since the measurements began nine years ago 
ice sheets would continue to disintegrate for centuries 
what may be more reprehensible if climate denial continues is extermination of species 
an important impact if global warming continues will be on the breadbasket of our nation and the world the midwest and great plains which are expected to become prone to extreme droughts worse than the dust bowl within just a few decades if we let global warming continue 
i need your help to communicate the gravity and the urgency of this situation and its solutions more effectively 
a parachute jump from the very edge of space 
what i'd like to do first is take you through a very brief helicopter ride of stunts and the stunts industry in the movies and in television and show you how technology has started to interface with the physical skills of the stunt performer in a way that makes the stunts bigger and actually makes them safer than they've ever been before 
i'm a stunt coordinator and as well as perform stunts i often design them 
what safety they had was very scant 
this is the first stunt woman rosie venger an amazing woman 
yakima canutt really formed the stunt fight 
talking of dangerous stunts and bringing things slightly up to date some of the most dangerous stunts we do as stunt people are fire stunts 
well we used to use trampettes in the old days that's all they had 
and that's a ramp spring off the thing and fly through the air and hopefully you make it look good 
now we've got technology this thing is called an air ram 
rolling a car over is another area where we use technology 
that's a long way to fall if you get it wrong that was just about right 
this is a shot of terminator the movie 
it's 30 feet it's water it's very simple 
this guy is not skydiving he's being flown like a kite or moved around like a kite 
it's that shape because the helium has to expand 
certainly at 100000 feet no aircraft will fly 
we will have two balloons for each of my test jumps and two balloons for the main jump because they notoriously tear on takeoff 
a drogue chute is just a smaller chute which helps to keep your face down 
it's hundreds of feet high it's enormous 
it's a three sided box basically 
that's the prototype of the parachute i've now had them custom make one the only one of its kind in the world and that's the only suit of its kind in the world 
then they're comfortable they have good vision like this great big visor 
and then if the cabin depressurizes while the aircraft is coming back down in whatever emergency measures everyone is okay 
but if you are and you say to somebody you know they say what do you do 
like religion and money and other things 
what you have there is a person of extraordinary dedication who found a talent and my contention is all kids have tremendous talents 
thank you very much  so 15 minutes left 
and the girl said i'm drawing a picture of god 
he was in the nativity play 
you may have seen it nativity ii but james got the part of joseph which we were thrilled about 
we had the place crammed full of agents in t-shirts james robinson is joseph  
anyway the three boys came in -- four-year-olds with tea towels on their heads -- and they put these boxes down and the first boy said i bring you gold 
and the third boy said frank sent this  
they have become frightened of being wrong 
so why is this 
you don't think of shakespeare having a father do you 
shakespeare being seven i never thought of it i mean he was seven at some point he was in somebody's english class wasn't he how annoying would that be 
and stop speaking like that it's confusing everybody 
art and music are normally given a higher status in schools than drama and dance there isn't an education system on the planet that teaches dance everyday to children the way we teach them mathematics why 
we all have bodies don't we did i miss a meeting 
and i like university professors but you know we shouldn't hold them up as the high-water mark of all human achievement 
benign advice -- now profoundly mistaken the whole world is engulfed in a revolution 
secondly intelligence is dynamic 
it's really prompted by a conversation i had with a wonderful woman who maybe most people have never heard of she's called gillian lynne -- have you heard of her some have she's a choreographer and everybody knows her work 
i grew up at a time when iconic actors from kuwait syria egypt used laughter to unite the region just as football can 
also three guys working for years in los angeles an iranian a palestinian and an egyptian created the aptly named axis of evil comedy act 
who had started a successful new tribe 
i invited our new ceo and as soon as he realized we had a room packed full of laughing infidels his reaction was very simple let's make this happen 
stay away from bolitics in the middle east 
now were the axis successful 
anywhere you go 
we're not all angry fanatics who want to kill the infidel 
for inspiration go to one of our festivals go online drop us a line 
as my father likes to call him asheikh azubare as my mother would say shakespeare 
and i'm not a trained academic 
it was very difficult not to get scared not to get daunted 
we want to take one child at a time and take the child right through school sent to college and get them prepared for better living a high value job 
that was our first school one hundred sixty-five children 
but they know there is this myth that children from the slums cannot speak english well 
even if it takes me four and a half hours or three and half hours to finish my book i do it 
we have to send the fathers to de-addiction labs and when they come back most times sober we have to find a job for them so that they don't regress 
art music are considered therapy and mediums of expression 
we didn't hire mckinsey to do a business plan 
he comes for a tummy rub because he believes that will give me luck  
i promise you parusharam will speak in the ted conference a few years from now 
i think i was supposed to talk about my new book which is called blink and it's about snap judgments and first impressions 
so i decided instead i would talk about someone who i think has done as much to make americans happy as perhaps anyone over the last 20 years a man who is a great personal hero of mine someone by the name of howard moskowitz who is most famous for reinventing spaghetti sauce 
and one of his first clients was -- this is many years ago back in the early '70s -- one of his first clients was pepsi 
we'd like you to figure out how much aspartame we should put in each can of diet pepsi in order to have the perfect drink right 
and he would think it through and say what was wrong 
why could we not make sense of this experiment with diet pepsi 
this was his horseradish  he was obsessed with it 
you'd have a plate of spaghetti and you would pour it on right 
and of those three facts the third one was the most significant because at the time in the early 1980s if you went to a supermarket you would not find extra-chunky spaghetti sauce 
and prego turned to howard and they said you telling me that one third of americans crave extra-chunky spaghetti sauce and yet no one is servicing their needs and he said yes 
it's a mystery 
what percentage of you actually like a dark rich hearty roast 
a mustard of more sophistication and culture and meaning 
there is no perfect mustard or imperfect mustard 
and where did that come from it came from italy 
when we talked about authentic tomato sauce in the 1970s we talked about italian tomato sauce we talked about the earliest ragus which had no visible solids right 
because we thought that what it took to make people happy was to provide them with the most culturally authentic tomato sauce a and b we thought that if we gave them the culturally authentic tomato sauce then they would embrace it 
i guess my cancer different from your cancer 
and for that we owe him a great vote of thanks 
and the example he used was coffee 
but to us he was just dad and our home life was pretty normal 
and i think a lot of people in his day probably thought he was a bit of a kook 
or even the people who actually pulled it off the people at bolt beranek and newman in boston who just would sketch out these structures of what would eventually become a worldwide network and sketching things on the back of napkins and on note papers and arguing over dinner at howard johnson's -- on route 128 in lexington massachusetts just two miles from where i was studying the queen's gambit deferred and listening to gladys knight &amp the pips singing midnight train to georgia while --  -- in my dad's big easy chair you know 
another one which believes in the pure transparency of content 
these are four very different ways of looking at the world i even gave them names 
and there's also a balance between the visible and the invisible in comics 
this was even before the web 
and so what they would do is they'd have these comic pages that resemble print comics pages and they would introduce all this sound and motion 
the distance from abraham lincoln to a lincoln penny the penny marshall to the marshall plan to plan 9 to nine lives it's all the same 
so i had all these notions this was back in the late '90s and other people in my business thought i was pretty crazy but a lot of people then went on and actually did it 
i just want to get to the last panel 
talk about your infinite canvas 
why is this important 
but media provides us with a window back into the world that we live in 
thank you for having me 
♫ strung in the wind i called you ♫ ♫ but you did not hear  ♫ ♫ and you're a plant that needs poor soil ♫ ♫ and i have treated you too well ♫ ♫ to give up flowers  ♫ ♫ oh i have been too rich for you  ♫ ♫ farther than the sun from me ♫ ♫ farther than i'd have you be ♫ ♫ and i go north i get so cold ♫ ♫ my heart is lava under stone ♫ ♫ you are not worthy ♫ ♫ you are not worthy  ♫ ♫ with your calculating eyes ♫ ♫ spinning figures ♫ ♫ you cannot see me ♫ ♫ you cannot see me  ♫ ♫ and if i tell myself enough ♫ ♫ i'll believe it ♫ ♫ you are not worthy ♫ ♫ the sea it freezes over  ♫ ♫ to trap the light ♫ ♫ and i'm in love with being in love ♫ ♫ and you were never quite the one ♫ ♫ in gerda's eyes ♫ ♫ fragments of what you've become ♫ ♫ and all the moths that fly at night ♫ ♫ believe electric light is bright ♫ ♫ you are not worthy ♫ ♫ you are not worthy ♫ ♫ with your calculating eyes ♫ ♫ spinning figures ♫ ♫ you cannot see me no ♫ ♫ and if i tell myself enough ♫ ♫ i'll believe it ♫ ♫ you are not worthy ♫ ♫ farther than the sun from me ♫ ♫ farther than i'd have you be ♫ ♫ and i go north i get so cold ♫ ♫ my heart is lava under stone ♫ ♫ you are not worthy ♫ ♫ you are not worthy ♫ ♫ with your calculating eyes ♫ ♫ spinning figures ♫ ♫ you cannot see me no  ♫ ♫ and if i tell myself enough i'll believe it ♫  thank you very much 
and as great as these books were you could always tell that you were getting close to the full effect 
and that's when i discovered comedy 
it takes the base metal of our conventional wisdom and transforms it through ridicule into a different way of seeing and ultimately being in the world 
because that's what i take from the theme of this conference gained in translation 
now i'm big on speaking to people's self-interest because we're all wired for that 
now that's honesty and integrity and it's also why fey's performances left such a lasting impression 
now whether this says more about the conflict between integrity and profitability of corporate journalism than it does about the attentiveness of stewart's viewers the larger point remains that stewart's material is always grounded in a commitment to the facts -- not because his intent is to inform it's not 
his intent is to be funny 
and just like that you've been seduced into a different way of looking at something because the endorphins have brought down your defenses 
because from what i can tell the three things gay americans seem to want most are to join the military get married and start a family 
economy of language is another real strong suit of great comedy 
how about that how about we create a better world for nothing 
and not long after that he got another request for a copy from the head of the epa in california who used it as part of her presentation at an international conference on climate change in sacramento last year 
and i think that if you're not there's probably something inherently wrong with the structure or the situation you're in if you're a designer 
being serious is hard 
serious design serious play is something else 
now i always saw design careers like surreal staircases 
and as you get older and more decrepit you sort of inch along on this sort of depressing long staircase leading you into oblivion 
there's a paul newman movie that i love called the verdict 
this is the case there are no other cases 
and that is a wonderful position to be in to create some serious play 
there was no format 
i lived and breathed it in a way i haven't with a client since 
it enabled me to really express myself and grow 
but something happened to it and what happened to it was it became very popular 
here's an ad in the new york times somebody did for a play called mind games 
i'd never done this kind of work before 
this is symphony space on 90th street and broadway and the type is interwoven into the stainless steel and backlit with fiber optics 
and it was serious play 
they got into it -- they took the job incredibly seriously 
but it became the end of the seriousness of the play and it started to once again become solemn 
and then i spent a year going to long tedious boring meetings trying to sell this logo through to a huge corporation to the point of tears 
here's the united states 
and there are some brilliant linguists mostly russians who are working on that at santa fe institute and in moscow and i would love to see where that leads 
you may just know more about everything than anyone 
it was a big idea for sure and it was one that he felt could truly inform and deeply affect the decision making of this body through animations of global data trends and other information regarding the globe on this sphere 
we can use leds 
in addition to higher resolution versions of this display my father and i are working on a new patent-pending design for a fully volumetric display using the same phenomenon 
and so you could see that as this disc rotates about this axis it will create a disc of light that we can control 
that's nothing new that's a propeller clock that's the rims that you can buy for your car 
now as we continue to tinker with the oceans more and more reports are predicting that the kinds of seas that we're creating will be conducive to low-energy type of animals like jellyfish and bacteria 
and this is this voracious predator launching a sneak attack on this poor little unsuspecting jellyfish there a by-the-wind sailor 
it reaches up to almost 5000 pounds -- on a diet of jellyfish primarily 
they like to sunbathe can't blame them 
you know you look at sharks and they're streamlined and they're sleek and you look at tuna and they're like torpedoes -- they just give away their agenda they're about migration and strength and then you look at the sunfish 
and this is just so elegantly mysterious it's just -- it really kind of holds its cards a lot tighter than say a tuna 
and from that little egg they pass through this spiky little porcupine fish stage reminiscent of their ancestry and develop -- this is their little adolescent stage 
that's a little diver up there in the corner 
how do you do that with an animal -- very few places in the world 
and it's pictured right here that little tag up there 
but they have 40 genera of parasites and so we figured just one more parasite won't be too much of a problem 
so what are we trying to find out we're focusing on the pacific 
we're tagging on the california coast and we're tagging over in taiwan and japan 
not this time of year -- it's more around october 
and i'm not exaggerating it is just -- and sometimes they don't eat them it's just spiteful 
and they'll put their fins out and their eyes go in the back of their head and the fish come up and they just clean clean clean -- because the molas you know there's just a smorgasbord of parasites 
i'm going to show you our latest dataset 
and we found that they kind of are homebodies 
so that's a very important piece of data 
but also what's important is that they're not slacker lazy fish 
i set up a website because i was getting so many questions about molas and sunfish 
i was getting reports from catholic nuns jewish rabbis muslims christians -- everybody writing in united by their love of life 
one day a one-eyed monkey came into the forest 
under a tree she saw a woman meditating furiously 
she was the wife of an even more famous brahmin 
in india only 25 percent of rapes come to a police station and of these 25 percent that come to a police station convictions are only in four percent of the cases 
because nobody can get a kickback 
man and you you count that she does it right  
woman here father your eight-times folded cotton sari 
it's that little gene it's small and it's mean 
cause you're either a victim or on top like me 
goodbye martin luther king 
there are more people dying of simple things 
but the princess continued whistling 
soon the palace filled with princes whistling 
now what shall we do said the queen 
the other sort of genesis of what von neumann did was the difficulty of how you would predict the weather 
rca started this whole thing off and said you know televisions are the future not computers 
that's where i grew up as a kid 
all these forces came together there in princeton 
they didn't fit in at the institute 
and what they did at the institute was publish every step of the way 
all the computers now are copies of that machine 
what's code what's hardware 
damn it i can be just as stubborn as this thing 
everything up to this point is wasted time what's the use good night 
so they really were working under tough conditions 
machine run fine code isn't 
and sometimes things are okay 
he's still ahead of some of the stuff that's being done now 
and he found all these sort of -- it was like a naturalist coming in and looking at this tiny 5000-byte universe and seeing all these things happening that we see in the outside world in biology 
and they did start to evolve 
and it's julian bigelow who was running it until midnight when the machine was officially turned off 
aunties uncles you can continue to put your hands up aunties and uncles as well 
we the adults of the last four generations have blessed our children with the destiny of a shorter lifespan than their own parents 
you lot you're all right but we'll get you eventually don't worry 
we spend our lives being paranoid about death murder homicide you name it it's on the front page of every paper cnn 
think about smoking 
and let's be honest guys you ain't got that cash 
but you know what her father who was obese died in her arms and then the second most important man in her life her uncle died of obesity and now her step-dad is obese 
and he's fed up with it he's fed up with burying his friends his family his community 
can't even get them out the door -- and i'm being serious -- can't even get them there forklift 
they want to be self -- they want to self-police themselves 
normal let's get on schools something that i'm fairly much a specialist in 
what is school who invented it what's the purpose of school 
so you could say that school food is quite important really judging the circumstances 
the system is highly run by accountants there's not enough or any food-knowledgeable people in the business 
we don't teach kids about food right 
and this is a little clip from an elementary school which is very common in england 
i want to tell you about something i want to tell you about something that kind of epitomizes the trouble that we're in guys ok 
i want to talk about something so basic as milk 
because someone at the milk board right -- and don't get me wrong i support milk -- but someone at the milk board probably paid a lot of money for some geezer to work out that if you put loads of flavorings and colorings and sugar in milk right more kids will drink it yeah 
it's in everything even the milk hasn't escaped the kind of modern-day problems 
there's our milk there's our carton 
and i've taken the liberty of putting in just the five years of elementary school sugar just from milk 
now if i came up here and i wish i could come up here today and hang a cure for aids or cancer you'd be fighting and scrambling to get to me 
to reboot and make real tangible change real change so that i could look you in the white of the eyes and say in 10 years time the history of your children's lives happiness -- and let's not forget you're clever if you eat well you know you're going to live longer -- all of that stuff it will look different ok 
now also back to the sort of big brands labeling i said earlier is an absolute farce and has got to be sorted 
the workplace we haven't really talked about it 
you know it's local cooks teaching local people 
around america if we just look back now there is plenty of wonderful things going on 
when i was in huntington trying to get a few things to work when they weren't i thought if i had a magic wand what would i do and i thought you know what 
i'd just love to be put in front of some of the most amazing movers and shakers in america 
we are anonymous we are legion 
we are but the base of chaos 
and they're pretty scary 
you never know when they're going to attack next who or what the consequences will be 
there's a strong whiff of half-baked anarchism about them 
but one thing is true we are at the beginning of a mighty struggle for control of the internet 
now this is a very complicated struggle 
instead we prefer these really dazzling technological solutions which cost a huge amount of money 
but because they're a un operation maybe that's why governments and corporations are not that interested in them 
because it's a un operation of course it lacks funding 
cybercriminals would go there to buy and sell stolen credit card details to exchange information about new malware that was out there 
the purchaser would send the administrative officer some dollars digitally and the vendor would sell the stolen credit card details 
now i spoke to one of these carders who we'll call redbrigade -- although that wasn't even his proper nickname -- but i promised i wouldn't reveal who he was 
and this man with a planetary-sized brain is now serving a 13-year sentence in california 
and he has done path-breaking work on autism and confirmed also for the authorities here that gary mckinnon -- who is wanted by the united states for hacking into the pentagon -- suffers from asperger's and a secondary condition of depression 
how would someone get over that kind of fear that the hacker they hire might preserve that little teensy wormhole 
i think to an extent you have to understand that it's axiomatic among hackers that they do that 
has about one-third the carbon footprint of the average suburban dweller mostly because suburbanites drive a lot more and living in detached buildings you have that much more exterior surface to leak energy out of 
whether you love suburbia's leafy privacy or you hate its soulless commercial strips there are reasons why it's important to retrofit 
but is it practical 
june williamson and i have been researching this topic for over a decade and we've found over 80 varied projects 
that basically the boomers want to be able to age in place and gen y would like to live an urban lifestyle but most of their jobs will continue to be out in suburbia 
other malls have been re-inhabited as nursing homes as universities and as all variety of office space 
we also found a lot of examples of dead big-box stores that have been converted into all sorts of community-serving uses as well -- lots of schools lots of churches and lots of libraries like this one 
this one is a little l-shaped strip shopping center in phoenix arizona 
really all they did was they gave it a fresh coat of bright paint a gourmet grocery and they put up a restaurant in the old post office 
sometimes it's all at once 
when metrorail expanded transit into the suburbs and opened a station nearby to this site the owners decided to build a new parking deck and then insert on top of their surface lots a new main street several apartments and condo buildings while keeping the existing office buildings 
so here's what it looks like 
you can sort of see the funky new condo buildings in between the office buildings and the public space and the new main street 
i think they really built an attractive place here and have just employed all-green construction 
but it's also not really enough to just create pockets of walkability 
so this is one that has been retrofitted in california 
so there's a lot of great things but i'd love to see more corridors getting retrofitting 
sometimes re-greening is really the better answer 
there's also a burgeoning suburban farming movement -- sort of victory gardens meets the internet 
now retrofits are often accused of being examples of faux downtowns and instant urbanism and not without reason you don't get much more phony than an astroturf town green 
i have to say these are very hybrid places 
or maybe it's because when i was a teenager back in the '50s my uncle henry -- having denounced the ku klux klan and been bombed for his trouble and had crosses burned in his yard living under death threat -- took his wife and children to massachusetts for safety and went back to south carolina to face down the klan alone 
never mind the fact that they were slow to acknowledge they needed saving 
i labored in that vineyard for a quarter century before making my way to a little kingdom of the just in upstate south carolina a methodist-affiliated institution of higher learning called wofford college 
and there mr teszler began all over again and once again achieved immense success especially after he invented the process for manufacturing a new fabric called double-knit 
he got the same answer you bring the best workers that you can find and if they are good enough i will hire them 
do you have any other questions 
and into the slow second movement marked adagio religioso he incorporated the sounds of birdsong that he heard outside his window in what he knew would be his last spring he was imagining a future for her in which he would play no part 
this defines the imagined futures of our fellow hungarians -- robicsek teszler and bartok -- as it does my own 
this is our task we know it will be hard 
women go days weeks months without looking at it 
you're twisting your head up arching your back it's exhausting 
ok at first women were a little shy a little reluctant to talk 
once they got going you couldn't stop them 
vagina vagina vagina it doesn't matter how many times you say the word it never sounds like a word you want to say 
i don't know that that would have been my life ambition 
but i want to talk a little bit about happiness and the relationship to this whole vagina journey because it has been an extraordinary journey that began eight years ago 
one woman took that energy and she said i want to bring this wave this energy to college campuses and so she took the play and she said let's use the play and have performances of the play once a year where we can raise money to stop violence against women in local communities all around the world 
and this is a very heady place 
it's a body world and the species really exists in the body and i think there's a real significance in us attaching our bodies to our heads -- that that separation has created a divide that is often separating purpose from intent 
when we met her three years ago we said what could v-day do for you 
now mr alligator never did come but the idea of mr alligator coming actually saved my sanity and made it ok for me to keep going because i believed in the distance there would be someone coming to rescue me 
they're like the mercedes-benz of the rift valley 
and he'd show up obviously in a form that it took me a long time to understand which is that when we give in the world what we want the most we heal the broken part inside each of us 
we can reconcile 
we can do everything 
my mother died in [a] gynecology complication so i decided to become a gynecology specialist 
maybe i should become an historian or maybe a reporter 
she graduated in russia also 
i succeeded in my place 
that's the best part 
our country has two exploration programs 
we learned of marshall kay's geosynclinal cycle which is a bunch of crap 
mostly discoveries made by accident 
i believe in just enriching the economy 
alvin and sea cliff and cyana and all the major deep submersibles we have which are about eight 
the mid-ocean ridge runs around like the seam on a baseball 
this is on a mercator projection 
but if you were to put it on an equal area projection you'd see that the mid-ocean ridge covers 23 percent of the earth's total surface area 
this is what a real one looks like on the juan de fuca ridge 
but more importantly they discovered edifices down there that they did not understand 
we found the bismarck in 16000 feet we then found the yorktown 
and we stole recently a ship from the united states navy 
it comes online this summer and it begins its journey of exploration 
we have no idea what we're going to discover 
and when you get a jaw drop you can inform 
this i hope will be a future engineer or a future scientist in the battle for truth 
you must get them custom made -- special humongous guitars 
i thought narcissism meant you loved yourself 
but i want to though explain how i came to design my own particular brand of comedy because i've been through so many different forms of it 
i started with improvisation in a particular form of improvisation called theater games which had one rule which i always thought was a great rule for an ethic for a society 
but only two percent don't know the effect that the debacle in argentina will have on the imf's monetary policy --  seems a contradiction 
so this subject-object thing is part of something i'm very interested in because this is why frankly i believe in political correctness 
maybe too far but you know -- i don't think that a person of color making fun of white people is the same thing as a white person making fun of people of color 
there always had to be the butt of a joke 
and then coming to this conference i realized that most everybody here shared those same qualities because really what trickster is is an agent of change 
i hope that's my agent because you aren't paying me anything 
and he said that i had to show more respect because it took up to 18 years to learn how to do mime properly 
huh huh what can't hear you 
but here's how i think i like to make change and that is in making connections 
and didn't that feel good 
and now we're being penetrated 
i still have a way to go 
and what i hope to do when i make these connections is short circuit people's thinking 
i like to think of what i do as a probability wave 
and thank you for inviting me into it 
can we run that andrew 
i would propose therefore that if we took 10 billion dollars from that 213 trillion dollar budget -- which is two one hundredths of that budget -- and we doled out a billion dollars to each one of these problems i'm going to talk to you about the vast majority could be solved and the rest we could deal with so i hope you find this both fascinating -- i'm fascinated by this kind of stuff i gotta admit -- to me these are richard's cockroaches 
we live in an incredible age of modern medicine 
we are all much healthier than we were 20 years ago 
soon genetic breakthroughs and even better medicine are going to allow us to think of 100 as a normal lifespan 
we don't really have mental health insurance in this country and it's --  -- it's really a crime 
so what are the solutions to this  
thank god you can all read 
many other ecosystems on earth are in real real danger 
they expect them to evaporate  
this stuff was supposed to only be feed for animals in the united states and it got into the human food supply and somebody should've figured out that it would get in the human food supply very easily 
this brings back a skepticism that has gone away recently that superweeds and superpests could spread around the world from biotechnology that literally could destroy the world's food supply in very short order 
believe it or not this happens every few hundred thousand years and has happened many times in our history 
but what happens as this occurs is that we lose our magnetic field around the earth over the period of about 100 years and that means that all these cosmic rays and particles that are to come streaming at us from the sun that this field protects us from are -- well basically we're gonna fry  
so maybe we're in the throes of it 
there's a flip side to it in studying stars like our sun we've found that they go through periods of diminishment when their total amount of energy that's expelled from them goes down by maybe one percent 
we've all learned what -- the kind of panic that can occur when an old disease rears its head like anthrax 
again we gotta think about being a colonizing race 
that's a mistake that could literally cost us our future 
and he scans across the ocean and he looks at the sky 
now i don't expect all of you to see all the details here but what i want you to see is this is about 10 percent of the processes that operate within the oceans almost continuously and have for the last 4 billion years 
this is very very important because this is the system this is the crucible out of which life on the planet came and it's now time for us to understand it 
all right let's talk about another perspective on the importance of the oceans 
seconds after this video was taken people in beijing people in sydney people in amsterdam people in washington dc were watching this 
i won't talk a lot about most of them right here but the one on the west coast that's in the box is called the regional scale nodes 
this is going to be much more powerful than having a single ship in a single location then move to a new location 
robotics systems are just incredible these days absolutely incredible 
what are the troops the troops are the autonomous vehicles of course 
they eject it to the surface where it floats and it is picked up by an autonomous airplane and it's brought back to the laboratory within 24 hours of the eruption 
a laboratory many of you heard what happened on 9/7 
we could do work on the sea floor that would be stunning and it would be on live tv if we have interesting things to show 
so we can bring an entirely new telepresence to the world throughout the ocean 
it's going to be amazing 
he won the nobel prize for literature in 1948 
but it is a story of effort and struggle against improbabilities 
these are the dimensions that i like to work with 
it's something very personal 
it's not perhaps the dimensions appreciated by art critics or architecture critics or city planners 
and today we have a kind of evangelical pessimism all around us 
i have never been a fan of the neutral 
expressive spaces are not spaces that simply confirm what we already know 
life is not just an anesthetic to make us smile but to reach out across the abyss of history to places we have never been and would have perhaps been had we not been so lucky 
radical what does it mean it's something which is rooted and something which is rooted deep in a tradition 
it's not something that has a good ending or a bad ending 
therefore i believe it should not be cool 
listening to all of you the complexity of thought the complexity of layers of meaning is overwhelming 
the political is not an enemy of architecture 
so the unexpected is always unexpected 
so not the habitual architecture that instills in us the false sort of stability but an architecture that is full of tension an architecture that goes beyond itself to reach a human soul and a human heart and that breaks out of the shackles of habits 
what is raw the raw i would say is the naked experience untouched by luxury untouched by expensive materials untouched by the kind of refinement that we associate with high culture 
so that is indeed what is memory 
and it's not only our memory but those who remember us which means that architecture is not mute 
you know it costs a lot of money and so on but yes it should not play it safe 
it's about carving out a space for trees 
and yet in all its messiness in all its difficulties i would not have liked somebody to say this is the tabula rasa mister architect -- do whatever you want 
and it is about the dirty word compromise compromise is not bad 
it's difficult 2011 2013 freedom tower the memorial 
daniel libeskind look we have to cure ourselves of the notion that we are authoritarian that we can determine everything that happens 
namibia has got 21 million people but it is only twice the size of california 
most people that are following the story of angelina jolie and brad pitt will know where namibia is 
you might wonder why are you wearing these western clothes 
boy if you are looking after our livestock and you see a cheetah eating our goat -- cheetah is very nervous -- just walk up to it 
but then he said boy if you run into a lion don't move 
we lived under apartheid regime 
and then in the same year we almost lost everything 
with independence the whole approach of community getting involved was embraced by our new government 
three things that actually help to build on this foundation the very first one is honoring of tradition and being open to new ideas 
and at this sacred fire the spirit of our ancestors speak through the headman and advise us where to get water where to get grazings and where to go and hunt 
transporting rhinos using helicopters i think is much easier than talking through a spirit that you can't see isn't it 
the other partners that we have got is business communities 
and so far with the support of world wildlife fund we've been able to scale up the very small programs to national programs today 
namibia  or sesfontein was no more an isolated village somewhere hidden away in namibia 
what started as very small community rangers getting community involved has now grown into something that we call conservancies 
in 2008 conservancy generated 57 million dollars 
this is our new economy -- an economy based on the respect of our natural resources 
you know that africa is being affected by these viruses 
there is great confusion when the two look at each other 
i'm fascinated by the beauty of it the mutability of it the malleability of it and the fabulous shapes in which it can carve itself 
that's outside antarctica 
it's a big undertaking i stand here before you tonight as an ambassador for my whole team 
there's a lot of people working on this right now 
if everybody in the developed world understood this graph and emblazoned it on the inside of their foreheads there would be no further societal argument about climate change because this is the story that counts 
this is what one of our cameras saw over the course of a few months 
that's the retreat of this glacier 
geologic process in action here 
greenland took a little while to start reacting to the warming climate of the past century but it really started galloping along about 20 years ago 
helicopter in front of the calving face for scale quickly dwarfed 
it's flowing out to the atlantic ocean on the left 
we just downloaded these pictures a couple weeks ago as you can see june 25th monster calving events happened 
huge icebergs rolling over 
so an illustration again gives you a feeling for scale 
this is a terrific terrific call to arms to do the right thing for ourselves and for the future 
understanding all of this enables us to shift our perception of seafood away from a commodity to an opportunity to restore our ecosystem 
great for fishermen lots of money supporting local economies 
so the first thing about this idea of restorative seafood is that it really takes into account our needs 
and the best part is all of those ingredients are available to every family at the neighborhood walmart 
forget nuclear holocaust it's the fork that we have to worry about 
people started buying appetizers and salads because they knew they weren't going to fill up on the entrees alone 
people spent more time engaging in their meals engaging with each other over their meals 
they got healthier i made more money 
i get sick when i go to steakhouses 
the punch line 
and this is a song medley i put together --  did you ever notice that four in the morning has become some sort of meme or shorthand 
a time for plotting to whack the chief of police like in this classic scene from the godfather 
it works a little something like -- this is a recent google search for four in the morning 
coincidence to me has a much simpler metric 
herbert powell sure that's what he's paid for 
and folks you can buy a copy of bill clinton's my life from the bookstore here at ted 
by his own writing this man was either asleep at a prayer meeting with al and tipper or learning how to launch a nuclear missile out of a suitcase 
and once we get involved in the therapeutic decisions again either personally or with our loved ones and family members we also very quickly learn the benefits the trade-offs and the limitations of these tools 
we can all picture astronauts in space 
and in that space station we have the genetic material the chromosomes within a nucleus 
and when that cellular space station is within the electric field it acts on those highly charged proteins and aligns them 
what we saw in that trial is that that the life expectancies of both groups -- so the chemotherapy treated group and the tumor treating field group -- was the same 
importantly it was the first time ever that the fda included in their approval of an oncology treatment a quality of life claim 
you can see that the black regions in the upper right quadrant are the areas where he had surgery 
at this point he was told by his doctors that he had about 3 months to live 
first of all these electrodes are noninvasive 
there's none of what is called the chemo head 
it's a medical device it works when it's on 
it's now five years since robert's diagnosis and he's alive but importantly he's healthy and he's at work 
i'm going to let him in this very short clip describe his impressions of the therapy in his own words 
i'm going to show you another clip of a woman named lydia 
she underwent four different regimes of chemotherapy over two years none of which had an effect 
her cancer continued to grow 
she's interacting with her kids and her grand kids 
it's only the beginning 
and i firmly believe that in the next 10 years tumor treating fields will be a weapon available to doctors and patients for all of these most-difficult-to-treat solid tumors 
and the water will go where it should go 
and people made their house and the water storage tanks 
this is near jaipur this is called the jaigarh fort 
it can break sometimes 
it can envy many municipalities the color the taste the purity of this water 
and people started renovating their own structures 
such a limited rainfall and highest colorful life flourished in these areas 
but it is invisible 
and then they will come and worship this pond pay respect their gratitude 
and perhaps they knew the future also 
how they maintain them 
don't spit don't do anything wrong so that the clean water can be collected 
if you climb these three six steps you will find something very nice 
they say that a picture is worth a thousand words so we can say a thousand words right now an another thousand words 
there were no english medium schools at that time even no hindi schools [unclear] schools 
but not to create the engineering colleges 
so you can find through your jeep a camel and a cart 
thank you very much 
so the ponds the open bodies are everywhere right from sri lanka to kashmir and in other parts also 
and these [unclear] which stored water there are two type of things 
it was never popular with many political leaders especially those in the united states who somehow thought that new media would be able to do what missiles couldn't 
and they are building what i call the spinternet 
and police said that it happened because he was playing hide and seek which is elude the cat in chinese slang with other inmates and hit his head against the wall which was not an explanation which sat well with many chinese bloggers 
so they immediately began posting a lot of critical comments 
and this actually fits with another interesting theory about what's happening in authoritarian states and in their cyberspace 
and first it's quite simple 
so from this perspective having blogs and wikis produce knowledge has been great 
so inviting people to all sorts of public forums having them participate in decision making it's actually great 
and it's great simply because they can gather open source intelligence 
i mean kgb and not just kgb used to torture in order to actually get this data 
now it's all available online 
so what should we do about it 
why are you crying 
no the boy said to me -- the boy said to me it would destroy me 
and he did spend a lot of time up to no good 
his father wasn't on the set 
we all looked up to him 
she's what i know today to be mentally ill higher-functioning at times than others 
so when i go in the room i close the door 
now i say this all with remorse and i was feeling a tremendous amount of remorse at that time but i was conflicted because while i was feeling remorse i was excited because i didn't get caught 
i need you working with me and me working with you on how we raise our sons and teach them to be men -- that it's okay to not be dominating that it's okay to have feelings and emotions that it's okay to promote equality that it's okay to have women who are just friends and that's it that it's okay to be whole that my liberation as a man is tied to your liberation as a woman  
indeed what worries me is the entire notion of world leadership seems to me terribly archaic 
it's redolent of james bond movies and kipling ballads 
and in the information era we all live in today what we might call the ted age i'd say that countries are increasingly being judged by a global public that's been fed on an incessant diet of internet news of televised images of cellphone videos of email gossip 
we've been selling 15 million cellphones a month 
they had to suspend functions at 830 
and they scrawled on the windshield in a reference to the show's heroine tulsi zindabad long live tulsi 
in fact legend has is that when doubting thomas the apostle saint thomas landed on the shores of kerala my home state somewhere around 52 ad he was welcomed on shore by a flute-playing jewish girl 
but the fact is that the last elections five years ago gave the world extraordinary phenomenon of an election being won by a woman political leader of italian origin and roman catholic faith sonia gandhi who then made way for a sikh mohan singh to be sworn in as prime minister by a muslim president abdul kalam in a country 81 percent hindu 
all the others have been all those three 
in fact you can't even take the name of the country for granted because the name india comes from the river indus which flows in pakistan 
it's the idea of an ever-ever-land emerging from an ancient civilization united by a shared history but sustained above all by pluralist democracy 
now that is the india that is emerging into the 21st century 
and i mean the world apparently is running out too 
and trying to attach this to things that were themselves attached to certain specific target zones bacteria that we don't like 
so you can find a little feature on a bacterium that you don't like like staphylococcus -- i don't like it in particular because it killed a professor friend of mine last year 
so this was pretty shocking to me that we could do this 
and there's the very important thing there if you want to survive the cold you ought to be suspended right 
the highest concentration is in our brains 
and so we wanted to find out might we be able to use hydrogen sulfide in the presence of cold and we wanted to see whether we could reproduce this skier in a mammal 
so we wondered can we do anything useful with this capacity to control metabolic flexibility 
we ought to be able to lower supply to unprecedented low levels without killing the animal 
and this company the first thing it did was make a liquid formulation of hydrogen sulfide an injectable form that we could put in and send it out to physician scientists all over the world who work on models of critical care medicine and the results are incredibly positive 
and i should say that the concentrations of hydrogen sulfide required to get this benefit are low incredibly low 
you don't want to be gorking people out just to save them it's really confusing 
i’m going around the world giving talks about darwin and usually what i’m talking about is darwin’s strange inversion of reasoning 
exactly exactly and it is a strange inversion 
if you looked at glucose molecules till you were blind you wouldn’t see why they tasted sweet 
and it’s a good thing that there isn’t because if there were then mother nature would have a problem how on earth do you get chimps to mate 
what we see with say chocolate cake is it’s a supernormal stimulus to tweak our design wiring 
you’ve got 30 seconds you’d better be fast 
yes lot’s of laughter yeah exactly 
so we might have a wild idea but we’re afraid to share it with anybody else 
they just quite happily show their masterpiece to whoever wants to look at it 
now that wasn’t just self-indulgence 
it takes more than decor but i think we’ve all seen that creative companies do often have symbols in the workplace that remind people to be playful and that it’s a permissive environment 
but why is it important 
we use it in a pretty pragmatic way to be honest 
and you know the more creative of them might get to a really interesting example 
so another one of bob mckim’s favorite exercises is called the 30 circles test 
okay put down your pencils as they say 
15 20 anybody get all 30 
i just wanted you to fill in as many circles as possible 
we stop ourselves from doing things 
i think the eameses are wonderful examples of experimentation 
they went from designing splints for wounded soldiers coming out of world war ii and the korean war i think and from this experiment they moved on to chairs 
when play is about building a tower out of blocks the kid begins to learn a lot about towers 
and as they repeatedly knock it down and start again learning is happening as a sort of by-product of play 
so they learned their way to that by building prototypes 
and all of a sudden a productive conversation was happening about design around a tangible object 
the prototyping carts filled with colored paper and play-doh and glue sticks and stuff -- i mean they do have a bit of a kindergarten feel to them 
but by giving project teams and the clients who they’re working with permission to think with their hands quite complex ideas can spring into life and go right through to execution much more easily 
we’re doing the same thing as designers 
so remember the sketching task we did at the beginning 
as designers we need to be able to transition in and out of play also 
and it doesn't take long to go downhill 
and i got distracted by it 
and suddenly i was on the phone to my stockbroker and my real estate agent when i should have been talking to my clients 
my partner and i thom we had to let all our employees go 
because with no employees there was nobody for me to manage 
and i grew up in this little farming town in northern nevada 
britlin was so innocent and so sweet and her voice was so pure 
and i had this idea if i could get 50 people to all do this same thing sing their parts -- soprano alto tenor and bass -- wherever they were in the world post their videos to youtube we could cut it all together and create a virtual choir 
and i sent out this call to singers 
and i made free the download of the music to a piece that i had written in the year 2000 called lux aurumque which means light and gold 
this is evangelina etienne  from massachusetts 
i was told later and also by lots of singers who were involved in this that they sometimes recorded 50 or 60 different takes until they got just the right take -- they uploaded it 
he scrubbed the audio 
and then we posted this video to youtube about a year and a half ago 
we had a million hits in the first month and got a lot of attention for it 
and there were 900 people involved in that 
and we also put a page on facebook for the singers to upload their testimonials what it was like for them their experience singing it 
my sister and i used to sing in choirs together constantly 
me too 
it is a dream come true to be part of this choir as i've never been part of one 
and the second is that people seem to be experiencing an actual connection 
it wasn't a virtual choir 
but i know myself too i feel this virtual esprit de corps if you will with all of them 
this is a recording i made of a mantis shrimp that's found off the coast of california 
and mantis shrimp are called mantis shrimp after the praying mantises which also have a fast feeding appendage and i started to think well maybe it will be interesting while listening to their sounds to figure out how these animals generate very fast feeding strikes 
so we got this incredible video system it's very new technology -- it just came out about a year ago -- that allows you to film at extremely high speeds in low light 
and as you'll notice it's still pretty gosh darn fast slowed down 333 times it's an incredibly powerful movement 
so what we calculated was that the limbs were moving at the peak speed ranging from 10 meters per second all the way up to 23 meters per second 
it takes a long time for the muscle to contract and a very short time for the limb to fly out 
there needs to be some kind of spring-loaded mechanism in order to generate the amount of force that we observe and the speed that we observe and the output of the system 
the saddle-shaped structure is also known as a hyperbolic paraboloid surface or an anticlastic surface 
in biological systems it's important not to have a whole lot of extra material requirements for building it 
and so this is just a regular video of the animal just smashing the heck out of this load cell 
and again i think this will be a world record 
and what i'd like you to do in this shot is keep your eye on this on the surface of the load cell as the limb comes flying through 
people have been struggling for years to try and design a very fast rotating boat propeller that doesn't cavitate and literally wear away the metal and put holes in it just like these pictures show 
in fact you might have even seen some cavitation going up the edge of the limb 
very very convenient solution to that particular problem 
and there's actually a spectacular colored dot in the center of the saddles of many species of stomatopods 
and this is quite interesting to find evolutionary origins of visual signals on what's really in all species their spring 
and so i'm very curious about whether those colored dots in the center of the saddles are conveying some kind of information about their ability to strike or their strike force and something about the time period in the molting cycle 
we still have one foot in the dark ages 
ts eliot really said it for me -- and this should give you goose bumps we shall not cease from exploration and the end of our exploring shall be to return where we started and know the place for the first time 
it’s a thin film two-dimensional existence 
and if you hefted those two things you might find that the relative scale of those is 20 to 1 
it actually is a very good working sub -- that’s what it was designed for 
a seat works in a two-dimensional world where gravity blasts down on that seat ok 
most of life on earth is in that inner atmosphere 
this is a three-dimensional machine 
this is man’s first attempt at flying underwater 
chris asked us to show stuff that hasn’t been shown before 
i’m trying to do everything very gently 
this is the first flying machine this was the first prototype 
there’re no silly buoyancy tanks -- it’s permanently positively buoyant 
she’s just a few inches off the top of my head 
and so how i see my work contributing is sort of trying to literally re-imagine these connections and physically rebuild them 
so the era of big infrastructure is over 
so albeit a very small creature and very modest this creature is incredible because it can agglomerate into these mega-reef structures 
but you can see even just intuit from this map that the harbor has dredged and flattened and went from a rich three-dimensional mosaic to flat muck in really a matter of years 
now the gowanus is particularly smelly -- i will admit it 
when we started this project one of the core ideas was to look back in history and try to understand what was there 
we also learned at this time that you could eat an oyster about the size of a dinner plate in the gowanus canal itself 
it accepts algae and detritus in one end and through this beautiful glamorous set of stomach organs out the other end comes cleaner water 
basically new york was built on the backs of oystermen and our streets were literally built over oyster shells 
what is fuzzy rope you ask 
so we imagine that we would actually potentially even host a bake sale to start our new project 
so get your tevas on 
and then those spat are then seeded 
and also showing oyster gardening for the community along its edges 
and finally how much fun it would be to watch the flupsy parade and cheer on the oyster spats as they go down to the reef 
so sorry -- it just feels like i should be doing stand-up up here because of the setting 
because if we get it out of the streets it'll smell much better and -- oh right we drink from the river 
and he'd made the case in a number of papers and done a number of studies but nothing had really stuck 
you can't really see it in this map but this is the map that becomes the central focus in the second half of my book 
so it was this incredibly terrifying event 
just an extraordinary terrifying scene 
and eventually snow made a map of the outbreak 
and he thought about representing that as a kind of a table of statistics of people living in different neighborhoods people who hadn't you know percentages of people who hadn't but eventually he hit upon the idea that what he needed was something that you could see 
and so with the help of this map and with the help of more evangelizing that he did over the next few years and that whitehead did eventually actually the authorities slowly started to come around 
we don't worry that new york city is going to collapse in on itself quite the way that you know rome did and be 10 percent of its size in 100 years or 200 years 
his whole monastery was thrown into prison at the time of the uprising when the dalai lama had to leave tibet 
and it just so happened on the fifth week there was a public teaching by the dalai lama 
i interview and do portraits 
so this is our icon to non-violence in our world -- one of our living icons 
this is mengatoue 
he's the shaman of the huaorani and he said to us you know i'm an older man now i'm getting tired you know i'm tired of spearing these oil workers 
and this kid lived in the village -- he wasn't there at the time -- and this is the little movie he put together about that 
it's a question of what's the continuity 
we draw this set of nested spheres cut away so you see it 
so if you take a picture of what's going on it's 10 years ago 
and we go through a period of accelerating expansion and the universe expands and cools until it gets to the point where it becomes transparent then to the dark ages and then the first stars turn on and they evolve into galaxies and then later they get to the more expansive galaxies 
i always think of space-time as being the real substance of space and the galaxies and the stars just like the foam on the ocean 
and just put radially they're going out that way 
what happens is you take pictures as the earth rotates you get a fan across the sky 
do you see the fan-like scans made across the sky 
so again you can see the extension of this great wall of galaxies showing up here 
and we had to add one more thing to make the universe come out right 
so i'll show you the next movie 
we're going to keep zooming in ok 
and so i forgot to tell you the scale 
so it takes light three billion years to travel over that distance 
there's a very simple fluid to begin with 
and so you know when you first saw this picture it didn't mean quite so much to you 
here you're looking across one percent of the volume of the visible universe and you're seeing billions of galaxies right and nodes but you realize they're not even the main structure 
and we're going to fly around and we'll fly around and you'll see occasionally a couple of filaments intersect and you get a large cluster of galaxies 
so the question is how hard would it be to assemble this right 
and so here we are 
this is how if you took billions of years to go around it might look to you right 
and if you could see invisible matter too 
we're going to start and realize that the entire visible universe everything we can see in every direction with the hubble space telescope plus our other instruments was once in a region that was smaller than an atom 
so i'm going to show you one that can be run on a desktop in two days in the next picture 
and at that point the universe mysteriously starts accelerating its expansion and cuts off the formation of larger-scale structure 
the fact is that we're living longer 
it really involves many different areas 
and that's where the field is today 
we then grow the cells outside the body take the scaffold coat the scaffold with the cells -- the patient's own cells two different cell types 
so the strategy here is -- this is actually a ct scan an x-ray -- and we go layer by layer using computerized morphometric imaging analysis and 3d reconstruction to get right down to those patient's own kidneys 
and this is actually a new technology we're working on now 
i was able to do more things 
most of my professors were all for it and they said bring pictures and show me the clips online and i'm happy for you 
'i failed' he cried 
one was -- never be late never be late 
that's what he tried to teach me and my brothers at one time 
he spelled moriarty with only one 'i' 
you and i know deeper down there's always a chance to win the crown 
giving all it seems to me is not so far from victory 
don't whine don't complain don't make excuses 
not necessary to what you would want them to be but they will be about what they should and only you will know whether you can do that 
i mention in my book they call me coach 
so they had qualities that -- they came close to -- as close to reaching possibly their full potential as any players i ever had 
so in other words what's happening here is that swaptree solves my carrying company's sugar rush problem a problem the economists call the coincidence of wants in approximately 60 seconds 
so what's happening here 
we're bartering trading swapping sharing but they're being reinvented into dynamic and appealing forms 
over the next minute you're going to see a bit like a conceptual fireworks display of all the dots that went on in my head 
i mean we're monkeys and we're born and bred to share and cooperate 
and we were doing so for thousands of years whether it's when we hunted in packs or farmed in cooperatives before this big system called hyper-consumption came along and we built these fences and created out own little fiefdoms 
they're growing up sharing -- files video games knowledge 
thomas friedman is one of my favorite new york times columnists and he poignantly commented that 2008 is when we hit a wall when mother nature and the market both said no more 
the second is collaborative lifestyles 
just think of libraries and laundrettes 
they are what i consider to be the cities of tomorrow the new urban world 
now why do i say that 
after we finished armstrong straightened his tie put on a wool sports jacket and we headed out into the glare 
i thought they might be playing king of the hill but i was wrong 
'it's a simple life but nobody is restricting you 
beer is a very important thing in brazil 
this here on the right-hand side is what's called a -- if you look at the fine print under the awning -- it's a hotel 
and the second aspect is that once you have 2000 people in the community you can petition the government to be recognized as a legal sub-municipality 
my family moved we're nomads 
but these two people worked something out 
right now those and other neurologic diseases -- for which we have no cure or prevention -- cost about a third of a trillion dollars a year 
it will be well over a trillion dollars by 2050 
and the avian flu is also not a good idea 
you should also keep your blood pressure down because chronic high blood pressure is the biggest single risk factor for alzheimer’s disease 
and of course when it comes to cognitive effects use it or lose it applies so you want to stay mentally stimulated 
and one of the first things that i started to investigate was the history of the name of technology 
and obviously technology had existed before then but we weren't aware of it and so it was sort of an awakening of this force in our life 
and that's the very first use of the word 
even the hunter-gatherers used some elementary tools 
so climate change is not a new thing 
and flowers and plants are the same thing extended and technology is basically an extension of life 
and the energy density that we see in the greatest of anywhere in the universe is actually in a pc chip 
and there are things moving towards greater complexity moving towards greater diversity moving towards greater specialization sentience ubiquity and most important evolvability those very same things are also present in technology 
he could buy things that king henry in all his wealth could never buy 
and what i mean by that is that we find a new job for it 
so better ideas is really -- always the response to technology that we don't like is basically better technology 
and so every technology is sort of a creative force looking for the right job 
and we are aware of the price 
great movement that is starting billions of years ago is moving through us and it continues to go and our choice so to speak in technology is really to align ourselves with this force much greater than ourselves 
i really appreciate your attention today thank you 
neil and i were sitting there comparing how little we've slept in anticipation for this i've never been so nervous -- and i do this when i'm nervous i just realized  
in the brooklyn neighborhood that i lived in park slope there are a lot of writers -- it's like a very high per capita ratio of writers to normal people 
so when i moved back to san francisco we rented this building 
so we thought we'll have all these writers and editors and everybody -- sort of a writing community -- coming into the office every day anyway why don't we just open up the front of the building for students to come in there after school get extra help on their written homework so you have basically no border between these two communities 
and we looked around and somebody else said well you should sell supplies to the working buccaneer  
this is replacement eyes in case you lose one 
while you're reading the sign we pull a rope behind the counter and eight mop heads drop on your head 
it became mop heads and this is the fish theater which is just a saltwater tank with three seats and then right behind it we set up this space which was the tutoring center 
and we thought oh they're going to storm the gates they're gonna love it and they didn't 
you know it's been proven that 35 to 40 hours a year with one-on-one attention a student can get one grade level higher 
but there was something psychological happening there that was just a little bit different 
they're allowed to go home at 530 pm enjoy their family enjoy other hobbies get outside play 
then we said well what are we going to do with the space during the day because it has to be used before 230 pm 
so this is one of the books that they do 
so meanwhile there's an adult in the back typing this up taking it completely seriously which blows their mind 
it's right off the library and there we serve all 529 kids in this middle school 
you can see amy tan sponsored the next one i might get somewhere 
we sell all the student books 
they would say what is this 
so the store actually did really well 
this is sam potts' great design that did this 
this is a little vault -- you have to put your product in there it goes up an electric lift and then the guy behind the counter tells you that you have to recite the vow of heroism which you do if you want to buy anything and it limits really their sales 
so then the secret door -- this is one of the shelves you don't see when you walk in but it slowly opens 
this is one of the students khaled hamdan 
came in got this concentrated attention 
i'm going to switch to we and not i hope we hope that the attendees of this conference will usher in a new era of participation in our public schools 
we hope that you will take the lead in partnering your innovative spirit and expertise with that of innovative educators in your community 
hot studio did a great job in a very tight deadline so visit the site 
i've been a priest in the church for 20 years 
do we really believe that god is the kind of male boss that we've been presenting in our worship and in our liturgies over all these years 
suggesting that god expresses himself or herself through powerlessness rather than power 
acknowledging that god is unknown and unknowable by definition 
and this is what i said 
and we want an explanation from god 
for hundreds of years the prevailing orthodoxy the accepted truth was that god the father the creator is unchanging and therefore by definition cannot feel pain or sadness 
and the devastating events of the 20th century have forced people to question the cold unfeeling god 
who is god in all this 
do we have a local god who can do little things like parking spaces but not big things like 500 mile-per-hour waves 
that's just not acceptable to intelligent christians and we must acknowledge it 
you probably heard some of them the man who surfed the wave the teenage girl who recognized the danger because she had just been learning about tsunamis at school 
if we believe something like this we must let go of the puppet-master completely take our leave of the almighty controller abandon traditional models 
maybe god isn't an agent like all of us are agents 
the people knew their god by his mighty acts 
in the incredible intricacy and magnificence of the natural world 
in the end we have to say i don't know 
to have faith in this god would be more like trusting an essential benevolence in the universe and less like believing a system of doctrinal statements 
and how would one deepen such a faith 
but in the end the only thing i could say for sure was i don't know and that just might be the most profoundly religious statement of all 
it was deep at night 
and i kept on staring at it until it disappeared 
this is not a story of a nameless survivor of war and nameless refugees whose stereotypical images we see in our newspapers and our tv with tattered clothes dirty face scared eyes 
war a friend of mine said is not about sound at all 
it is actually about silence the silence of humanity 
i have since left iraq and founded a group called women for women international that ends up working with women survivors of wars 
she said but it's not fair because there is only one life and there should only be one death 
ninety percent of modern war casualties are civilians 
how interesting 
there is a side that is led by men and there is a side that is led by women 
there is no way we can talk about the building of stability if we don't start investing in women and girls 
she got into women for women international's program 
to start with these women that i told you about are dancing and singing every single day and if they can who are we not to dance 
by accepting this dichotomy whether it's tongue-in-cheek when we attempt to accommodate it in our world and we try to build our foundation for the world we're messing up the future because who wants to be uncreative 
now i grew up in the '60s and i'll admit it actually my childhood spanned the '60s and i was a wannabe hippie and i always resented the fact that i wasn't really old enough to be a hippie 
and i know there are people here the younger generation who want to be hippies but people talk about the '60s all the time and they talk about the anarchy that was there but when i think about the '60s what i took away from it was that there was hope for the future 
you see i always assumed i would go into space because i followed all of this but i also loved the arts and sciences 
now my mother helped me figure that one out  
but when i went into space when i went into space i carried a number of things up with me i carried a poster by alvin ailey which you can figure out now i love the dance company 
and yeah sub-atomic physics is deconstructive you literally try to tear atoms apart to understand what's inside of them but sculpture from what i understand from great sculptors is deconstructive because you see a piece and you remove what doesn't need to be there 
it's the universe as experienced by everyone and the arts manifest our desire our attempt to share or influence others through experiences that are peculiar to us as individuals 
do you know these books these such and such for dummies 
but i was looking online at amazoncom for other books like this 
there's a sort of business model around being stupid in some sense 
i was in milan last week for the italian launch 
so it was traumatizing actually 
modernism means white box and it's a perfect white box 
i have a default title as a father of a bunch of daughters 
as a child we used to wake up at 1 am and work till 6 pm six days a week 
thank you 
but the media lab is an interesting place and it's important to me because as a student i was a computer science undergrad and i discovered design later on in my life 
and there was this person muriel cooper 
it was the best advice i ever got so i went to art school because of her 
i think that the mentors that we all meet sort of humanize us 
so if you sort of compare that like this you'll see that computer versus human -- i've been tracking this for the last year -- computer versus human over the last year has changed 
i spent my entire early career making complex stuff 
lots of complex stuff 
this is a floral theme calendar in 1997 and this is a firework calendar so you launch the number into space because the japanese believe that when you see fireworks you're cooler for some reason 
i've been lucky to have been there before people made these kind of things and so i made all this kind of stuff that messes with your eyes 
and eye meat is something different something more fibrous something more powerful perhaps but what could that be eye meat 
so i went back to the computer and i bought five large fries and scanned them all and i was looking for some kind of food theme and i wrote some software to automatically lay out french-fry images 
and also as a child i was the fattest kid in class so i used to love cheetos oh i love cheetos yummy 
i discovered that cheetos are good expressive material 
it's a strange business model i can come into work everyday and staple five pieces of paper and just stare at it with my latte 
in japan they say that sushi is challenging 
this book i wrote because i want to figure out life 
he's an expert in aging this horizontal axis is how old you are -- twelve years old twenty-four years old seventy-four ninety-six years old -- and this is some medical data so brain strength increases up to 60 and then after 60 it sort of goes down kind of depressing in a way 
your social responsibility is very interesting 
how dare we be optimistic 
but as important as it is to change the lightbulbs it is more important to change the laws 
and there are lots of those but the climate crisis is the rare but all-important global or strategic conflict 
greenland remains twenty-eight years ago this is what the polar ice cap -- the north polar ice cap -- looked like at the end of the summer at the fall equinox 
this last fall i went to the snow and ice data center in boulder colorado and talked to the researchers here in monterey at the naval postgraduate laboratory 
the north polar ice cap is the same size geographically -- doesn't look quite the same size -- but it is exactly the same size as the united states minus an area roughly equal to the state of arizona 
they have exactly the same amount of carbon 
what is missing is a sense of urgency 
nbc -- i'll show all of the networks here -- the top journalists for nbc asked 956 questions in 2007 of the presidential candidates two of them were about the climate crisis abc 844 questions two about the climate crisis 
this is gasoline consumption in all of these countries and us 
we have the technologies 
we have to have a unified view of how to go about this the struggle against poverty in the world and the challenge of cutting wealthy country emissions all has a single very simple solution 
but responses can actually make a huge difference in the poor countries this is a proposal that has been talked about a lot in europe 
lot of other things contributed to it but the new prime minister announced that his very first priority would be to change australia's position on kyoto and he has now they came to an awareness partly because of the horrible drought that they have had 
but we have a planetary emergency 
if we had just one week's worth of what we spend on the iraq war we could be well on the way to solving this challenge 
this challenge is part of the fabric of our whole civilization 
demand -- change the light bulbs but change the laws change the global treaties 
now nobody is talking on that scale but i do believe that between now and november it is possible 
in terms of your own personal role going forward al is there something more than that you would like to be doing 
al gore thank you so much for coming to ted 
and that's certainly how it seemed to me when i started this project 
all this noise around us actually has information 
so what i started thinking was perhaps there is something like open source intelligence here 
so we started doing this and you can see here on the horizontal axis you've got the number of people killed in an attack or the size of the attack 
you take all of the conflict all of the chaos all of the noise and out of that comes this precise mathematical distribution of the way attacks are ordered in this conflict 
and we found that not only were the distributions these straight lines but the slope of these lines they clustered around this value of alpha equals 25 
and we could generate an equation that could predict the likelihood of an attack 
this is data statistics what does it tell us about these conflicts 
turns out we kind of do a reasonable job 
so what's going on 
why should these different -- seemingly different conflicts have the same patterns 
what does it look like 
we can push it up the forces become more fragmented there is more of them but they are weaker 
the opposite happened 
the groups became stronger 
but designers are great at taking big revolutions that happen and transforming them so that we can use them 
you work over different time zones you talk to very different people you multitask we all know it and we do it kind of automatically 
and all of a sudden scientists are seeking designers just like designers are seeking scientists 
and keith has come and also jonathan has come and many others 
and it was great because at the beginning was this apology fest -- you know scientists would tell designers you know i don't know what style is i'm not really elegant 
paul steinhardt a physicist from new york and aranda/lasch architects collaborated in an installation in london at the serpentine 
i'm showing to you different sections of the show right now just to give you a taste of it 
in this case i'm showing more the designers' work because they're the ones that have really been stimulated 
but the problem is that it's a really ugly patty 
when you don't have to kill cows and it can have any shape what should it be like 
one of the most important topics of the show -- you know as anything in our life today we can look at it from many many different viewpoints and at different levels 
one of the most interesting and most important concepts is the idea of scale we change scale very often we change resolution of screens and we're not really fazed by it we do it very comfortably 
you can be in the subway and you can be completely isolated and have your own room in your ipod 
again this communal sense of experience that seems to be so important today 
and so this student at the rca designed this beautiful blown-glass object where the bees move from one chamber to the other if they detect that particular smell that signifies in this case pregnancy 
design for debate is a very interesting new endeavor that designers have really shaped for themselves 
and usually they are accompanied by videos 
it's quite amazing how these things can make you smile can make you laugh can make you cry sometimes 
thank you very much 
the only trouble is the people next door i can't stand them 
and yet if i just allowed myself to be overwhelmed by these feelings i wouldn't be doing my job -- because i have to actually be there for them and make sure that rituals happen that practicalities are seen to 
who cannot be touched by compassion when we see the terrible horrors of the results of war or famine or earthquakes or tsunamis 
and of course you can't do that unless you understand yourself a bit more 
therefore there should be justice throughout the world 
so like snoopy we can't just lie there and think great thoughts about our neighbors 
there has to be a willingness to do good deeds but not of course at the expense of our own sanity 
what does this compassion entail 
and as many people do he was dozing off during the sermon 
and he rushed home and after the sabbath he made 12 loaves of bread took them to the synagogue went into the synagogue opened the ark and said god i don't know why you want this bread but here you are 
and he called the two of them to his office 
you mean god didn't want my bread 
and the rabbi said you've misunderstood me 
you've misunderstood totally he said 
please keep your seat 
wrap it in an ace bandage take some ibuprofen for a week or two and that's the end of the story 
how can the nervous system get this so wrong 
in your house wires run in the wall from the light switch to a junction box in the ceiling and from the junction box to the light bulb 
it's almost as if somebody came into your home and rewired your walls so that the next time you turned on the light switch the toilet flushed three doors down or your dishwasher went on or your computer monitor turned off 
if you look out your window and you can see long's peak you're probably familiar with it 
take meeker mt meeker lump that in there and put that in space as well and mt everest and k2 and the indian peaks 
because back then video cameras were just starting to become popular and people would bring them parents would bring them to their kids' football games to film their kids play football and since this came in on a friday they were able to get this great footage of this thing breaking up as it came in over west virgina maryland pennsylvania and new jersey until it did that to a car in new york 
this did a huge amount of damage 
the one over tunguska was probably made of rock and that's much more crumbly so it blew up in the air either way these are tremendous explosions 20 megatons 
i don't think apophis is a problem 
in fact apophis is a blessing in disguise because it woke us up to the dangers of these things 
well let me ask you what happens if you're standing in the middle of the road and a car's headed for you what do you do you do this 
i think even nasa can do that and they proved that they can  
after the big macho rrrrrrr bam we're gonna hit this thing in the face then we bring in the velvet gloves 
there's a group of scientists and engineers and astronauts and they call themselves the b612 foundation for those of you who've read the little prince you understand that reference i hope the little prince who lived on an asteroid it was called b612 
so think about this right 
now those of you who are lucky enough to live in those societies that represent 17 percent i think should enjoy it until it lasts 
my story starts -- the story i want to share -- starts in 1991 
the problem was that we had to re-tape that history a week later because if we did not we could not afford enough tapes to keep archives of that history 
so here we are having our first client brilliant 
it's a kind of very nice sophisticated way how to economically strangle a daily newspaper 
and we said that's fine let's meet you'll bring us your business plan which eventually they did 
we start the meeting 
but however you put it you know the numbers do not make any sense 
we were the best that they could do 
we do it in 17 countries of the developing world 
so what the governor got was an empty shell 
so from that perspective what we did is just really one drop in the sea of that need that we can identify 
imagine two thirds over here running excellent organizations doing very important work 
now imagine that every second person over here is deaf does not hear and switch the lights off 
so we thought that some kind of a big idea is needed to reform to totally rethink fundraising 
and then two weeks later iqbal quadir can issue his electricity in bangladesh bonds 
so indeed i have spent my life looking into the lives of presidents who are no longer alive 
so since i tell stories let me look back on the lives of two of the presidents i've studied to illustrate this point -- abraham lincoln and lyndon johnson 
but he read books in every spare moment he could find 
three things had combined to lay him low 
he was so depressed that friends worried he was suicidal 
and his great friend speed went to his side and said lincoln you must rally or you will die 
and with a beauty of language -- almost as if the shakespeare and the poetry he had so loved as a child had worked their way into his very soul 
knowing that tolstoy was in their midst they asked him to tell stories of the great men of history 
but instead surprisingly he said oh bring her down here for a year and if i can't win her over no one can 
but they were great nonetheless 
but i also worried that part of it was that i was then a young woman 
and there was wine and cheese and a red-checked tablecloth -- all the romantic trappings 
and the british people were still upset about losing the revolution so they decided to embarrass him a little bit by putting a huge picture of general washington in the only outhouse where he'd have to encounter it 
which allows me from the beginning of spring training to the end of the fall to have something to occupy my mind and heart other than my work 
but it so happened he was speaking in a protestant church 
so i went to my father in tears what are we going to do 
i tried to sandwich it in between talking too much in church wishing harm to others being mean to my sisters 
well here's an example from my own experience 
there are lots of people who believe that and i think it is utter baloney 
i think that's the main point to be made 
and i won't go into a lot of stuff about quantum mechanics and what it's like and so on 
there are even movies about it with a lot of wrong stuff 
and in a lot of familiar cases they of course are 
so it's not a theory of everything and in fact a huge amount of the information in the universe around us comes from those accidents and not just from the fundamental laws 
you know what it means a circle for example is symmetric under rotations about the center of the circle 
maxwell's equations are of course symmetrical under rotations of all of space 
the next -- second -- equation says that there is no magnetism other than that 
so here we say again what we said before that each skin of the onion shows a similarity to the adjoining skins 
and therefore it looks beautiful because we already know how to write it in a lovely concise way 
steps toward unification exhibit the simplicity 
symmetry exhibits the simplicity 
now who today would claim that as a mere conceit of the human mind 
they are what we call emergent properties 
you don't need -- you don't need something more to get something more 
life can emerge from physics and chemistry plus a lot of accidents 
the things we make have one supreme quality -- they live longer than us 
we perish they survive we have one life they have many lives and in each life they can mean different things 
the central element still of the notion of return a central part of the life of judaism 
all of those are respected by cyrus 
it left a dream of the middle east as a unit and a unit where people of different faiths could live together 
for them of course it can't possibly by marduk that made all this happen 
and it's quite clear the cylinder is older than the text of isaiah and yet jehovah is speaking in words very similar to those used by marduk 
the state of israel is setup and 50 years later in the late 60s it's clear that britain's role as the imperial power is over 
it's shown being presented here put into its case by the director of the national museum of tehran one of the many women in iran in very senior positions mrs ardakani 
and it's the subject of a huge debate about what this cylinder means what cyrus means but above all cyrus as articulated through this cylinder -- cyrus as the defender of the homeland the champion of course of iranian identity and of the iranian peoples tolerant of all faiths 
will iran set free the people that the tyrants have enslaved and expropriated 
a replica of this is at the united nations 
but i think it's possible that the most powerful and the wisest voice of all of them may well be the voice of this mute thing the cyrus cylinder 
making sense of those things is a very difficult thing to do 
in fact i have got qualifications 
so i started thinking about peace and i was obviously as i said to you very much moved by these images trying to make sense of that 
could i go and speak to older and wiser people who would tell me how they made sense of the things that are going on 
and that was when i had the idea 
there was no day of global unity 
and that's why we wanted it to be the 21st of september as the date of peace 
could you give me a flight because we're going to go see him 
and of course we went and saw him and it was amazing 
and just staying in the moment with it was a beautiful thing and really empowering actually 
and we were listening to everybody 
and working with ngos and building this case 
i felt that i was presenting a case on behalf of the global community to try and create this day 
and this young child who'd taken about an inch and a half out of her leg with no antiseptic and that young boy who was a child soldier who told me he'd killed people -- he was about 12 -- these things made me realize that this was not a film that i could just stop 
if this is the only film that i ever make i'm going to document until this becomes a reality 
the costa rican government and the british government had put forward to the united nations general assembly with 54 co-sponsors the idea of the first ever ceasefire nonviolence day the 21st of september as a fixed calendar date and it was unanimously adopted by every head of state in the world 
and as i mentioned when it started we were at the globe and there was no press 
it's been created nobody knows 
but we have to continue this journey and we have to tell people and we have to prove it can work 
and after lots and lots of meetings obviously i'm delighted that this man ahmad fawzi one of my heroes and mentors really he managed to get unicef involved 
and i saw him because he was an actor i was an actor i had a connection to him because we needed to get to the press we needed this attraction we needed the media to be involved 
because if we start pumping it up a bit maybe more people would listen and there'd be more -- when we got into certain areas maybe there would be more people interested 
i won't go into that 
so jude said okay i'll do some statements for you 
and i could sort of see a little look in his eye of interest 
so these guys were absolutely crucial 
this amazing woman fatima gailani was absolutely instrumental in what went on as she was the spokesperson for the resistance against the russians 
and her afghan network was just absolutely everywhere 
we will observe this day 
we see it as a window of opportunity 
and so then we wrapped the film up and we put it together because we had to go back 
and we wanted to go back and show them the film and say look you guys made this possible and thank you very much 
and i kept thinking about this 70 percent 
70 percent reduction in violence -- in what everyone said was completely impossible and you couldn't do 
he's an amazing man 
it's all about the individuals 
and it then made me think about a glass of water which is clear 
thank you very much thank you 
there was not a flashlight not a lantern not a candle -- pitch black 
anesthetic wears off the patient feels pain 
and her recommendation is take this opportunity to fire everyone start all over again 
now what does this have to do with leadership 
they are the elite they are our leaders 
and we need to train them right 
and one day i go to the airport to meet my father and as i walk up this grassy slope from the car park to the terminal building i'm stopped by two soldiers wielding ak-47 assault weapons 
so a few years after this event i leave ghana on a scholarship to go to swarthmore college for my education 
they wanted us to be analytical 
they wanted us to be concerned about social issues 
it was brilliant 
somebody trained them to do the work that they do 
now we cannot achieve perfection but if we reach for it then we can achieve excellence 
i don't know ultimately what they will do 
but the conversation they're having now -- about what their good society should look like what their excellent society should look like is a really good thing 
now i just wanted to leave that slide up because it's important that we think about it 
i am even more thrilled by the fact that least year our student body elected a woman to be the head of student government 
it's the first time in the history of ghana that a woman has been elected head of student government at any university 
it says a lot about her peers who elected her 
my job is to make arms and legs -- well it's not completely true 
and then not only for war victims but it was for any kind of patient 
i was also working in the orthopedic center we call it 
but it was a terrific job 
so the orthopedic center was closed because physical rehabilitation was not considered a priority 
anyway you know every time i make this speech -- it's not the first time -- but it's an emotion 
i wanted to go home i was driving 
and everybody disappeared from the street 
the man was without legs and only with one arm 
and i ask what are you doing out in the street in this situation 
and then i said oh my god what did i say 
he was coming every day crossing the front line 
two groups of mujahideen started fighting 
so we dashed all of us towards the shelter 
everybody was grabbing something 
and i will never forget mahmoud and his son walking together pushing the empty wheelchair 
i don't want them to be teased at school by the other students 
i said okay 
and then he sat down 
so the only things i could manage to obtain was a kind of a compromise 
i understood that i was wrong again 
and then we started a new policy -- a new policy completely different 
we decided to employ as many disabled as possible to train them in any possible job 
i said no no no no we can't 
and you should see me during the match 
i shout like a true italian 
in this image of the tokyo skyline i've hidden data from the newest planet-hunting space telescope on the block the kepler mission 
there we go 
and we can measure this very very precisely with kepler and trace their effects 
wrong i'm not looking at you i can't see you 
i have to do something now which seems a little bit strange for a magician 
oh they gladly sell you that yes 
but the one thing that has made a big comeback just recently is this business of speaking with the dead 
i don't think so because this subculture of people use exactly the same gimmicks that we magicians do exactly the same -- the same physical methods the same psychological methods -- and they effectively and profoundly deceive millions of people around the earth to their detriment 
good bye 
the second question that i'd like to ask rather simple suppose i ask them to contact the spirit of my deceased father-in-law as an example 
is this a hunting game 
but it is a cruel vicious absolutely conscienceless -- i'll be all right keep your seats  -- game that these people play 
folks that's what dying is all about 
now it may bring a certain amount of comfort but that comfort lasts only about 20 minutes or so 
we all know who he is on television 
he's well educated he's smart he knows what sylvia browne is doing but he doesn't give a damn 
because the bottom line is the sponsors love it and he will expose her to television publicity all the time 
now without that how could we possibly function  
she gives you the names of previous lives who you were in previous lives 
duh 
nothing is ever said about a 14 year-old bootblack in the streets of london who died of consumption 
all the more reason to take the million dollars wouldn't you think sylvia 
why don't they affect me 
now folks this is not just a metaphor i'm going to give you now it's true 
and another claim that they make -- you'll love this one -- the more dilute the medicine is they say the more powerful it is 
largely it's the media who are to blame for this sort of thing 
it's the bottom line the dollar line 
now we've offered this carrot as i say we've dangled the carrot 
ladies and gentlemen i'm james randi and i'm waiting 
and one of the major gaps in care almost across the board is access to safe surgery 
in the background there is a very sophisticated anesthesia machine 
in order to operate this machine needs a number of things that this hospital has to offer 
and finally i think you can see that infrastructure is not very strong 
similarly compressed oxygen and other medical supplies are really a luxury and can often be out of stock for months or even a year 
one of our partners at johns hopkins was observing surgeries in sierra leone about a year ago 
and the first surgery of the day happened to be an obstetrical case 
and everything began pretty auspiciously 
my colleague dr paul fenton was living this reality 
he went to work every day in an operating theater like this one trying to deliver anesthesia and teach others how to do so using that same equipment that became so unreliable and frankly unsafe in his hospital 
but this gives control to the provider whether there's power or not because they can adjust the flow based on the percentage of oxygen they see that they're giving their patient 
this is in 13 hospitals in four countries and since 2010 we've done well over 2000 surgeries with no clinically adverse events 
so we're thrilled 
because only once before has the fate of individual people and the fate of all of humanity been so intertwined 
maybe a few lung diseases here and there but you know that's not such a big deal 
but back to animals and junk food 
two both have been marketed heavily creating unnatural demand 
and they do this here it's the same deal 
that's just the united states 
there were no restaurant chains 
fats carbs proteins -- they weren't bad or good they were food 
the south and west became agricultural hubs and in other parts of the country suburbs took over farmland 
if we had a slide of salisbury steak even more so right 
thanks to farm subsidies the fine collaboration between agribusiness and congress soy corn and cattle became king 
not that they were any good but they were there 
for dessert store-bought ice cream or cookies 
so now you've got your pizza nights you've got your microwave nights you've got your grazing nights you've got your fend-for-yourself nights and so on 
meat junk food cheese the very stuff that will kill you 
so now we clamor for organic food 
i don't know 
ann cooper's right 
the usda is not our ally here 
cruelty i knew that the 10 billion animals we raise each year for meat are raised in factory farm conditions that we hypocritically wouldn't even consider for our own cats dogs and other pets 
so why was i stalling 
best of all i'm healthier i know that i'm going to live longer and i've even lost a little weight 
thank you 
some of these have already been touched upon by other speakers which is encouraging 
the first is -- death is a big problem 
sometimes we don't see a problem because either it's too familiar or it's too big 
people like -- it's roughly the population in this room has just died 
suppose we approximated one person with one book 
so that's the first big problem 
well let's first look at the probability -- and this is very very difficult to estimate -- but there have been only four studies on this in recent years which is surprising 
he estimated a probability that we will fail to survive the current century 50 percent 
another author doesn't give any numerical estimate but says the probability is significant that it will fail 
now if we think about what just reducing the probability of human extinction by just one percentage point -- not very much -- so that's equivalent to 60 million lives saved if we just count the currently living people the current generation 
the only thing you should focus on would be to reduce existential risk because even the tiniest decrease in existential risk would just overwhelm any other benefit you could hope to achieve 
and even if you just look at the current people and ignore the potential that would be lost if we went extinct it should still have a high priority 
we were very successful 
we might end up with something like this which is -- i mean it's a heck of a lot better than that 
and they also all seem a little bit -- most people have this instinct that well sure there needs to be anti-depressants for the really depressed people 
intellectual capacity -- let's take that box which falls into a lot of different sub-categories memory concentration mental energy intelligence empathy 
able to switch back and forth more easily would be a neat thing to be able to do -- easier to achieve the flow state when you're totally immersed in something you are doing 
if you could actually choose to preserve your romantic attachments to one person undiminished through time so that wouldn't have to -- love would never have to fade if you didn't want it to 
might be more complicated in humans but perhaps not that much 
well we know already that in this little human circle there there are these enormously wonderful and worthwhile modes of being -- human life at its best is wonderful 
we have no reason to believe that within this much much larger space there would not also be extremely worthwhile modes of being perhaps ones that would be way beyond our wildest ability even to imagine or dream about 
and so to fix this third problem i think we need -- slowly carefully with ethical wisdom and constraint -- develop the means that enable us to go out in this larger space and explore it and find the great values that might hide there 
the sun end was about four inches in diameter and then it tapered over about 35 feet to about a millimeter at the earth end 
so i got it down to just one tether to be able to support that 
so many forces there 
if i throw a very concentric circle or concentric ellipse it just dutifully makes these evenly spaced lines which get closer and closer together which describes how gravity works 
because since it has the ability to make forms that look like forms that we're familiar with in biology it's also making other forms that we're not familiar with 
oh let's hope so oh my god let's 
and i think nature wants to express itself in the sense that we are nature humans are of the universe 
and we are expressions of the universe basically 
as humans ultimately being part of the universe we're kind of the spokespeople or the observer part of the constituency of the universe 
and to interface with it with a device that lets these forces that are everywhere act and show what they can do giving them pigment and paint just like an artist it's a good ally 
it's become an art form a form of sculpture 
but even more importantly he created a language a way we could communicate a code of dots dashes and arrows 
this is an origami figure -- one sheet no cuts folding only hundreds of folds 
this too is origami and this shows where we've gone in the modern world 
you can get horns antlers -- even if you look close cloven hooves 
and what changed is something you might not have expected in an art which is math 
i mean a stag beetle -- it's got two points for jaws it's got antennae can you be that specific in the detail 
if i make the flaps skinnier i can use a bit less paper 
and i can use those patterns now to create origami shapes 
do a little more complicated instrument 
and he used it to design this solar array 
the telescope going up in space it unfolds in two places 
the design called for geosynchronous orbit 25000 miles up 100-meter diameter lens 
and rockets are small so you have to make it smaller 
but this pattern's not going to work to get something 100 meters down to a few meters 
and they want to do their design by simulation 
and as weird and surprising as it may sound origami may someday even save a life 
now ecstasy in greek meant simply to stand to the side of something 
you can't understand more than two people talking to you 
and it has become a kind of a truism in the study of creativity that you can't be creating anything with less than 10 years of technical-knowledge immersion in a particular field 
whether it's mathematics or music it takes that long to be able to begin to change something in a way that it's better than what was there before 
you see that these people define success as something that helps others and at the same time makes you feel happy as you are working at it 
the other combinations of challenge and skill become progressively less optimal 
and that is the kind of challenge that we're trying to understand 
not a lot of women did 
the '20s and the '60s also come to mind 
this is really just about the facts of this economic moment that we live in 
this second set of headlines -- you can see that families and marriages are starting to shift 
and so they decided because they were intrigued by this finding to do a nationwide survey 
so they spread out all the census data and what they found the guy described to me as a shocker which is that in 1997 out of 2000 communities women young women were making more money than young men 
watch what happens to the women watch what happens to the men 
it looks like women got some power boost on a video game or like they snuck in some secret serum into their birth-control pills that lets them shoot up high 
what it's about is that the economy has changed a lot 
so that's childcare elder care and food preparation 
and some people say it's because in 9th grade boys start dropping out of school 
basically the way they said it to me is that they would be working 18 hours a day that their husband would maybe have a job but that mostly he would be at home taking care of the kiddies 
and this was kind of a shocker to me 
they basically enshrined the second-class status of women in the civil code 
for one thing it puts men and women in a really antagonistic relationship with one another because the men are these devious tricksters up there who've put up this glass ceiling 
so the image that i like to think of instead of glass ceiling is the high bridge 
there's no man or woman standing in the middle about to cut the cables 
to the dismay of my mother this is dangerous teenage fashion right there 
really make a fully integrated product something beautiful 
this baby is fully electric 
all the projections [say that] this one [billion] will [only] grow with one to two or three percent 
[but this second] grows with seven eight percent and then they will end up here 
they will start flying 
because we already have this [growth] in process 
the year is 1960 
can you see as the years pass by child survival is increasing 
it's only by child survival that we will stop population growth 
in the front you see actually joe murray getting the patient ready for the transplant while in the back room you see hartwell harrison the chief of urology at harvard actually harvesting the kidney 
that really has to do with our aging population 
it's not really that foreign of a concept actually it happens on the earth every day 
so your body is constantly regenerating 
so how can we harness that power 
that's exactly what you see here 
to the naked eye they look like a piece of your blouse or your shirt but actually these materials are fairly complex and they are designed to degrade once inside the body 
it disintegrates a few months later 
what about other structures 
this is actually an engineered blood vessel 
you now have your fully seeded scaffold 
we then take a scaffold that we shape like a bladder 
we place it back into this oven-like device 
so bladders are definitely a little bit more complex than the other structures 
but there are other hollow organs that have added complexity to it 
we exercise these prior to implantation 
all we are left with is the skeleton if you will of the liver all made up of collagen a material that's in our bodies that will not reject 
this is still experimental but we are able to actually reproduce the functionality of the liver structure experimentally 
so another strategy we're following is actually to create wafers that we stack together like an accordion if you will 
if at all possible we really would like to use smart biomaterials that we can just take off the shelf and regenerate your organs 
why because we'd rather take those cells which already know that those are the cell types you want 
and we prefer cells that will not reject and will not form tumors 
and we're working a lot with the stem cells that we published on two years ago stem cells from the amniotic fluid and the placenta which have those properties 
so i always like to show this cartoon 
and there you see the stagecoach driver and he goes on the top panel he goes a b c d e f 
entrepreneurs are people -- because we have a lot of them in this room -- who have these ideas and these passions or see these needs in the world and we decide to stand up and do it 
and as a young kid nobody can say it can't happen because you're too dumb to realize that you couldn't figure it out 
if we can teach our kids to become entrepreneurial -- the ones that show those traits to be -- like we teach the ones who have science gifts to go on in science what if we saw the ones who had entrepreneurial traits and taught them to be entrepreneurs 
we could actually have all these kids spreading businesses instead of waiting for government handouts 
and the media says that it's really cool if we could go out and be a model or a singer or a sports hero like luongo crosby 
our mba programs do not teach kids to be entrepreneurs 
we didn't fit in the normal work we couldn't work for somebody else because we're too stubborn and we have all these other traits 
i could go on and on 
fit into this other system and try to become a student 
i'm also quoted -- and i told the person who wrote the textbook -- i'm now quoted in that exact same university textbook in every canadian university and college studies 
i open up chapter eight talking about budgeting 
and i told the author after they did my interview that i cheated in that same course 
and my mom came into the room and she said where are you going to get the coat hangers to sell to the dry cleaners 
i'm like but you have two cars and they don't have license plate protectors 
so i knew there were two cars with two license plates on each 
but it was obvious to me right buy low sell high 
don't try to sell to the poor kids they don't have cash the rich people do go get some 
so that's obvious right 
and making money off that too 
i built these little pincushions when i was 11 years old in cubs and we made these pin cushions for our moms for mother's day 
and you'd make these chairs 
you get the golf balls and you just throw them in your bathing suit trunks and when you're done you've got a couple hundred of them 
and they could use those for practice balls 
but it paid the bills 
i remember being told to walk out in the middle of a street in banff alberta because i'd thrown a penny out in the street and my dad said go pick it up 
but then we negotiate on what they're going to get paid 
you breed that kind of stuff each of my kids has two piggy banks 
the 50 percent that goes in their house account every six months goes to the bank 
just do that kind of stuff and have fun with it 
we have all these lessons in front of us but we don't take those opportunities we teach kids to go get a tutor 
my kids love this stuff 
it's a video that was done by one of the companies that i mentor 
they were trying to figure out how to rebuild their universities 
since education under the soviet union was essentially propaganda serving the purposes of a state ideology they appreciated that it would take wholesale transformations if they were to provide an education worthy of free men and women 
you may think you know what is going on in that jane austen novel -- that is until your first encounter with postmodern deconstructionism 
when the astronomical distance between the realities of the academy and the visionary intensity of this challenge were more than enough i can assure you to give one pause what was happening outside higher education made backing off unthinkable 
and that was only the beginning 
incredibly this nation with all its material intellectual and spiritual resources seems utterly helpless to reverse the freefall in any of these areas 
we are playing with fire 
on a more personal note this betrayal of our principles our decency our hope made it impossible for me to avoid the question what will i say years from now when people ask 'where were you' as president of a leading liberal arts college famous for its innovative history there were no excuses 
the challenge to figure out what it will take to actually do something that makes a significant and sustainable difference 
even more valuable history provides a laboratory in which we see played out the actual as well as the intended consequences of ideas 
students in turn continuously move outside the classroom to engage the world directly 
this is a political education to be sure 
the center will embody and sustain this new educational commitment 
what is certain is that the individual talent exhibited in such abundance here needs to turn its attention to that collaborative messy frustrating contentious and impossible world of politics and public policy 
all right okay so  perfect 
they go to church by which i mean they do lots of things for free for each other 
now i know you don't believe me really here 
he's a terrible producer of videos but it's great content so i'm going to give you a little bit of it 
so here he is beginning 
this is this fantastic brat pack remix set to lisztomania 
they decided they wanted to do the same 
so that's importantly different from the earlier videos we looked at because here remix isn't just about an individual doing something alone in his basement it becomes an act of social creativity 
indeed mickey mouse himself of course as steamboat willie is a remix of the then very dominant very popular steamboat bill by buster keaton 
he is the celebration and ideal of exactly this kind of creativity 
but then the company passes through this dark stage to this democrat 
okay for a second example think about this cultural hero icon on the left creator of this character 
look at the site that he built star wars mashups inviting people to come and use their creative energy to produce a new generation of attention towards this extraordinarily important cultural icon 
so the point is the republicans here recognize that there's a certain need of ownership a respect for ownership the respect we should give the creator the remixer the owner the property owner the copyright owner of this extraordinarily powerful stuff and not a generation of sharecroppers 
now i think there are lessons we should learn here lessons about openness 
our lives are sharing activities at least in part 
that's number one number two this ecology of sharing needs freedom within which to create 
and number three we need to respect the creator the creator of these remixes through rights that are directly tied to them 
these tools that we built enable this sharing in parts through licenses that make it clear and a freedom to create without requiring permission first because the permission has already been granted and a respect for the creator because it builds upon a copyright the creator has licensed freely 
and it explains the vast right-wing conspiracy that's obviously developed around these licenses as now more than 350 million digital objects are out there licensed freely in this way 
now if we can learn those values from at least some influences on the right if we can take them and incorporate them maybe we could do a little trade 
in fact someone on reddit thought oh what a great thing we should all vote this up 
and that was that the internet loves mister splashy pants 
they even created an e-card so you could send your friend a dancing splashy 
there are so many great publishing tools that are available it only takes a few minutes of your time now to actually produce something 
if you want to succeed you've got to be okay to just lose control 
well we all know the world wide web has absolutely transformed publishing broadcasting commerce and social connectivity but where did it all come from 
vannevar bush was the us government's chief scientific adviser during the war 
and the memex would link information one piece of information to a related piece of information and so forth 
he built a system 
and we delivered the world's first hypertext system 
they had a 12-page supplement in the wall street journal the day it launched 
i thought well you know interesting but a guy from cern he's not going to do this 
in 1992 his paper was rejected for the hypertext conference 
secondly for the first time in the modern era the dominant country in the world -- which i think is what china will become -- will be not from the west and from very very different civilizational roots 
now i know it's a widespread assumption in the west that as countries modernize they also westernize 
it will remain in very fundamental respects very different 
in other words china unlike the western states and most countries in the world is shaped by its sense of civilization its existence as a civilization-state rather than as a nation-state 
well basically the east was swallowed by the west 
hence their attitude for example to the uyghurs and to the tibetans 
this is the chinese view of the state -- very very different to ours 
know that china believes in the market and the state 
moreover this is a very old state tradition a very old tradition of statecraft 
and yet we still insist by and large in thinking that we can understand china by simply drawing on western experience looking at it through western eyes using western concepts 
but it's not 
whereas those cultures -- virtually the rest of the world in fact which have been in a far weaker position vis-a-vis the west -- have been thereby forced to understand the west because of the west's presence in those societies 
because what's happening back to that chart at the beginning the goldman sachs chart 
europe was not at the final negotiating table 
well maybe that's true maybe that's an exaggeration 
but there's another problem which goes along with this -- that europe is increasingly out of touch with the world -- and that is a sort of loss of a sense of the future 
or take this now this is an idea but it's an idea to be tried out shortly in a suburb of beijing 
accelerometers on each hand read hand position 
and he was very impressed he was all tearing up ready to hug me 
i must have done about 30000 caricatures 
that evening i came home to hundreds of hate mails hundreds of people telling me how they could have lived another day without seeing this 
i was also asked to leave the organization a cartoonists' organization in america that for me was my lifeline 
and all of a sudden my paintings came alive 
the collaborative effort was fabulous 
since i mentioned my wife the most important collaboration has been with her netra 
i must have been 19 and a half then and it was love at first sight 
i lived in india she lived in america 
notice one thing we're equal here 
we had fashion designers installation artists models we had makeup artists jewelry designers all kinds of people working with me to make my wedding an art installation 
and i had a special installation in tribute to my in-laws 
i could not live this larger than life person 
this time i said let's try something different 
and this was just eight months ago 
i walk into her room and there was a shy girl and she was bald and she was trying to hide her baldness 
i whipped out my pen and i started drawing on her head and i drew a crown for her 
our computers our systems will be as primitive as the apollo's are for today 
we can develop any part of the body 
the other major development is going to be in the area of what can happen in genetics 
this would imply a massive leap in migration 
an individual for the first time in the history of humanity will have the capacity by 2030 to destroy the planet to wreck everything through the creation for example of a biopathogen 
more people smaller spaces less stuff 
for example i want to use zipcar 
and so from a branding perspective they got a lot right 
platforms are invitations 
so creating craigslist or itunes and the iphone developer network there are all these networks -- facebook as well 
essentially there are all sorts of restaurants in oakland near where i live 
and one quick example is velib in 2007 came forward in paris with a very bold proposition a very big bike-sharing service 
we're at the very beginning of something that what we're seeing and the way that mesh companies are coming forward is inviting it's engaging but it's very early 
you have to make a wish to save the world 
i mean i can't save the world nobody can 
i know those guys 
it was the only one i had at that time 
they were making scary faces to play the caricature of themselves 
so we decided to take portraits of palestinians and israelis doing the same jobs -- taxi-driver lawyer cooks 
the experts said no way 
we said okay let's try and push as far as we can 
okay for example that's palestine 
three kids -- that was three students -- were [detained] by the army because they were not carrying their papers 
we need culture out there 
you see that enough in the media 
what i want to show is the incredible life 
during that time you haven't thought about what you're going to eat tomorrow 
when you look at kibera now they look back 
so we could just walk in the street during the next days and the photos would get revealed by themselves 
so we didn't get caught this time 
hopefully you'll see the film and you'll understand the scope of the project and what the people felt when they saw those photos 
because that's a big part of it there's layers behind each photo 
but tell me advertising for what 
the people i photograph were proud to participate in the project and to have their photo in the community 
the importance is what you do with the images the statement it makes where it's pasted 
this image of three men wearing gas masks was taken in chernobyl originally and i pasted it in southern italy where the mafia sometimes bury the garbage under the ground 
so a subject you're passionate about a person who you want to tell their story or even your own photos -- tell me what you stand for 
einstein's especially interested in penelope's talk 
a lot of her research goes on in caves which can get pretty dusty 
well that's really cool but what einstein's really hoping is that maybe he'll genetically engineer a five-pound peanut 
that is one big peanut since einstein is a bird she's very interested in things that fly 
e [spaceship noise] sw even if it doesn't have a laser 
e [squawks] sw yeah it sure can but when einstein needs to relax from her job educating the public she loves to take in the arts 
or maybe sirena huang would like to learn some arias on her violin and einstein can sing along with some opera 
e [operatic squawk] sw very good 
or maybe stu just needs another backup singer 
you like to drink water 
again 
e ooooowww 
e goodbye 
and about five years ago we asked what was the most important need for innovation in schooling here in the uk 
the minister of education down south in london described himself as a big fan 
they're not like all of you who can sit in rows and hear things said to you for hour after hour 
i would run into the living room jump up on the couch rip the cushions off throw them on the floor scream at the top of my lungs and run out because i was the incredible hulk 
and i would like to share my art 
so moving onward 
first principles this is very important 
i tried kickboards 
hand paddles everything 
kicking harder doesn't solve the problem because the average swimmer only transfers about three percent of their energy expenditure into forward motion 
so let's look at some examples this is terry 
rather he is entering the water at a 45-degree angle with his forearm and then propelling himself by streamlining -- very important 
below is what most swimmers will find enables them to do what i did which is going from 21 strokes per 20-yard length to 11 strokes in two workouts with no coach no video monitoring 
in freestyle easiest way to remedy this is to turn with body roll and just to look at your recovery hand as it enters the water 
then i transferred to a different school sophomore year and i had a choice of other languages most of my friends were taking japanese 
i couldn't believe i was on the other side of the world 
and a teacher came up to me and handed me a piece of paper 
and that's pretty much my response 
nothing worked until i found this 
many of the publications in japan limit themselves to these characters to facilitate literacy -- some are required to 
and now i love languages 
i was so concerned with her perception of what i was doing that it exploded in my face never to return to the ballroom dancing club 
everyone burst into laughter i was humiliated 
so i had a very short deadline for a competition 
these seemed to be the three areas that i could exploit to compete if i wanted to comptete against people who'd been practicing for 20 to 30 years 
that photo is of the semi-finals of the buenos aires championships four months later 
then one month later went to the world championships made it to the semi-final and then set a world record following that two weeks later 
so he can lift the woman to break her for example 
there are many different types 
i have hundreds of hours of footage -- all categorized much like george carlin categorized his comedy 
so fear is your friend fear is an indicator 
especially with fears you gained when you were a child 
and if any of you are interested in that i would love to speak with you 
but i ask a lot of questions and i would love your advice 
it's written using wiki software -- which is the type of software he just demonstrated -- so anyone can quickly edit and save and it goes live on the internet immediately 
so when yochai is talking about new methods of organization he's exactly describing wikipedia and what i'm going to do today is tell you a little bit more about how it really works on the inside 
and so if you think about what that means it means a lot more than just building a cool website 
and so that's a big part of why we've chosen the free licensing model because that empowers local entrepreneurs -- or anyone who wants to can take our content and do anything they like with it -- you can copy it redistribute it and you can do it commercially or non-commercially 
the biggest languages are german japanese french -- all the western european languages are quite big 
so the big question when you've got this really chaotic organization is why isn't it all rubbish why is the website as good as it is 
the actual truth about the specific bush-kerry incident is that the bush-kerry articles were locked less than one percent of the time in 2004 and it wasn't because they were contentious it was just because there was routine vandalism -- which happens sometimes even on stage people -- sometimes even reporters have reported to me that they vandalize wikipedia and were amazed that it was fixed so quickly 
so the biggest and the most important thing is our neutral point-of-view policy 
if you engage in that type of behavior you'll be asked to leave the community 
and then users can set up their own personal watch list 
so my page is on quite a few volunteers' watch lists because it is sometimes vandalized 
and that's a really important thing to understand is that the vast majority of the edits that go on on the website are from a very close-knit community of maybe 600 to 1000 people who are in constant communication 
another thing that we do within the community is we leave everything very open-ended 
i give this talk sometimes with angela who was just re-elected to the board from the community -- to the board of the foundation with more than twice the votes of the person who didn't make it 
of course the vote ended up being about 85 to 18 so there was no real danger to our democratic processes 
it strikes me that much of the textbooks that are used to educate our children are inherently biased 
have you found wikipedia being used by teachers and how do you see wikipedia changing education 
it builds on the storyline of bloggers versus newspapers 
i sent it from my harvard email address because i was recently appointed a fellow there 
and so the wiki books project is an effort to do that 
in the jungles of guatemala in tikal stands a temple 
his name was jasaw chan k'awiil 
he lived into his 80s and he was buried beneath this monument in 720 ad 
they've never found a society that did not have it 
it was told by an anonymous kwakiutl indian of southern alaska to a missionary in 1896 and here it is 
it's below your emotions 
it comes from a david mamet play and there's two con artists in the play and the woman is conning the man and the man looks at the woman and says oh you're a bad pony i'm not going to bet on you 
so what have i learned from this experiment that i would like to tell the world 
too old too young too scruffy too stupid and they won't do it 
and in fact sometimes i feel a little sorry for the chicken on my dinner plate when i think of how intense this brain system is 
and so i've spent the last three years on this 
and so there's one thing that makes me pursue my understanding of human nature and this reminds me of it

so this is called tembererana 
it's based on an argentinian rhythm called carnivalito 
yves uses his body to steer the wing 
commentator there's that 90 degree turn you're talking about taking him out 
and his equipment as well 
how did you start to become jetman 
and that's the nearest thing to the dream 
when i exit full of kerosene i'm about 55 kilos 
for example last winter i began with kite surfing -- so new things 
because this is -- i'm quite an experienced manager of systems as a pilot but this is really -- you need fluidity you need to be agile and also to adapt really fast 
so i was at my minimum altitude in that vector -- fast -- so i pulled that 
exactly there is a rescue parachute for the wing for two reasons so i can repair it afterward and especially so nobody takes that just on his head 
this is risky stuff indeed 
i assume you have standards 
let's not tell you employer 
have you ever seen tandem birds 
it seems a little bit crazy but it's not 
thanks to the increasing technology better technology it will be safe 
they wished they knew how to prevent their food supply from sometimes failing and how they could rest when they were tired without risking starvation be warmer cooler safer in less pain 
but they failed almost completely to make any 
discoveries like fire happened so rarely that from an individual's point of view the world never improved 
within 40 years physicists discovered the whole explanation expressed as usual in elegant symbols 
but that ability to make progress remained almost unused until the event that revolutionized the human condition and changed the universe 
but that can't be what made the difference 
and that rarely if ever caused anything like the scientific revolution 
at the time what they thought distinguished science was a radical idea about things unseen known as empiricism 
in what language certainly not the language of mathematics in which galileo rightly said the book of nature is written 
by the way why don't we do that 
we don't see those nuclear reactions in stars 
some rocks and some finches 
what we see in all these cases bears no resemblance to the reality that we conclude is responsible -- only a long chain of theoretical reasoning and interpretation connects them 
that myth is testable 
it's equally testable 
the search for hard-to-vary explanations is the origin of all progress 
one is well known untestable theories

the problem is there aren't enough eye care professionals in the world to use the model of the delivery of corrective eyewear that we have in the developed world 
there are just way too few eye care professionals 
so i've now made eye glasses to my prescription

but this glacier caved into the water and a seal got on it 
they're going to get to land 
but unfortunately 95 percent of the glaciers in the arctic are also receding right now to the point that the ice is ending up on land and not injecting any ice back into the ecosystem 
these ringed seals also live out their entire life cycle associated and connected to sea ice 
here's me in my office 
after an hour in these conditions it's so extreme that when i go down almost every dive i vomit into my regulator because my body can't deal with the stress of the cold on my head 
i get to hand my camera to my assistant and i'm looking up at him and i'm going woo woo woo 
it could have survived 150 years of whaling 
when i'm on my deathbed i'm going to remember one story more than any other 
as a species as humans we like to say penguins are really cute therefore leopard seals eat them so leopard seals are ugly and bad 
it just sees this big balloon in the ocean -- it doesn't have hands -- it's going to take a little bite the boat pops and off they go 
i'm with my swedish assistant and guide 
it's time for you to get in the water 
why else would she release these penguins at me 
because she can't believe i can't eat this penguin 
she's about to let me know she's too frustrated with me 
what had happened was another seal had snuck in behind me and she did that to threat display 
and i'm so passionate about it 
they go to see michelangelo's david and when they finally come face to face with the statue they both freeze dead in their tracks 
if you know about this trait you can understand a lot of puzzles about human behavior 
when the liberal team loses as it did in 2004 and as it almost did in 2000 we comfort ourselves 
developmental psychology has shown that kids come into the world already knowing so much about the physical and social worlds and programmed to make it really easy for them to learn certain things and hard to learn others 
here are the results 
so as you see people care about harm and care issues 
you picked a particular breed you learned some new information about the breed 
in the first panel we see the moment of creation 
it shoots up and it keeps going up 
i think that's probably right although this is a controversial issue 
it's just a lot of rock and then a lot of water and wind and a lot of time and you get the grand canyon 
so liberals speak for the weak and oppressed 
you have the markings of shiva on the right shiva's the liberal god and they work together 
but as we learned from samantha power in her story about sergio vieira de mello you can't just go charging in saying you're wrong and i'm right 
if australia had to send a thousand people tomorrow to west papua for example we don't have a thousand police officers hanging around that could just go tomorrow and we do have a thousand soldiers that could go 
so when we have to send someone we send the military -- because they're there they're available and heck they're used to going off and doing these things and living by themselves and not having all this extra support 
one particular thing that's come up that i am especially interested in is the question of whether when we're sending military personnel to do these sorts of jobs we ought to be equipping them differently and in particular whether we ought to be giving them access to some of the sorts of non-lethal weapons that police have 
military personnel are being trained for war so they're trained that as soon as things go bad their first response is lethal force 
and of course being australian i started looking at stuff in australia knowing again from my own experience about various times when non-lethal weapons have been introduced in australia 
this is something they can use instead of a firearm in those situations where they would have previously had to shoot someone 
this was something explicitly introduced to be an alternative to firearms but it's being routinely used to deal with a whole range of other sorts of problems 
now one of the particular issues that comes up with military use of non-lethal weapons -- and people when they're actually saying well hey there might be some problems -- there's a couple of particular problems that get focused on 
you have to be careful about who you're shooting at 
they were holding something like 700 people hostage 
and it's no surprise that people died because you don't know how much of this gas each person is going to inhale what position they're going to fall in when they become unconscious and so on 
the person who's spraying the oc spray is wearing a rubber glove to make sure they don't get contaminated and so on 
just in case you think it's only going to happen in the united states it happened in canada as well 
and a colleague of mine sent me this one from london 
i looked at it i was really surprised 
so if you have these problems with police officers with non-lethal weapons what on earth would make you think it's going to be better with military personnel 
what would these guys have done if they'd had access to tasers or to a manned portable version of the active denial system -- a small heat ray that you can use on people and not worry about it 
and here he'll explain a little bit about what it does 
and i found this old video 
with our strengths and our minds and spirit we gather we form and we fashion 
this particular reel -- it's an industrial video -- but it was shown in drive-in theaters in 1961 -- in the detroit area in fact -- and it preceded alfred hitchcock's psycho 
and when i sat down next to him he was telling me about a company he formed and he was building some robots for automobile factories to move things around on the factory floor 
now the other thing that i think is taking off another reason making is taking off today is there's some great new tools out there 
so they're the brains of maker projects and here's an example of one 
these guys came up with a kit version for 750 dollars and that means that hobbyists and ordinary folks can get a hold of this and begin playing with 3d printers 
isn't that cool 
well he did a little bit better than free 
so we all think we know what glamour is here it is 
it's glamorous movie stars like marlene dietrich 
fantastic glamorous pictures of steel mills and paper mills and all kinds of glamorous industrial places 
you had a glamour 
there is a process of idealization glorification and dramatization and it's not just the case for people 
glamour doesn't have to be people 
it puts you into this special special world 
she's not looking away from you exactly but you have to mentally imagine her world 
she's encouraging you to contemplate this higher world to which she belongs where she can be completely tranquil while holding the iron instruments of her death by torture 
this sort of streamlining styling is not just glamorous because we associate it with movies of that period but because in it's streamlining it transports us from the everyday 
to conceal all art and make whatever is done or said appear to be without effort and this is one of the critical aspects of glamour 
but if you look in a catalog -- particularly a catalog of modern beautiful objects for your home -- it looks like this 
part of the thing is that in rear window the question is is she too glamorous to live in his world 
and the answer is no but of course it's really just a movie 
so this session's supposed to be about pure pleasure but glamour's really partly about meaning 
the perfect love life -- symbolized by the perfect necklace the perfect diamond ring 
this is an interior design firm that is literally called utopia 
but there's a kind of wonder in the stuff that gets edited away in the cords of life 
david hockney talks about how the appreciation of this very glamorous painting is heightened if you think about the fact that it takes two weeks to paint this splash which only took a fraction of a second to happen 
but i also knew how hard they worked all week 
but as a scientist i'm interested in a different problem of other minds and that is the one i'm going to introduce to you today 
and then finally to show that some of the differences between people in how we judge others can be explained by differences in this brain system 
child what rs pirates really like cheese sandwiches 
this pirate is called joshua 
now i'm going to show you a three-year-old who got the same puzzle 
so the three-year-old does two things differently 
and second when he sees ivan taking the sandwich where he left his where we would say he's taking that one because he thinks it's his the three-year-old comes up with another explanation he's not taking his own sandwich because he doesn't want it because now it's dirty on the ground 
so that's why he's taking the other sandwich 
and we can see the continuation of this process of learning to think about other people's thoughts by upping the ante and asking children now not for an action prediction but for a moral judgment 
remember the five-year-old completely understood why ivan took joshua's sandwich 
was ivan being mean and naughty for taking joshua's sandwich 
he says the wind should get in trouble for switching the sandwiches 
and so what we wanted to know was could differences among adults in how they think about other people's thoughts be explained in terms of differences in this brain region 
and her friend drinks the coffee and is fine 
and what you can see is on the left when there was very little activity in this brain region people paid little attention to her innocent belief and said she deserved a lot of blame for the accident 
first i'm going to show you that this is a magnetic pulse 
i'm going to show you what happens when you put a quarter on the machine 
but in the case of a failed attempt to harm where grace thought that it was poison although it was really sugar people now say it was more okay she deserves less blame for putting the powder in the coffee 
so it's not a surreptitious technology 
so i've got one last question there is this thing called the hard problem of consciousness that puzzles a lot of people 
why 
me was composed of stories of cravings of strivings of desires of the future 
me only existed in the trying 
babies actually don't come out of your mouth 
i would drive it and demand things from it 
i didn't heed it no i organized it and i directed it 
i took more than my body had to offer 
cancer exploded the wall of my disconnection 
now i am swimming in it 
so we brought her home and i prayed that the oil wouldn't wash up on her beach before she died 
and i said but what's the water part 
it was my whole self melting into michaela's lap 
it was finding my place and the huge responsibility that comes with connection 
it was energy love and joy 
it was all these things 
because everyone these days wants to know how to slow down but they want to know how to slow down really quickly so  
so i was in new york recently and i walked past a gym that had an advertisement in the window for a new course a new evening course 
you know a burnout or eventually the body says i can't take it anymore and throws in the towel 
am i really in such a hurry that i'm prepared to fob off my son with a sound byte at the end of the day 
i just thought and i thought long and hard 
and by the time i got off that plane i'd decided i wanted to do something about it 
time is scarce so what do we do 
and i guess that the question is is it possible to break free from that mindset 
and in this kind of cauldron of moments and places and acts of deceleration lie what a lot of people now refer to as the international slow movement 
you know you tap into that -- those deeper sort of psychological emotional spiritual currents and you get a better orgasm with the buildup 
i mean you heard that i got a speeding ticket while i was researching my book on the benefits of slowness and that's true but that's not all of it 
i think there's a kind of metaphysical dimension -- that speed becomes a way of walling ourselves off from the bigger deeper questions 
we fill our head with distraction with busyness so that we don't have to ask am i well am i happy are my children growing up right 
it's become my reward at the end of the day something i really cherish 
i was downstairs by the front door and i was waiting for a taxi and my son came down the stairs and he'd made a card for me and he was carrying it 
so what i'd like to talk about is something that was very dear to kahn's heart which is how do we discover what is really particular about a project 
this used to be an island -- ackerman island -- and we filled in the channel during the depression to create jobs 
and here's the building as it opened with a channel overlooking downtown and as seen from downtown 
every piece of the building works 
i was very moved by what i saw today 
let's get back to the town and walk to the site 
and as things are a little easier in india the site was purchased within a week and we were working 
and the structures rise from the sand cliffs -- they're built in concrete and sandstones the roofs are stainless steel -- they are facing south and reflecting light towards the temple itself pedestrians crisscross from one side to the other 
back to yad vashem three years ago after all this episode began yad vashem decided to rebuild completely the historic museum because now washington was built -- the holocaust museum in washington -- and that museum is so much more comprehensive in terms of information 
they said let's rebuild the museum 
and here studying in three dimensions how to give some kind again of order a structure not something you feel you could just change because you stop the design of that particular process 
i'd like to conclude by relating all of what i've said to the term beauty 
we call a natural object beautiful because we see that its form expresses fitness the perfect fulfillment of function 
nevertheless beauty as the kind of fit something that tells us that all the forces that have to do with our natural environment have been fulfilled -- and our human environment -- for that 
he who seeks truth shall find beauty he who seeks beauty shall find vanity 
he who considers himself the servant of his fellow beings shall find the joy of self-expression he who seeks self-expression shall fall into the pit of arrogance 
my name is kailash and i like to enrich lives through technicolored glass 
a rising tide lifts all boats 
it felt like it was really important 
i just really wanted to acknowledge you 
it is really a sacred space 
see these all lie right inside of this general emotional palette that we were painting 
the only way that i would say it was a mistake is in that we didn't react to it 
it was an opportunity that was missed 
so it's just a season and there are two seasons in most of south asia 
high pressure builds over india 
a few kilometers maybe is quite typical 
and this is called the globe skimmer or wandering glider 
but it really hasn't been studied very much 
it's a rather mediocre looking dragonfly 
if you're going to study dragonflies you want to study those really bright beautiful ones like that red one or the really rare ones the endemic endangered ones 
and they were there for some time and then they were gone 
and i didn't think anything more of it until the following year when it happened again and then the year after that and then the year after that 
and on top of the coral reefs are sand banks 
those of you who are indian or spent your childhood here let me have a show of hands who of you -- not yet not yet 
so are these things how are these things getting here 
it stretches about 500 miles of course it's india here 
when do you see the dragonflies appear 
and then the southernmost maldives 
so i started a very rigorous scientific process 
it doesn't make sense there is nothing for them in maldives 
and we're starting in june so this is the monsoon rain 
nothing for these dragonflies there is no more seasonal rain 
they're looking for somewhere to breed if it rains here they'll breed 
they'll hatch out in six weeks by that time the seasonal rains have moved on it's not there it's down here 
they'll fly down here and the clever thing is the wind is always converging to where the rain is 
so the little fellow that hatches out here he gets up into the air he is automatically carried to where the rain is falling 
so in four generations one two three four and then back 
a complete circuit of the indian ocean 
there is more to the story 
which is an area along the amur river which is up here 
he's an engineer 
half as much money was spent on this norden bombsight as was spent on the most famous military-industrial project of the modern era 
it allowed you to bomb only those things that you absolutely needed and wanted to bomb 
and it's carried in a box with a canvas shroud over it 
it's never allowed to be photographed 
there are clouds right 
the leuna chemical plant after one of the most extensive bombings in the history of the war was up and running within weeks 
so i would like to invite you also for a while to the himalayas themselves 
and to show the place where meditators like me who began with being a molecular biologist in pasteur institute and found their way to the mountains 
i just wrote an essay on happiness and there was a controversy 
as pascal said even the one who hangs himself somehow is looking for cessation of suffering -- he finds no other way 
although we want to avoid suffering it seems we are running somewhat towards it 
and that can also come from some kind of confusions 
it is something that -- changes of nature 
it is a deep sense of serenity and fulfillment a state that actually pervades and underlies all emotional states and all the joys and sorrows that can come one's way 
can we have this kind of well-being while being sad in a way why not 
but there's also wicked joy you can rejoice in someone's suffering 
we know by experience that we can be what we call a little paradise and yet be completely unhappy within 
the experience that translates everything is within the mind 
we have to know from ourselves there are certain states of mind that are conducive to this flourishing to this well-being what the greeks called eudaimonia flourishing 
just the mere fact of doing that fills such a sense of adequation with our deep nature 
for that we have to ask what is nature of mind 
and if we look from the experiential point of view there is a primary quality of consciousness that's just the mere fact to be cognitive to be aware 
usually when we feel annoyed hatred or upset with someone or obsessed with something the mind goes again and again to that object 
but we think we could sit on the cloud -- but if you go there it's just mist 
mind transformation -- that is the very meaning of meditation 
so that's what those great meditators have been doing 
if you are happy about something you'll go more to the left side 
here the -05 is the full standard deviation of a meditator who meditated on compassion 
so i've no time to go into all the different scientific results 
some meditators without trying to stop it but simply by being completely open thinking that that bang is just going to be just a small event like a shooting star they are able not to move at all 
so the whole point of that is not sort of to make like a circus thing of showing exceptional beings who can jump or whatever 
we are ready to spend 15 years achieving education 
i'm not going to show you a presentation i'm going to talk to you 
the thing that was always striking to me was that we as people could have so many really amazing ideas about things we'd like to do but are so often unable in the real world to actually do those things -- to actually cobble together the materials and go through the actual execution phase of building something that you imagine from a design perspective 
it's going to be different than here 
to give you an idea of scale second life is about 20000 cpus at this point 
and let me justify that with two statements 
and i think that's something that people have talked about for 20 years -- you know that 3d that lifelike environments are really important in some magical way to us 
second life originally had 16 simulators it now has 20000 
and we had -- we zoned it you know we put a nightclub we put a disco where you could dance and then we had a place where you could fight with guns if you wanted to and we had another place that was like a boardwalk kind of a coney island 
and so the existence of an economy is critical 
the question is there appears to be a lack of cultural fine-tuning in second life 
and so the multicultural nature and the sort of cultural melting pot that's happening inside second life is quite -- i think quite remarkable relative to what in real human terms in the real world we've ever been able to achieve 
other questions right here 
what's your demographic 
in terms of psychographic -- oh men and women men and women are almost equally matched in second life so about 45 percent of the people online right now on second life are women 
in terms of psychographic you know the people in second life are remarkably dissimilar relative to what you might think when you go in and talk to them and meet them and i would you know challenge you to just do this and find out 
if you count yeah cities so -- but i did -- and i didn't do -- i think i didn't do as well in school as i could have i think you're right 
yeah so let me restate that 
so you're saying that in the pamphlet there's a statement that we may come to prefer our digital selves to our real ones -- our more malleable or manageable digital identities to our real identities -- and that in fact much of human life and human experience may move into the digital realm 
that's a frightening change frightening disruption 
i guess and you're asking what do i think about that how do i -- jh what's your response to the people who would say that's horrifying 
(audience if someone would say to you i find that disturbing what would be your response) pr well i'd say a couple of things 
now the problem of human diversity like all big scientific questions -- how do you explain something like that -- can be broken down into sub-questions 
what we're asking about though is human ancestry 
digging things up out of the ground and largely on the basis of morphology -- the way things are shaped often skull shape -- saying this looks a little bit more like us than that so this must be my ancestor 
you think you've got a tough job 
now a quick primer on dna 
mitochondrial dna tracing a purely maternal line of descent 
turn them on their sides combine them so that they look like a tree with the root at the bottom and the branches going up 
was it millions of years ago which we might suspect by looking at all this incredible variation around the world 
why was it that we seem to have come out of africa so recently 
what was going on to the world's weather around 60000 years ago 
the reason for that is that ice actually sucks moisture out of the atmosphere 
now at the risk of offending any paleoanthropologists or physical anthropologists in the audience basically there's not a lot of change between these two stone tool groups 
well you want the ultimate african success story 
look in the mirror you're it the reason you're alive today is because of those changes in our brains that took place in africa -- probably somewhere in the region where we're sitting right now around 60 70 thousand years ago -- allowing us not only to survive in africa but to expand out of africa 
these would have been savannah hunters 
entering europe around 35000 years ago and finally a small group migrating up through the worst weather imaginable siberia inside the arctic circle during the last ice age -- temperature was at -70 -80 even -100 perhaps -- migrating into the americas ultimately reaching that final frontier 
the changes that allowed us to do that the evolution of this highly adaptable brain that we all carry around with us allowing us to create novel cultures allowing us to develop the diversity that we see on a whirlwind trip like the one i've just been on 
the field research that we're doing around the world with indigenous peoples 
the human genome project or a mars rover mission 
in this case you actually can 
and you'll now see the yolk and the white have separated 
and we all know in our heart of hearts that this is not the way the universe works 
and yet look around us 
now we move forward 380000 years 
but that's not completely true 
recent studies by satellites such as the wmap satellite have shown that in fact there are just tiny differences in that background 
we have our first stars 
so we've crossed a fourth threshold of complexity 
so it copies itself and scatters the templates through the ocean 
and that's why as a species we're so creative and so powerful and that's why we have a history 
and then from about 500 years ago humans began to link up globally through shipping through trains through telegraph through the internet until now we seem to form a single global brain of almost seven billion individuals 
we've been on a journey a return journey of 137 billion years 
and it's a story in which humans play an astonishing and creative role 
collective learning is a very very powerful force and it's not clear that we humans are in charge of it 
the program in a sense is an example of behavioral finance on steroids -- how we could really use behavioral finance 
how many of you have iphones 
and that's what i really want to focus on today 
and what i'm going to talk about today is save more tomorrow 
first thing to notice is half of them do not even have access to a 401 plan 
and they get overwhelmed and the just don't join 
suppose we had another wonderful ted event next week 
the same people that imagined themselves eating the bananas ended up eating chocolates a week later 
self-control is not a problem in the future 
nobody checks boxes 
we're going to talk about what happens if people are overwhelmed and scared to make their 401 choices 
they're really mad 
we first implemented it richard thaler and i back in 1998 
we invited them to save three percentage points more every time they get a pay raise 
we're seeing here a three and a half-year period four pay raises people who were struggling to save were saving three percent of their paycheck three and a half years later saving almost four times as much almost 14 percent 
it's been part of the pension protection act 
the average household spends $4000 a year on lottery tickets

this song is called fingertips 
this is eleanor roosevelt 
well i think we're going to stop that part of the show 
here's a song we like to think of as the future anthem of ted 
and the third said let's find another director 
so how many people who saw the film did not get that here was a woman in love that she was completely innocent and saw great joy in her life and she was youthful 
and how many of you did not get that 
it's a symbolic gesture i tear up the script i go and i panic myself i get scared 
get rid of your mind 
in delhi we used to live -- we used to call it a chhat or the khota 
and i don't know why but i remember the story 
there was a woodcutter who's about to take his ax and chop a piece of wood and the whole galaxy is one atom of that ax 
and when that ax hits that piece of wood that's when everything will destroy and the big bang will happen again 
but all before that there was a woodcutter 
so every time i could tell my story again and again and get over this problem and so i got over the problem 
if we do not create the stories we probably go mad 
are you with child 
you ask my permission before you rut before you breed 
elizabeth this man has seduced a ward of the queen and she has married without royal consent 
remember the word i said suck up 
but i can go on about telling you how we evolve stories and how stories effectively are who we are and how these get translated into the particular discipline that i am in which is film 
we're born for them 
the children's television host mr rogers always carried in his wallet a quote from a social worker that said frankly there isn't anyone you couldn't learn to love once you've heard their story 
and the way i like to interpret that is probably the greatest story commandment which is make me care -- please emotionally intellectually aesthetically just make me care 
and so if i were going to give you the ending of this story it would go something like this and that's what ultimately led me to speaking to you here at ted about story 
he insisted no embalming no open coffin no funeral 
it didn't happen to me it happened to somebody else but it's going to be worth your time 
♫ and that is all ♫ ♫ that love's about ♫ ♫ and we'll recall ♫ ♫ when time runs out ♫ ♫ that it only ♫  as storytelling without dialogue 
it confirmed something i really had a hunch on is that the audience actually wants to work for their meal 
and it's something that always drove all his choices 
wall-e's was to find the beauty 
sometimes you can make some horrible choices with them 
but a major threshold is passed when you mature enough to acknowledge what drives you and to take the wheel and steer it 
and that's why change is fundamental in story 
and it's interesting to see how that led us places that were actually pretty good 
and we got a hold of that fax 
and when an artist does that to another artist it's like you're compelled to pass it on 
i was going to help alleviate poverty 
we paid two to three times more than anybody else 
we may have some innovative new ideas 
there's no more of it 
this is where we stand today 
and then we need to use less again 
okay so let's be generous 
how do you evaluate all the scientific data around a product the data that's changing on a weekly if not a daily basis 
how is a consumer going to walk through this minefield 
these are the 15 commodities that fundamentally pose the biggest threats to these places because of deforestation soil loss water use pesticide use over-fishing etc 
are we going to work with 15 billion producers 
if we work with those if we change those companies and the way they do business then the rest will happen automatically 
because if these companies demand sustainable products they'll pull 40 to 50 percent of production 
by companies asking for this we can leverage production so much faster than by waiting for consumers to do it 
after 40 years the global organic movement has achieved 07 of one percent of global food 
we can't wait that long 
we need change that's going to accelerate 
so it's the demand that brings them to the table 
so we're pulling out all the stops 
they're doing it with ibm and the usda and they're putting it in the public domain because they want everybody to have access to this data because they want everybody to help them make cocoa more productive and more sustainable 
if you divide the amount of water into what the farmer was paid the farmer didn't receive enough money to pay a decent price for water in any of those commodities 
this is called bundling it's bringing those externalities back into the price of the commodity 
we can't just focus on identifying the best we've got to move the rest 
and i'm honored to meet you the future leaders of great britain and this world 
and my mother the most important role model in my life who lives with us at the white house and helps to care for our two little daughters malia and sasha 
that's why all of this that you're going through -- the ups and the downs the teachers that you love and the teachers that you don't -- why it's so important 
and having done so these women moved many obstacles 
i liked being smart 
i liked being on time i liked getting my work done 
history proves that it doesn't matter whether you come from a council estate or a country estate 
in the white house there's the desk that he sits at -- it's called the resolute desk 
she is a world-class soprano singer who studied in rochester new york 
for me the human voice is the vessel on which all emotions travel -- except perhaps jealousy 
when you're totally in the moment when i'm totally in the moment the vessel of expression is open 
the emotions can flow from me to you and back 
it's called aria 
for example there are different colors and each color gets a different type of singing -- pop country and western opera jazz -- and you just have to be consistent with that color 
they had one great limitation and one great freedom as they tried to conceive of a global network 
so unusual in fact that it was said that it's not clear the internet could work 
now of course in a mosh pit it's hard to specify a destination 
this is a system that relies on kindness and trust which also makes it very delicate and vulnerable 
so for example last year the government of pakistan asked its internet service providers there to prevent citizens of pakistan from seeing youtube 
and here is the message where one of them says looks like we've got a live one we have a hijacking of youtube 
and today wikipedia is so ubiquitous that you can now find it on chinese restaurant menus 
i am not making this up 
and there are a bunch of people who on a sunny day would rather be inside and monitoring this the administrator's notice board itself a wiki page that anyone can edit 
there are spambots crawling it trying to turn every article into an ad for a rolex watch 
it's something they feel impelled to do because they care about it 
here is just a snapshot of some of them 
if you do it will be removed immediately removed by people who may have disagreed with the original decision but respect the outcome and work to make it stay because they believe in something bigger than their own opinion 
i mean this is a 2005 business week cover 
yeah i know number four it's like can you imagine coming home to that cat everyday 
this one says bucolic meadow with split-rail fence 
and then have technology that the person taking the photo will know later this person requested to be contacted before this goes anywhere big if you don't mind 
and that person taking the photo can make a decision about how and whether to respect it 
and we now have means that we can build like this system so that people can report the filtering as they encounter it 
why there is the craigslist rideshare board 
if it were called the craigslist hitchhiking board tumbleweeds would be blowing through it 
but it's the rideshare board and it's basically the same thing 
it's a bee that yes flies 
we all live in the same planet but there's still a great deal of poverty in the world 
and by and large this has failed 
aid actually did the opposite 
so 12 years ago i was trying to be an investment banker in new york 
and it reminded me of a day in 1971 
and after all poor countries like rich countries one thing we've got equal is their days are the same length 24 hours 
the question was how much did it cost to install a new telephone in bangladesh 
it turns out 2000 dollars 
and of course if the cost of installing a telephone is going down because there's a digital revolution going on then it would be even more dramatic 
but in any event it's connectivity that leads to dependability 
there were a lot of reasons people told me why we don't have enough telephones 
the work pays them a salary the salary allows them to pay for the car over time 
the car pays for itself 
see you need some kind of infrastructure to bring a new thing 
for instance the internet was booming in the us 
and she sells the milk to the villagers and pays off the loan 
and these phones are generating about 100 million dollars for the company 
it's just an experiment 
i was a guest student during one month of a public health course 
they read the textbook twice or three times or four times 
and they were the first to twitter transatlantically 
those are nice words but i got sort of curious of what he meant with liberty and liberty for whom 
but really really natural sovereignty was good for japan 
in 1947 india finally gained its independence 
you can see that the health started to improve 
in '92 india follows with a market reform 
and they go quite closely together and you can see that the similarity with india and china in many ways are greater than the differences with them 
kerala is flying on top there matching united states in health but not in economy 
we have an enormous disparity in the world 
you see china under foreign domination actually lowered their income and came down to the indian level here 
japan did it like this until full catch up and then they follow with the other high-income economies 
can be worse can be better 
but more recently i've been turning my attention to the universe on the largest scale 
by invisible i mean it doesn't absorb in the electromagnetic spectrum 
when those measurements are made instead what we find is that the speed is basically constant as a function of distance 
in fact this galaxy and every other galaxy appears to be embedded in a cloud of this invisible dark matter 
it would be nice if we could see this dark matter a little bit more directly 
now how do we deduce where the galaxy is 
where will this observer see the galaxy 
so there's a whole ray of light -- rays of light on a cone -- that will all be bent by that cluster and make it into the observer's eye 
so actually at home whenever we break a wineglass i save the bottom take it over to the machine shop 
we shave it off and i have a little gravitational lens ok 
and we see these gravitational lensing effects these distortions that say that again clusters are embedded in dark matter 
they're moving away from each other because space itself is getting bigger ok 
so in the last century ok people debated about whether this expansion of space would continue forever whether it would slow down you know will be slowing down but continue forever slow down and stop asymptotically stop or slow down stop and then reverse so it starts to contract again 
by how much less is it expanding today compared to say a couple of billion years ago 
so we need something to be able to explain that 
but we don't know if either of those are actually the dark matter candidate ok 
they haven't seen anything ok but it puts limits on what the mass and the interaction strength of these dark matter particles are 
there's going to be a satellite telescope launched later this year and it will look towards the middle of the galaxy to see if we can see dark matter particles annihilating and producing gamma rays that could be detected with this 
now unfortunately there is a lot of new physics whose signature could be missing energy so it will be hard to tell the difference 
and finally for future endeavors there are telescopes being designed specifically to address the questions of dark matter and dark energy -- ground-based telescopes and there are three space-based telescopes that are in competition right now to be launched to investigate dark matter and dark energy 
and over the course of half an hour not one syringe was filmed being unwrapped 
they started with two and they ended with two 
in china recycling is a major issue 
and they use them in the breaks for water pistols 
and they are having great fun 
and they squirt the water into their mouths 
you load it up in the normal way this is made on existing equipment in 14 factories that we license 
imagine that orchestration 
this happens every year 
and one time he came up to me -- he was about seven or eight years old -- he came up to me 
and there was a wasp's nest that i had let grow in my yard right outside my door 
and like knock like a woodpecker on my door until i opened it up 
and i told him you know cody the wasps actually made that 
they're the people who make the bullet train 
and those bumps act like a magnet for water 
and the fog comes in and it builds up on the tips 
now it's reversing that equation and actually sequestering half a ton of co2 thanks to the recipe from the coral 
they actually export water molecules through 
and those scalloped edges play with flow in such a way that is reduces drag by 32 percent 
the question is -- biomimicry is an incredibly powerful way to innovate 
and we are in a long long line of organisms to come to this planet and ask ourselves how can we live here gracefully over the long haul 
now in order to do this the design challenge of our century i think we need a way to remind ourselves of those geniuses and to somehow meet them again 
and we're working with eol encyclopedia of life ed wilson's ted wish 
and this is a pretty well-educated audience so i imagine you all know something about aids 
if you know something more you probably know that uganda to date is the only country in sub-saharan africa that has had success in combating the epidemic 
but i'm going to use tools and ideas that are familiar to economists to think about a problem that's more traditionally part of public health and epidemiology 
we see almost no change in sexual behavior 
aids is the same kind of thing it's costly to avoid aids 
and the way that i'm going to do that is i'm going to look across areas with different levels of malaria 
and so people who live in areas with a lot of malaria are going to have lower life expectancy than people who live in areas with limited malaria 
even if you only cared about aids in africa it might still be a good idea to invest in malaria in combating poor indoor air quality in improving maternal mortality rates 
if people have no incentive to avoid aids on their own even if they know everything about the disease they still may not change their behavior 
we know they had this campaign that's how we learn about what works 
so this is another way to see this 
so i am going to talk about exports and prices 
but openness and inter-connectedness it comes with a cost when we think about disease i don't think this should be a surprise 
areas with a lot of economic activity -- with a lot of roads with a lot of urbanization -- those areas have higher prevalence than others 
and what's really really great about being here is i'm sure that the questions that you guys have are very very different than the questions that i think up myself 
it's great being here at ted 
their relationship is a love story that feeds the earth 
it reminds us that we are a part of nature and we're not separate from it 
well their answer was it's all about risk and reward 
and chip taylor our monarch butterfly expert he replied nothing lasts forever 
and that blew my mind 
we were four girls and no boys 
i don't know if he really meant [that] but it happened 
out of 100 90 are your creation 
this is about tough policing equal policing 
i now went to a prison assignment as a police officer 
here i got a prison assignment 
obviously it was 
and then how did i deal with them 
the first day when i went in i didn't know how to look at them 
i said do you pray do you want to pray 
i think that's the bigger change 
teachers were prisoners teachers were volunteers 
you want to know more about this go and see this film doing time doing vipassana 
let me wrap it up 
but the best part is the message that the yahoo help desk got about 20 minutes later 
captcha project is something that we did here at carnegie melllon over 10 years ago and it's been used everywhere 
so then i started feeling bad 
so can we get you to do useful work for those 10 seconds 
so you start with a book and then you scan it 
for example for things that were written more than 50 years ago the computer cannot recognize about 30 percent of the words 
johnedwardscom   so we keep on insulting people left and right everyday 
there are tens of thousands of these 
some of them are very cute  
and it is numbers like these that motivate my research agenda 
it hasn't yet been launched it's called duolingo 
it started with me posing a question to my graduate student severin hacker 
actually it was a forum post 
remember it's a question about javascript 
okay so computer translation not yet good enough 
we could pay professional language translators to translate the whole web 
we could do that 
if we wanted to translate the other 80 percent into spanish it would cost at least 50 million dollars -- and this is at even the most exploited outsourcing country out there 
so it would be very expensive 
for example in the united states alone there are over five million people who have paid over $500 for software to learn a new language 
there's of course a lot of very simple sentences on the web 
since all the projects that my group has worked on so far have gotten millions of users we're hopeful that we'll be able to translate extremely fast with this project 
so here's the site 
but then by the end of the decade the country had fallen back into political instability and mismanagement 
we the children had gathered at a friend's house 
i wanted to document on film the 2008 presidential elections 
and there i started by searching for the footprints in my childhood 
the polling stations opened to the voters at 700 am but voters eager to take their own political fate into their hands were starting to line up at 400 am in the morning 
they were chanting we want peace 
now the uphill battle for ghana and for africa is not over but i have proof that the other side of democracy exists and that we must not take it for granted 
that -- you know i was born thinking about things that way and i had always been like a little scientist guy 
and people in the 17th century they didn't really understand the same way we do about you know this stuff is a bunch of different kinds of molecules and we breathe it in for a purpose and all that 
and boyle said bullshit 
and so charles said i'm going to put up the money give you guys a building come here and you can meet in the building but just don't talk about religion in there 
but experimental science had been tied up with all those things 
kary mullis they might have done it for the teddy bear yeah 
i thought that anybody with any brains will do it that way 
i was thinking about making my own little rockets 
that's why i thought as long as i don't blow my eyes out  
i may not care about the fact that it's prohibited from heating this solution 
i'm sure it's got to do with rockets or it wouldn't be in that manual 
and it -- they burned 
at any rate i bring it up because it's a good story and he said tell personal things you know and that's a personal -- i was going to tell you about the first night that i met my wife but that would be too personal wouldn't it 
but in the actual process you get an idea -- like when i got the idea one night that i could amplify dna with two oligonucleotides and i could make lots of copies of some little piece of dna you know the thinking for that was about 20 minutes while i was driving my car and then instead of going -- i went back and i did talk to people about it but if i'd listened to what i heard from all my friends who were molecular biologists -- i would have abandoned it 
but i knew you'd go into the lab and you'd try to make it work yourself and then you're the authority and you can say i know it works because right there in that tube is where it happened and here on this gel there's a little band there that i know that's dna and that's the dna i wanted to amplify so there so it does work 
so you have to be honest 
now let's see  
they made bigger guns to shoot them down with 
and the people i'm talking about are people that like -- they say that they're a member of the committee called say the inter-governmental panel on climate change 
so the planet should get warmer 
so the planet is a pretty amazing thing you know it's big and horrible -- and big and wonderful and it does all kinds of things we don't know anything about 
in new york city rats are part of commuters' daily lives 
i was very fond of this space because it's the first massive industrial complex i found on my own that is abandoned 
the nature had really reclaimed the whole complex 
i was really frightened at first but i calmly explained to him that i was working on an art project and he didn't seem to mind and so i went ahead and put my camera on self-timer and ran back and forth 
that homeless man to me really represented an element of the unconscious of the city 
they were consistently dug as limestone quarries and by the 18th century the caving-in of some of these quarries posed safety threats so the government ordered reinforcing of the existing quarries and dug new observation tunnels in order to monitor and map the whole place 
as you can see the system is very complex and vast 
i'm going to try and explain why it is that perhaps we don't understand as much as we think we do 
i think we agree on that where does the tree get the stuff that makes up this chair right where does all this stuff come from 
and would you be able to kind of draw a -- you don't have to draw the diagram but would you be able to draw the diagram if you had to do it or would you just say that's actually not possible 
that's what plants actually do for a living 
so these mental models -- we look for evidence that reinforces our models 
and it's amateur but amateur in the best sense in other words the root of the word being of love and passion 
and governments do very well they pat themselves on the back 
ok we collude and actually if you -- if someone had designed a test for me when i was doing my biology exams to really understand to see whether i'd understood more than just kind of putting starch and iodine together and seeing it go blue and really understood that plants took their mass out of the air then i might have done better at science 
i love manipulating the infrastructure of biology 
but within that infrastructure we have to remember that the driving force of biology is really coming from evolution 
this is a dead crystal and i'm going to do something to it and it's going to become alive 
but there's a problem because up until maybe a decade ago we were told that life was impossible and that we were the most incredible miracle in the universe 
if we can make matter alive would we have a matterhazard 
chemists are trying to study the molecules to look at disease 
you can decode the genome you can look back you can link us all together by a mitochondrial dna but we can't get further than the last ancestor the last visible cell that we could sequence or think back in history 
what is life what is this stuff of life 
so the whole area's been stuck for a while and it got reignited in the '80s when analytical technologies and computer technologies were coming on 
and the answer of course lies with mice 
they're all made of the same stuff but they want their shape to win 
and that is the key 
let's zoom out to what that could mean 
if we could get evolution into the material world then i propose we should have a general theory of evolution 
and that's really worth thinking about 
so that means we could then start to develop different platforms for exploring this evolution 
so you imagine if we're able to create a self-sustaining artificial life form not only will this tell us about the origin of life -- that it's possible that the universe doesn't need carbon to be alive it can use anything -- we can then take [it] one step further and develop new technologies because we can then use software control for evolution to code in 
but not only just that we will start to think about how we can start to develop a symbiotic relationship with biology 
evolution cannot be cut apart 
and we're really becoming very close to understanding the key steps that makes dead stuff come alive 
we are here today because [the] united nations have defined goals for the progress of countries 
look here -- you have to end poverty education gender child and maternal health control infections protect the environment and get the good global links between nations in every aspect from aid to trade 
that's a four percent reduction per year -- and this with measuring 
i'll prove them wrong on both points 
and i will take kenya as an example 
i was actually on friday sitting in front of my computer and i saw the death rate fall from 128 to 84 just that morning 
that's unfair 
had i been in the ministry of health in kenya i may have joined these two points 
so look at the average here -- this is the average for all of sub-saharan africa 
i give you congo which was high ghana -- lower and kenya -- even lower 
their countries are so different and they merit to be recognized in the same way as we don't talk about europe as one place 
there we are today 
how the heck could they be [a] developing country 
look -- even if we look in africa -- these are the african countries 
it's very clear that this is what happens 
that is when we get girls in school we'll get an impact 15 to 20 years later which is a secular trend which is very strong 
it's a decent life for children we are talking about 
do we care about those four billion people whose income levels are less than two dollars a day the so-called bottom of the pyramid 
but if you don't have money what happens 
and if they do so then of course the conditions improve and they start riding on scooters 
an innovator is one who does not know it cannot be done 
they combine all that 
and it was that compassion which bothered them because when he saw -- in fact he told me about eight or nine years ago how he was driving his own car -- he drives his own car by the way -- and he saw in the rain a family like the one that i showed to you getting drenched with an infant 
for example how we started ratan just began with a five-engineer team young people in their mid-twenties 
it was an open innovation ideas from all over were welcome 
and the seat riser for example serving as a mounting for the seat as well as a structural part of the functional rigidity 
and british motor was around 11000 
and unbelievably in 40 years i was the first indian to be honored 
and unique high-ankle design and human-like looks [unclear] and functions 
are you getting more drugs because you are spending more time and more money 
the ideas have to be such that you think in completely different terms 
and incubator costs 2000 dollars 
but then he held it for a little while lakshmi 
that gave me a great message focus and you can achieve 
and currently i'm president of global research alliance 60000 scientists in nine counties right from india to the us 
commodities are things that you grow in the ground raise on the ground or pull out of the ground basically animal mineral vegetable 
long-distance telephone service sold on price price price fast-food restaurants with all their value pricing and even the internet is commoditizing not just goods but services as well 
now most places that i talk to when i talk about experience i talk about disney -- the world's premier experience-stager 
and then i always finish off by talking about -- the thing that amazes me the most about this question particularly coming from the dutch is that the netherlands is every bit as manufactured as disneyland 
in fact you can look at how each of these economies developed that each one has their own business imperative matched with a consumer sensibility 
because all businesses are man-made objects all business is involved with money all business is a matter of using machinery and all those things make something inauthentic 
at the end of a laundry list of advice he's giving to his son laertes he says this and this above all to thine own self be true 
as businesses are the economic offerings you are providing -- are they true to themselves 
and of course if you are both true to yourself and are what you say you are then you're real real 
universal city walk is a real fake -- in fact we got this very term from ada louise huxtable's book the unreal america 
but is it really true to itself 
so she calls it a real fake 
so understand what -- your past limits what you can do in the future 
right if you could check into the ads you'd have a great experience 
then you have that perception that you are phony 
a few words about how i got started and it has a lot to do with happiness actually 
i would make things for people as a way of you know giving showing them my love 
so it has to end with this --  -- gratuitous violence 
so that was how i first started to explore the way things moved and expressed it 
i was also very interested in perhaps going into surgery and becoming a surgeon because it meant working with my hands in a very focused intense way 
when i see objects i imagine them in motion 
that's about that big 
this kind of work is also very much like puppetry where the found object is in a sense the puppet and i'm the puppeteer at first because i'm playing with an object 
and they would coalesce for just a moment so you could perceive that there was a chair there 
what would i love 
so this is a little wire-bending tool 
after many years of bending gears with a pair of pliers i made that tool and then i made this other tool for sort of centering gears very quickly -- sort of developing my own little world of technology 
and the idea their premise was that we wanted to show pieces of sculpture on the street and there'd be no subjective decision about what was the best 
so i'll just let this chair come down 
and what we were going to do was scan a new project on the development of the fetus from conception to birth using these kinds of new technologies 
25 days heart chamber developing 32 days arms &amp hands are developing 36 days beginning of the primitive vertabrae these weeks are the period of the most rapid development of the fetus 
51 days 52 days developing retina nose and fingers the fetus' continual movement in the womb is necessary for muscular and skeletal growth 
every six months until they're six years old -- we're going to be doing actually to about 250 children -- watching exactly how the gyri and the sulci of the brains fold to see how this magnificent development actually turns into memories and the marvel that is us 
i'm a spectroscopist 
sometimes we have to deal with just one tiny weak spectral line to measure the composition of that chemical element in the atmosphere 
for instance you see the spectral line of the gold is the only spectral line in the spectrum of the sun 
it's a heavy element produced in thermonuclear explosions of supernovae 
it's the only place where you can produce actually osmium 
it was incredible the only conclusion we could make from this is clear evidence that there was a supernova explosion in this system which polluted the atmosphere of this star 
they actually said that one of the stars you see in the spectra is an alien it comes from a different galaxy 
and sometimes they just capture stars 
we were very surprised to discover a super flare a flare which is thousands of millions of times more powerful than those we see in the sun 
this can be done with the future spectrographs 
coming back to the most important question is there anybody out there 
connection between life and radioactive nuclei is straightforward 
it's exactly the same game a very tiny feature 
it's amazing that we can detect vegetation from a spectrum 
now very recently very recently i'm talking about last six seven eight months water methane carbon dioxide have been detected in the spectrum of a planet outside the solar system 
and with the known physics etc it's something actually which has been pointed out by frank drake many years ago and shklovsky 
they want to actually signal their presence through these spectral lines in the spectrum of a star in different ways 
and we are doing this job since 2000 and it's a very heavy project 
we have been working very hard 
i think it will come from a spectrum like this 
it will take about five years 
and she said but the thing i liked about your talk is you're a storyteller 
and she said i'm going to call you a storyteller 
i'm a qualitative researcher 
and maybe i'm just a storyteller 
the other thing that they had in common was this they fully embraced vulnerability 
they're willing to invest in a relationship that may or may not work out 
do you have any recommendations 
and i said i'm great i'm okay 
i just need some strategies 
and then i said it's bad right 
the problem is -- and i learned this from the research -- that you cannot selectively numb emotion 
you can't numb those hard feelings without numbing the other affects our emotions 
religion has gone from a belief in faith and mystery to certainty 
there's no conversation 
which just i hope in 100 years people will look back and go wow 
and when you hold those perfect little babies in your hand our job is not to say look at her she's perfect 
my job is just to keep her perfect -- make sure she makes the tennis team by fifth grade and yale by seventh grade 
we do that in our personal lives 
it is as you can see very small and also very cheap 
so that when we think about using them to get some systematic improvement we also think about how they can be useful for self-improvement for self-discovery self-awareness self-knowledge 
some people will say it's for public health research 
thank you 
i want to talk about it in the context of a story 
all of our statuses are different 
all of our hopes and dreams what we want to accomplish is different and our paths will be different they are all stories 
and go from this concept of walking breathing and then his hands speak and ultimately happiness and function 
and we took this and we converted it into data 
but it's not a data point at that one moment in time 
so here's steven alone sharing this story in the world 
we need to give to others to be successful 
and i'm going to show you what patients like me the company that myself my youngest brother and a good friend from mit started 
but you can aggregate this and you can discover things about treatments 
so you can see the duration 
i'm going to log in 
and this is a new version of our platform we're launching right now 
i'm taking three drugs to manage it some of them are experimental 
so can i take this data -- rearrange yourself put the symptoms in the left the drugs across the top tell me everything we know about steven and everyone else and what interacts 
doctors actually love this sheet and they're actually really engaged 
ten percent of the people in our system took lithium 
it's never going to work you can't do it 
and then we say well how do we line them all up 
and it works almost every time 
and yeah all the clinicians in the audience will talk about power and all the standard deviation we'll do that later 
we hired them set them up assisting at lab 
because something went different 
and i am thankful 
we know what they are 
the b15 iceberg broke off the ross ice shelf 
and what if we could get exquisite control over the essence of energy the electron 
a tremendous amount of energy is coming at us from the sun 
wouldn't it be really great if the window could flick back the heat into the room if we needed it or flick it away before it came in 
we'd have to see at night right 
but because it's flexible it can be on any surface whatsoever 
it was in actually a diner outside of dallas/fort worth airport 
ebox is testing new nanomaterials to park an electron on the outside hold it until you need it and then be able to release it and pass it off 
19 trillion dollars is what we're going to have to spend 
i'm glad to be working with incredibly brilliant and kind scientists no kinder than many of the people in the world but they have a magic look at the world 
by any standard this is wrong 
i was two years older than my sister at the time -- i mean i'm two years older than her now -- but at the time it meant she had to do everything that i wanted to do and i wanted to play war 
and on the other side were all my sister's my little ponies ready for a cavalry charge 
i was nervous because my parents had charged me with making sure that my sister and i played as safely and as quietly as possible 
 with one broken leg 
i can delete that dot because that's clearly a measurement error 
so one of the very first things we teach people in economics and statistics and business and psychology courses is how in a statistically valid way do we eliminate the weirdos 
when i applied to harvard i applied on a dare 
i didn't expect to get in and my family had no money for college 
which i'm glad you liked but they did not like that at all 
here's how we get to health we need to reverse the formula for happiness and success 
doctors are 19 percent faster more accurate at coming up with the correct diagnosis when positive instead of negative neutral or stressed 
what we need to be able to do is to reverse this formula so we can start to see what our brains are actually capable of 
exercise teaches your brain that your behavior matters 
and by the way all of these numbers are significantly higher if you happen to be black if you happen to be poor if you happen to exist in an overcrowded school 
and so we're starting to see the establishment of men centers and men studies to think about how do we engage men in their experiences in the university 
the next reason that boys' cultures are out of sync with school cultures there are fewer male teachers 
but male role models for boys that say it's all right to be smart -- they've got dads they've got pastors they've got cub scout leaders but ultimately six hours a day five days a week they're spending in a classroom and most of those classrooms are not places where men exist 
this is a place for girls 
we have a serious compression of the curriculum happening out there 
and if you ask title 1 teachers they'll tell you they've got about four or five boys for every girl that's in their program in the elementary grades 
all of those conversations need to be happening 
who has a computer yeah 
ok so everyone has a computer 
i went to mit did my math but i had this wonderful opportunity because computers had just become visual 
remember that moment -- publishing your designs 
i didn't quite get it and paul rand was a kind of crusty designer you know a crusty designer like a good -- kind of like a good french bread 
this is the first sort of play thing i did my own serious play 
this is actually bad human experiments 
see humans don't know how to take orders the computer's so good at it 
this guy figured out how to get the computer to draw with two pens at once you know you pen do this and you pen do this 
and after this i wanted to build a computer out of people called a human-powered computer 
i have behind this wall a disk drive a cpu a graphics card a memory system 
on the computer when you move your mouse that arrow moves around 
i have no staff it's all kind of made by hand -- these sort of broken hands 
so naomi was pivotal in that 
so if you can see here you know that program you're seeing in the corner if you spread it out it's all these things all at once 
you get it no ok 
they're littler computers so the one-chip computers i began to program one-chip computers and make objects out of pc boards leds 
i did a show in london last year made out of ipods -- i used ipods as a material 
we have this gene defect in our mind 
this is from the cape last year 
this is also out there you know 
and i went after it with passion 
i was like aha wait a second 
so thank you everyone 
what is it about flying cars 
but we haven't yet gotten to the point where on your way here this morning you see something that really truly seamlessly integrates the two-dimensional world that we're comfortable in with the three-dimensional sky above us -- that i don't know about you but i really enjoy spending time in 
for those of us that spend most of our lives on the ground this may be counter-intuitive but driving has potholes cobblestones pedestrians other drivers and a rather long and detailed list of federal motor vehicle safety standards to contend with 
you just push a few buttons in the cockpit and the wings come out 
radio 2 that was gorgeous 
the transition will cost in line with other small airplanes 
and i'm certainly not out to replace your chevy but i do think that the transition should be your next airplane 
and mobility to your destination is clearly solved 
the question was given to a bunch of engineers about 15 years ago how do we make the journey to paris better 
what you should in fact do is employ all of the world's top male and female supermodels pay them to walk the length of the train handing out free chateau petrus for the entire duration of the journey 
they seem fantastic to me they cost very little to develop 
someone was actually suggesting that you can take this concept further and actually produce placebo education 
before long there was a massive underground potato-growing operation in germany 
now boring people would have just simply banned the veil 
all value is perceived value 
these funny signs that flash your speed at you some of the new ones on the bottom right now actually show a smiley face or a frowny face to act as an emotional trigger 
the wealthy prussians to help in the war against the french were encouraged to give in all their jewelry 
the interesting thing is that for 50 years hence the highest status jewelry you could wear in prussia wasn't made of gold or diamonds 
it was made of cast iron 
because actually never mind the actual intrinsic value of having gold jewelry this actually had symbolic value badge value 
if you think about it shakerism was a proto-environmental movement 
and that what we add on top is kind of false it's a fake version 
however what we do have now is a much more variegated media ecosystem in which to kind of create this kind of value and it's much fairer 
yet we've never created the opportunity for impulse saving 
i would say it's a work of genius 
so i just want to get your first impressions when you see that when you see the diamond shreddies box there 
but it's kind of like flipping a six or a nine like a six if you flip it over it looks like a nine 
thank you very much indeed 
we're seeing the consequences all around us 
i would say not just biological design but all of the design that we think of as human design 
and 100 pages later 
and another 100 pages later 
or design out of chaos without the aid of mind 
chaos no what mind no 
but that it will get copied if it can regardless of the consequences 
this is design process going on 
a meme is not equivalent to an idea 
audience sink toilet 
this has spread all over the world 
so this is a view of what humans are 
and indeed in the short time i've already been at ted i see we're even closer than i thought we were before 
we'll think we're choosing these things but the temes are making us do it 
it's been very productive that equation 
getting a new replicator is dangerous 
we may take the gaian view 
you know all about big brains 
and why would they do that 
so those are the two possibilities 
i have no idea 
i was afraid of a tsunami what i didn't realize was there was a greater terror in haiti and that was building collapse 
after all it was the buildings not the earthquake that killed 220000 people that injured 330000 that displaced 13 million people that cut off food and water and supplies for an entire nation 
behind that door is the national judicial archives 
now there's a solution to all these problems 
and because i had 70 percent of my body burned it would take about an hour 
so originally i didn't have much money so i went to a hardware store and i bought a carpenter's vice 
now ten commandments is something that is hard to bring into the education system so we said why don't we get people to sign the honor code 
and this is particularly interesting because mit doesn't have an honor code 
no bill ever disappeared 
we did not pay them with dollars we paid them with something else 
but this did not solve the big problem i had with enron yet because in enron there's also a social element 
so everybody got an envelope with all the money for the experiment and we told them that at the end we asked them to pay us back the money they didn't make ok 
what would happen to the other people in the group 
will they cheat more or will they cheat less 
all of the subjects sitting in the experiment were carnegie mellon students 
when we remind people about their morality they cheat less 
but unless we start testing those intuitions we're not going to do better 
okay 
well cèilidh first of all is gaelic for party but kitchen party in cape breton is very common and basically somebody drops into the house and no matter what house you go to in cape breton there's a fiddle there guaranteed and i'd say well there's first of all more fiddlers per capita in cape breton than anywhere in the world so ten chances to one the fellow who walked in the door could play it so you'd have someone come into the house you'd invite them to play a tune and lo and behold a little party would start up and somebody would dance and somebody would sing and all that sort of thing so it was a wonderful wonderful way to grow up and that is where my beginnings in music come from my surroundings my family just my bloodline in itself and oh i've done lots of things with my music 
donnell leahy thank you i'm kind of new to the ted experience and i'm glad to be here but i'm just trying to put it all together trying to figure all you people out and i've been here for a short while and i'm starting to understand a little bit better 
we learned to play the instruments but we kind of had to come from within or go from within because we didn't watch television we didn't listen to a lot of radio we went to church and to school sometimes and farmed and played music so we were able i think at a very critical age to develop our own style our own self and my mother plays my father plays and the style that came from the ottawa valley in ontario we call it french-canadian style but it originated in logging camps 
airs were played in europe at burials as a body was carried out from the wake site to the burial site the procession was led by a piper or a fiddle player 
we're laughing like because our styles are totally different as you can hear 
announcer great news they're running late downstairs 
when she got up to make tea she placed him in my own lap and i had never felt a child that was that emaciated 
single mother hiv positive 
i photographed her before and after the birth of her beautiful baby girl issa 
joyce's mother is now taking care of her daughter like so many other zimbabwean children who've been orphaned by the epidemic 
and i was constantly reading the new york times and stunned by the statistics the numbers 
so i quit my job and decided that that's the subject that i wanted to tackle 
we've known about fusion since 1920 when sir arthur stanley eddington and the british association for the advancement of science conjectured that that's why the sun shines 
and once it was sort of explained to me how fast we were using up the world's resources i got very upset about as upset as i did when i realized that the earth will only last about five billion years before it's swallowed by the sun 
energy at the moment is dominated by resource 
it's a medium-sized nucleus 
and indeed that's exactly what stars do 
so that's that process there deuterium and tritium goes together makes helium 5 
and that energy is what powers fusion 
and as you go across there you see a few tens of years of oil -- the blue line by the way is the lowest estimate of existing resources 
and as you go across there you will see that we've got a few tens of years and perhaps 100 years of fossil fuels left 
so how would we make it 
we can do fusion in the center of this device we made 16 megawatts of fusion power in 1997 
if you want to know how ask yourself this question what would you attempt to do if you knew you could not fail 
because when you ask it you begin to understand how the fear of failure constrains you how it keeps us from attempting great things and life gets dull amazing things stop happening 
the path to truly new never-been-done-before things always has failure along the way 
in october of 1903 the prevailing opinion of expert aerodynamicists was that maybe in 10 million years we could build an aircraft that would fly 
40 years later aero experts coined the term transonic 
since we took to the sky we have wanted to fly faster and farther 
it's boosted to near-space atop a minotaur iv rocket 
that's an unnatural act for a rocket 
the third stage has a camera 
this is the actual rocketcam footage from flight one 
now to conceal the shape we changed the aspect ratio a little bit 
this is a hummingbird drone 
it does not eat nectar 
or perhaps spider man will one day be gecko man 
each lightning bolt heats the air to 44000 degrees fahrenheit -- hotter than the surface of the sun 
using a grid the size of your thumb with 32 electrodes on the surface of his brain tim uses his thoughts to control an advanced prosthetic arm 
this green goo is perhaps the vaccine that could save your life 
they are nerds and they are heroes among us 
there is only time enough to iron your cape and back to the skies for you 
well i don't think we ultimately know what it will be right 
it's actually look at that cute hummingbird flying into my headquarters 
well look our singular mission is the creation and prevention of strategic surprise 
that's what we do 
and you persuade people to go to these great feats of invention but at a personal level in a way i can't imagine doing your job 
but quite frankly on this issue there is no other road 
sorry this was my mother by the way in her bead shop in london 
because just that soil could make the acoustic difference 
and the british government saying you need to be in the top five 
but you just have to go to a garden center and they're in little paper packets 
and so there was one particular toy that gave us a clue 
and the government agreed to do that and not do anything else and focus our energy on that 
this is the only project that we've done where the finished thing looked more like a rendering than our renderings 
i'm sorry about my stupid voice there 
so if we could chop that away and give the building a small bottom we could take that bit and put it at the top where the greater commercial value is for a property developer 
thank you 
june cohen so thank you thank you thomas you're a delight 
well that fundamental sense of oneness is lost on us very quickly 
the self changed got affected broken destroyed but another one would evolve -- sometimes stronger sometimes hateful sometimes not wanting to be there at all 
the self was not constant 
but nature had its wicked way and brown babies were born 
it was the first time that i existed inside a fully-functioning self -- one that i controlled that i steered that i gave life to 
well i thought i had the answer to that one and i said skin color 
for a start we can think about all the times when we do lose ourselves 
i take it to therapy 
and in that disconnected state yeah we can build factory farms with no windows destroy marine life and use rape as a weapon of war 
thank you for listening 
you can see my fellow riders at the end of the picture looking at me with some concern 
and here is another picture of them 
they are supposed to be locked up 
and i became increasingly more and more agitated because i was there not only to be with them but also to ride and create a team and i didn't know what to do 
we're going downhill in some rocky terrain and the front tire of alex gets caught in one of these crevasses here 
i've had it 
it took me several such incidents to figure out what i was supposed to do 
at the beginning it was a disaster 
i tried harsh words and threats and they took me nowhere 
go away you maniac-psychopath 
and i would say relax alex 
so for such a kid when an adult that he learns to respect stays close to him and doesn't walk away from him in any situation irrespective of how he behaves it's a tremendous healing experience 
now i come from a cutthroat world of science and high technology 
i used to think that reason and logic and relentless drive were the only ways to make things happen 
all you have to do is play with it change it a little bit and come up with something that does help that does work 
or you can also look back in time and realize that you've already conquered steeper mountains before 
and so we talked about these special words that we teach them 
in every one of these rides i always end up standing in one of these incredible locations taking in this incredible landscape around me and i feel blessed and fortunate that i'm alive and that i sense every fiber in my aching body 
the blank slate was an influential idea in the 20th century 
this is a recent study by the neurobiologist paul thompson and his colleagues in which they -- using mri -- measured the distribution of gray matter -- that is the outer layer of the cortex -- in a large sample of pairs of people 
and as you can see large amounts of the brain are not purple showing that if one person has a thicker bit of cortex in that region so does his fraternal twin 
and here's what happens if you get a pair of people who share all their dna -- namely clones or identical twins 
another political fear of human nature is that if we are blank slates we can perfect mankind -- the age-old dream of the perfectibility of our species through social engineering 
and so when thomas jefferson wrote in the declaration of independence we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal he did not mean we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are clones 
that is because the human mind is a complex system with many parts and some of them can inhibit others 
for example there's excellent reason to believe that virtually all humans are born with a moral sense and that we have cognitive abilities that allow us to profit from the lessons of history 
well the night is young but the book has been out for half a year and nothing terrible has happened 
visual arts -- decoration of surfaces and bodies -- appears to be a human universal 
a paraphrase of a quote by virginia woolf and there's some debate as to what she actually meant by that 
i mean this is perhaps a representative example of the visual depiction of the female form in the 15th century here is a representative example of the depiction of the female form in the 20th century 
well this turned out to be probably the most controversial claim in the book 
and the job in question was sheep rancher 
this one was actually around the playing cards i got yesterday but it had a certain familiarity to it 
albert is the shepherd in question 
albert goes in i follow albert the crew is around 
i say time out stop 
we don't fool around we don't rehearse -- we shoot what we get 
and i'm like i don't know what just happened but there are testicles in this bucket and that's not how we do it 
he says ok 
gets up walks to the corner it's quivering and it lies down and it's in obvious distress 
he's like a day 
and i was reminded how utterly wrong i am so much of the time 
melanie picks up the lamb puts it on the post opens it up 
i do 
and i'm like what is this jacked-up metaphor 
anagnorisis is the greek word for discovery 
that's peripety or peripeteia 
it's crushing when the audience sees it the right way 
looking at that poor other little thing that i'd done it the right way on and i just was struck by if i'm wrong about that and if i'm wrong so often in a literal way what other peripatetic misconceptions might i be able to comment upon 
i mean these are the people that i work with every single day 
because dude you know four years 
you know follow your dreams and go broke right 
right 
they know that other things come first -- the business of doing the work comes first the business of getting it done 
most hazardous environment i'd ever seen and i was back with a guy lashing the pots down 
i scamper down i go into the wheelhouse and i say with some level of incredulity captain osha 
it goes like this -- we've declared war on work as a society all of us 
we turn them into heroes or we turn them into punch lines 
i just know that that's a front in this war 
and i realized probably too late in this game -- i hope not because i don't know if i can do 200 more of these things -- but we're going to do as many as we can 
it's been great talking to you and get back to work will you 
democracy as a type of politics is a technology for the control and deployment of power 
i would put it in the following equation no 9/11 no war 
islam represents a way of engaging the world through which one can achieve certain desirable goals 
you can show the capitol -- i had the same problem when i was designing the cover of my forthcoming book in fact -- what do you put on the cover to show democracy 
you can show a mosque or you can show worshippers but there's not a straightforward way of depicting islam 
these are contested points and it's impossible to answer them by saying ah ha i looked in the right place and i found out what these concepts mean 
and i think that that's in fact probably the first appropriate response 
and the hopeful response derives from recognizing that islam and democracy are technologies 
and they're making this argument wherever they're permitted to make it 
they were actually blocked from even forming a party under the political system there why 
now what i want to suggest to you is that the reason for hope in this case is that we are on the edge of a real transformation in the muslim world 
when these heartbreaking images of oiled birds finally began to emerge from the gulf of mexico last year during the horrific bp oil spill a german biologist by the name of silvia gaus was quoted as saying we should just euthanize all oiled birds because studies have shown that fewer than one percent of them survive after being released 
and the local seabird rescue center named sanccob immediately launched a massive rescue operation -- and this soon would become the largest animal rescue ever undertaken 
i was a penguin aquarist at the new england aquarium 
i was instantly transported back to that moment in time 
so for the few of us that were there in a professional capacity this extraordinary volunteer response to this animal crisis was profoundly moving and awe-inspiring 
now mind you three days earlier we had 60 penguins under our care so we were definitely overwhelmed and just a bit terrified -- at least i was 
and you may notice they're wearing very thick gloves 
he said okay why don't we try and collect the birds at the greatest risk of getting oiled -- they collected 20000 -- and we'll ship them 500 miles up the coast to port elizabeth in these open air trucks and release them into the clean waters there and let them swim back home 
about a year prior to this oil spill a 17 year-old student had invented a degreaser 
just look at that 17 year-old 
and the two main threats to penguins today are overfishing and global warming 
and i was doing some rather controversial religious programs 
this went down very well in the uk where religion is extremely unpopular 
indeed some of the world traditions think very little of religious orthodoxy 
you behave in a committed way and then you begin to understand the truths of religion 
why because in compassion when we feel with the other we dethrone ourselves from the center of our world and we put another person there and once we get rid of ego then we're ready to see the divine 
and in particular every single one of the major world traditions has highlighted -- has said -- and put at the core of their tradition what's become known as the golden rule 
hillel stood on one leg and said that which is hateful to you do not do to your neighbor that is the torah the rest is commentary 
so the traditions also insisted -- and this is an important point i think -- that you could not and must not confine your compassion to your own group your own nation your own co-religionists your own fellow countrymen you must have what one of the chinese sages called jian ai concern for everybody love your enemies honor the stranger 
and this again -- this universal outreach -- is getting subdued in the strident use of religion -- abuse of religion -- for nefarious gains 
now i've lost count of the number of taxi drivers who when i say to them what i do for a living inform me that religion has been the cause of all the major world wars in history wrong 
because it seems to me that with -- our current situation is so serious at the moment that any ideology that doesn't promote a sense of global understanding and global appreciation of each other is failing the test of the time 
i was part of that united nations initiative called the alliance of civilizations which was asked by kofi annan to diagnose the causes of extremism and to give practical guidelines to member states about how to avoid the escalation of further extremism 
it was just one of those pot-luck things where you get it right first time 
moving on to something a bit larger this is an x-ray of a bus 
it's not just topshop i get some strange looks when i go out getting my props 
and to carry on with a theme that we've already touched with is how nature is related to architecture 
in fact that is three months solid x-raying 
and when they do i'm in the queue 
so i like to use them 
that flower doesn't come in bright orange i don't think 
i'm now going to show you a short film i'll step to the side 
the bus was done with a cargo-scanning x-ray machine which is used on the borders between countries looking for contraband and illegal immigrants 
i will show how the capillary action works how it feeds i'll be able to get all the cells inside that stem 
sometimes you keep the time up because the time gives you detail 
the longer the exposure goes on for the more detail you get 
i've got the opportunity now to show you what i'm going to be doing in the future 
like my first computer was a big movement in my life 
meet tony he's my student 
if i ever get out of here there will always be a mark by my name 
i'm a convict i am branded 'wrong' what are you going to tell me about right and wrong 
then can you tell me what wrong is 
socrates died in prison his philosophy intact 
his body is in prison but his mind is free 
yes they gave 12 monkeys a typewriter for a week and after a week they only used it as a bathroom 
you'll been engulfed by a red giant 
love does not die because of that thing 
i'm very lucky because he's better than all the other children 
that's the wonderful thing about evolution -- the predilection to believe that our child is best 
now in many ways that's just a survival thing 
the fact we see here is the vehicle for our genes and therefore we love it 
but we don't notice that bit we just unconditionally love 
perhaps you've been at home for a week on your own 
you house is in a terrible state 
you think what should i do 
for me it's a very very important thing 
i look out the window and i realize that every single time we stop and i look out that window framed in that window wherever we are i am observing more life than there is in the rest of the known universe beyond the planet earth 
that to me is an incredible thing 
i began the vagina monologues because i was worried about vaginas 
what does anyone mean when they talk about real security 
this is of course unless your whole life is about being secure 
you become whatever it is that will freeze you numb you and protect you from doubt or change 
but all this does actually is shut down your mind 
one of the amazing things that i've discovered in my travels is that there is this emerging species 
i've discovered these people who in v-day world we call vagina warriors 
they raised 10000 dollars on a production that never occurred 
now this seems like a fairly you know frivolous but what happened as a result of that is that that school now is forming a sex education class it's beginning to talk about sex it's beginning to look at why it would be wrong for a young high school girl to talk about her vagina publicly or to say that she loved her vagina publicly 
in the years that she walked she educated parents mothers fathers 
real security is contemplating death not pretending it doesn't exist 
and i think part of what i'm learning in this process is that one must allow oneself to feel grief 
now i was stupid but not so stupid that i turned it down 
it is the story factory one of the very best in the world 
but they all have one thing in common they all need to look like something 
they all need a face 
the first was katharine hepburn's memoirs and the second was a biography of marlene dietrich 
so the hepburn story is words and the dietrich story is pictures and so we did this 
and what i ended up with was a graphic representation of us seeing this animal coming into being 
no that is not me 
that's a responsibility 
a book cover is a distillation 
this story was a real puzzle 
huhh and now the sultan is in danger 
don't get me started 
but something is definitely lost tradition a sensual experience the comfort of thingy-ness -- a little bit of humanity 
what does it look like 
yes it can it does and it will but for this book designer page-turner dog-eared place-holder notes in the margins-taker ink-sniffer the story looks like this 
the students should teach their teachers 
well we heard that one too but pioneer germ fighters totally rules 
instead of just scoffing at this heresy that a kid wanted to get published or saying wait until you're older my parents were really supportive 
the school i went to was pretty boring 
and that was the finishing post right there 
but our school at that time got a grant from the government and they got an incredible computer -- the research machine 3dz -- and they left the programming manuals lying around 
that's what they thought they had built it for 
this is one of my favorite ones here where they have rabbit breeding so males choose the lucky rabbit 
so i went on for the next 20 years or so making a lot of different games 
now chris did ask me to bring some statistics with me so i've done that 
but 83 percent of games don't have any mature content whatsoever so it's just not true 
it makes about 80 million bucks a month in subscriptions 
i wanted to update that video and give you a new look at it 
i played in the backyard learned to read and even ate some of my vegetables 
but as was the case for most of my generation i spent a lot of time in front of the tv 
their importance blends into the sensationalized drama of prime time tv 
i have fought in wars feared for my own survival watched my cohorts die on beaches and woods that look and feel more real than any textbook or any news story 
as gamers we are now living by the same laws of physics in the same cities and doing many of the same things we once did in real life only virtually 
the sensory cues are very similar 
more beautiful and rich than the real world around us 
video games are fun engaging and leave your brain completely vulnerable to re-programming 
there is a potential to do good as well 
wow 
this is just a cool shot because this is students coming to school after class 
she's never going to know a world where video games aren't incredibly emotional and will probably make her cry 
chris anderson david perry that was awesome 
it's this change in perspective on what it is we think we're perceiving that has helped us make more progress in the last 400 years than we have in the rest of human history 
so one of the things that goes from simple to complex is when we do more we like more 
and in fact what murray was talking about yesterday in the fractal beauty of nature -- of having the descriptions at various levels be rather similar -- all goes down to the idea that the elementary particles are both sticky and standoffish and they're in violent motion 
not because it wasn't beautiful or anything but because it misses the thing that most students fail to understand about molecular biology and that is why is there any probability at all of two complex shapes finding each other just the right way so they combine together and be catalyzed 
so they had created these artifacts 
so that's what lauren did 
each time i click it car turn 
teacher [choose] objects that you think will fall to the earth at the same time 
who's got the apple 
we've done that already 
galileo by the way did this very cleverly by running a ball backwards down the strings of his lute 
i'm focusing on biology the biological sciences 
and thereby hangs a tale 
you just have to look at the human genome project 
we're reading the book of life 
on the way there it's going to completely revolutionize medicine and health care that's obvious 
what we're doing is we are seizing control of our evolutionary future 
that is going to be the it challenge of the next generation is communicating all this information 
we're sort of circumventing evolutionary programs that guide our behavior 
it didn't happen 
and pretty soon it's going to be possible to avoid virtually all genetic diseases in that way 
directly going in -- it's a little bit further away but not that far away -- going in and altering the genes in the first cell in an embryo 
people can try and ban these things 
other people are going to say this is great 
and from the beginning of today's sessions you'd think that they're going to see this as this horrible difficult painful period that we struggled through 
and i don't think that's what's going to happen 
they are going to think about it as this glorious instant when we laid down the very foundations of their lives of their society of their future 
i have a daughter mulan 
it's our own pond and that's how it happens 
i know 
she's like what and she goes but mom but men and women can't ever see each other naked mom 
human males and females develop a special bond and when they're much older much much older than you and they have a very special feeling then they can be naked together 
i don't understand the legs 
well the internet has empowered us 
and as he came the second day i thought wow that's really a cartoon lover 
you will not like it 
this looks like a giant hamburger 
i was there to report on that story in cartoons 
i said well maybe we don't have time for this right now 
show the positive power of cartoons 
and i've been doing projects like this in 2009 in lebanon this year in kenya back in january 
so this was a great project 
so i want to start out with this beautiful picture from my childhood 
if you go back two billion years you're not on an earth-like planet any more 
what we call an earth-like planet is actually a very short interval of time 
we are right now in the beautiful oreo of existence -- of at least life on planet earth -- following the first horrible microbial age 
we have as much time for animals to exist on this planet as they have been here now till we hit the second microbial age 
and that's the fate of a planet too 
all along it was thought to be either an act of god or perhaps long slow climate change and that really changed in 1980 in this rocky outcrop near gubbio where walter alvarez trying to figure out what was the time difference between these white rocks which held creatures of the cretaceous period and the pink rocks above which held tertiary fossils 
a 10-kilometer body hit the planet 
this is a gorgonopsian or a gorgon 
but there's lots of stuff 
this is called paleontological child abuse 
and the what i think is that we returned over and over again to the pre-cambrian world that first microbial age and the microbes are still out there 
and the last three years have seen an enormous breakthrough in a brand-new field 
we had these hydrogen sulfide oceans for a very great long period 
this is a tracking experiment and any of you scuba divers if you want to get involved in one of the coolest projects ever this is off the great barrier reef 
this is a great white shark that ate some of my traps 
we pulled it up up it comes so it's out there with me at night 
tried to figure out how to save americans after battlefield injuries 
now the same mouse is given 80 parts per million hydrogen sulfide in this solid graph and look what happens to its temperature 
do we all have to have a little button saying let me die 
so what we're looking at now does it leave a signal 
it's simultaneously an incredible medical technique but also a terrifying  
this cell phone started its trajectory in an artisanal mine in the eastern congo 
and all of those products probably end their lives in a dump like this one in manila 
some of these governance gaps are run by rogue states 
but right now most of the companies involved in these supply chains don't have any way of assuring us that nobody had to mortgage their future nobody had to sacrifice their rights to bring us our favorite brand name product 
now i didn't come here to depress you about the state of the global supply chain 
it's a pharmaceutical product 
you expect that the supply chain that gets it to the hospital probably squeaky clean 
so a couple of years ago we had a scandal which killed about 80 people around the world because of contaminants that crept into the heparin supply chain 
and the usfda has a jurisdictional problem 
but they are extremely efficient organizations 
you can call yourself responsible but responsibility without accountability often doesn't work 
just look at pandemics -- swine flu bird flu h1n1 
there are thousands of suppliers in there 
it seems too daunting too dangerous for any company to take on 
please ask them to treat us like human beings 
so i appeal to you 
okay there's a few heartbreaks that chocolate can't fix 
your voice is small but don't ever stop singing 
but there are plenty of things i have trouble understanding 
spoken word poetry is the art of performance poetry 
and step three began when i realized that i didn't have to write poems that were indignant if that's not what i was 
and actually phil kaye and i coincidentally also share the same last name 
and the first list that i assign is 10 things i know to be true 
at a certain point you would realize that someone has the exact same thing or one thing very similar to something on your list 
and fourth someone has something you thought you knew everything about but they're introducing a new angle of looking at it 
and i said charlotte it sounds pretty interesting to me 
somebody once told me it's like walking through life like this 
and what was left of the city soon followed 
the long-lasting damage of nuclear radiation caused an entire city and its population to turn into powder 
but in hiroshima some people were wiped clean away leaving only a wristwatch or a diary page 
in the original story god told sarah she could do something impossible and she laughed because the first sarah she didn't know what to do with impossible 
but on the front step a person who was sitting there blocked the rays from hitting the stone 
they not only recorded history they helped change the course of history 
and as a reaction it stimulates public opinion and gives impetus to public debate thereby preventing the interested parties from totally controlling the agenda much as they would like to 
that was a tradition i wanted to follow 
seeing the war created such incredibly high stakes for everyone involved and that visual journalism could actually become a factor in conflict resolution -- i wanted to be a photographer in order to be a war photographer 
in 1981 i went to northern ireland 
during the early '80s i spent a lot of time in central america which was engulfed by civil wars that straddled the ideological divide of the cold war 
he literally had nothing he was a virtual skeleton yet he could still summon the courage and the will to move 
he had not given up and if he didn't give up how could anyone in the outside world ever dream of losing hope 
an aluminum factory in czechoslovakia was filled with carcinogenic smoke and dust and four out of five workers came down with cancer 
when the story was published unsolicited donations poured in 
i tried to tell the story through the work of caregivers 
i thought it was important to emphasize that people were being helped whether by international ngos or by local grassroots organizations 
the international community still hasn't found a way to create the pressure necessary to stop this genocide 
i'd been photographing in the islamic world since 1981 -- not only in the middle east but also in africa asia and europe 
for the first time in years shi'ites were allowed to make the pilgrimage to karbala to observe ashura and i was amazed by the sheer number of people and how fervently they practiced their religion 
the spirit they displayed was absolutely remarkable 
photographers go to the extreme edges of human experience to show people what's going on 
and therefore i will limit myself to only talk about the links between religion and sexuality 
so i will talk of what i remember as the most wonderful 
it's when the young couple whisper tonight we are going to make a baby 
will the number of children increase each year up to 15 years or will it continue in the same fast rate and be four billion children up there 
so bear with our simplicity now when i take you over to this shot 
and here the income per person in comparable dollars 
otherwise it was only christian countries 
and by 2010 we are actually 80 percent of humans who live in countries with about two children per woman 
but 30 years from now afghanistan will go from 30 million to 60 million 
it's an amazing improvement from seven children per woman they've gone all the way down to between four and five 
well i do as i always do 
i went to the statistical authority of qatar to their webpage -- it's a very good webpage i recommend it -- and i looked up -- oh yeah you can have lots of fun here -- and provided free of charge i found qatar's social trends 
now look again at this 
so what will happen now is quite straightforward 
most of us have to trust that that happens correctly for our own vote and we all have to trust that that happens correctly for all the votes in the election 
so this is how you vote 
so you let a poll station worker scan your encrypted vote 
and these are elections by the people for the people 
i was in india this past year and i may have seen the last cases of polio in the world 
and he made an outrageous prediction that smallpox would be eradicated and that this was god's gift to humanity because of the hard work of dedicated scientists 
audience early detection early response 
and india was the place where smallpox made its last stand 
you could vaccinate everybody in india but one year later there'll be 21 million new babies which was then the population of canada 
we had a scorecard that we wrote on every house 
this may be the year we eradicate polio -- that will make it the second disease in history 
i hope that you will take a look at it 
would you get in an airplane with 250 people you didn't know coughing and sneezing when you knew that some of them might carry a disease that could kill you for which you had no antivirals or vaccine 
i asked them -- these are all fluologists and specialists in influenza -- and i asked them the questions you'd like to ask them 
within three weeks it will be everywhere in the world 
let's increase the websites that they crawl from 20000 to 20 million 
then a number of years went by and there were a lot of rumors about bird flu 
they reported this to who who took a little while taking action because who will only receive a report from a government because it's the united nations 
now what's really important is that before there was gphin 100 percent of all the world's reports of bad things -- whether you're talking about famine or you're talking about bird flu or you're talking about ebola -- 100 percent of all those reports came from nations 
the moment these guys in ottawa on a budget of 800000 dollars a year got cracking 75 percent of all the reports in the world came from gphin 25 percent of all the reports in the world came from all the other 180 nations 
now here's what's real interesting after they'd been working for a couple years what do you think happened to those nations 
i was this weird little kid who wanted to have deep talks about the worlds that might exist beyond the ones that we perceive with our senses 
take a breath right now of this clear air in this room 
they've made me a proud i-don't-know-it-all 
and we used some guidelines to keep our conversation elevated and you can use them too because i know you're all going to take an other to lunch 
my lunch partner and i came away with some really important insights and i'm going to share just one with you 
and since we had established some trust we believed in each other's sincerity 
we agreed we'd speak up in our own communities when we witnessed the kind of otherizing talk that can wound and fester into paranoia and then be used by those on the fringes to incite 
instead we had taken first steps together past our knee-jerk reactions to the ubuntu place which is the only place where solutions to our most intractable-seeming problems will be found 
because ubuntu work is slow and it's difficult 
it's two people two warriors dropping their weapons and reaching toward each other 
in my life when i tried to achieve things like success or recognition they eluded me 
and it is for me a language which expressed the intangible and gives voice to people and stories without 
joshua claims to have personally killed more than 10000 people during liberia's civil war 
but what i saw opened my eyes to an idea of forgiveness which i never thought possible 
i was intensely moved during all this 
and yes all of those people killed were male 
many of the women are married with children and they say the hardest part of their deployment was being kept away from their children 
and when i asked one of the women about the shock and awe response she said don't worry same thing back home 
we know how to deal with these fellows and ignored them 
sometimes when the war is over and all the film crews have left the most inspiring stories are the ones that float just beneath the radar 
they answer more than 5000 calls in just two months 
it seems that this story helped change perceptions about the dfs at least in the minds of an audience in part on televisions read magazines and whose huts aren't on fire 
that's right yeah very rarely do we ever know and if we find out at some stage then we destroy that information as soon as possible 
wow so your leak really substantially changed the world 
let me know when you've got them let's shoot 
hotel  bushmaster two-six bushmaster two-six we need to move time now 
two-six this is two-six we're mobile 
what was the key element of this that actually caused the outrage do you think 
i mean in general what's your philosophy 
we have a way of dealing with information that has sort of personal -- personally identifying information in it 
yeah we do get a lot of that 
but do you see any irony in the fact that in order for you to shine that light you have to yourself create secrecy around your sources 
you know there might be a couple of views of wikileaks and of julian 
so late last year -- in november last year -- there was a series of well blowouts in albania like the well blowout in the gulf of mexico but not quite as big 
so under that basis we put it out and said look we're skeptical about this thing 
i mean we're an organization that is hard to grow very quickly because of the sort of material we deal with so we have to restructure in order to have people who will deal with the highest national security stuff and then lower security cases 
can that be right 
and you were also -- i mean you were also a hacker at an early age and ran into the authorities early on 
so this phrase is not not as nice as it used to be 
so just tell us very quickly in the last minute the story what happened in iceland 
instead they publicized your side 
however no studies exist yet that show how or why 
but then one night my mom was cooking grilled chicken for dinner and i noticed that the edges of the chicken which had been marinated in lemon juice turned white 
and later in biology class i learned that it's due to a process called denaturing which is where the proteins will change shape and lose their ability to chemically function 
i was the 17-18 year-old age category winner and then the grand prize winner 
and that was my first science fair project 
my parents suffered through many more of my science fair projects including a remote controlled garbage can 
and that's huge 
so that was my work and it was my way of reimagining the future for future research with figuring out exactly what this protein does but also for the future of chemotherapy effectiveness -- so maybe all grandfathers with cancer have a little bit more time to spend with their grandchildren 
but soon after i developed a novel mathematical model that essentially quantifies the effect of these environmental pollutants on the lung health of asthmatic patients 
and it surprises me that no model currently exists that quantifies the effect of environmental factors on human lung health because that relationship seems so important 
because i realized that if we could find a way to target remediation we could also find a way to treat asthmatic patients more effectively 
these chemical pollutants are currently not a criteria air pollutant as defined by the us clean air act 
so any user can come in here and click on lung function report and it'll take them to this report that i created 
my translation medium is a very simple basket 
that means that it is the numbers that control the form not me 
i use these scores to collaborate with musicians 
this piece here is read very differently depending on where you place it 
you place it in a science museum it becomes a three-dimensional visualization of data 
so after being interrogated by this japanese manager for a half an hour he finally said so miss yang do you have any questions to ask me 
and sometimes i have young people approaching me say lan you changed my life and i feel proud of that 
so it means young couples will have to support four parents who have a life expectancy of 73 years old 
so making a living is not that easy for young people 
and for those who are ready to get married and buy their apartment they figured out they have to work for 30 to 40 years to afford their first apartment 
for those who do return back to the countryside they find themselves very welcome locally because with the knowledge skills and networks they have learned in the cities with the assistance of the internet they're able to create more jobs upgrade local agriculture and create new business in the less developed market 
and after hours of negotiation 500 dogs were rescued 
and here also people are helping to find missing children 
i guess these are the questions people are going to answer 
and our younger generation are going to transform this country while at the same time being transformed themselves 
they only learn to be frightened of those differences when an adult influences them to behave that way and maybe censors that natural curiosity or you know reins in the question-asking in the hopes of them being polite little kids 
the doors open the kids descend on this table of legs and they are poking and prodding and they're wiggling toes and they're trying to put their full weight on the sprinting leg to see what happens with that 
and immediately a voice shouted kangaroo 
and then one eight-year-old said hey why wouldn't you want to fly too 
so this magazine through the hands of graphic designer peter saville went to fashion designer alexander mcqueen and photographer nick knight who were also interested in exploring that conversation 
today i have over a dozen pair of prosthetic legs that various people have made for me and with them i have different negotiations of the terrain under my feet and i can change my height -- i have a variable of five different heights 
today i'm 6'1 
it's a conversation about augmentation 
as lord blackstone described it land is protected by trespass law for most of the history of trespass law by presuming it protects the land all the way down below and to an indefinite extent upward 
and bmi was much more democratic in the art that it would include within its repertoire including african american music for the first time in the repertoire 
in my view the most significant thing to recognize about what this internet is doing is its opportunity to revive the read-write culture that sousa romanticized 
white europeans were subject to the plague 
we can date it to 700 years ago 
and if you're thinking of efficient information storage mechanisms it may not turn out to be chips 
we're just beginning this journey of life in the new zoo 
and you can do strange things with this stuff this is a baby gar 
now the last of these things died in september 1936 
and if we do that and insert this into a fertilized wolf's egg we may give birth to an animal that hasn't walked the earth since 1936 
the really neat thing about this stuff is that's life 
and in the measure that we learn how chickens grow wings and what the program is for those cells to differentiate one of the things we're going to be able to do is to stop undifferentiated cells which you know as cancer and one of the things we're going to learn how to do is how to reprogram cells like stem cells in such a way that they express bone stomach skin pancreas 
that's why sometimes a person's genes don't have to change a lot to get cancer 
same thing with receptin if you've got breast cancer 
and you can watch states rise and fall depending on their ability to speak a language of life and you can watch new york fall off a cliff and you can watch new jersey fall off a cliff and you can watch the rise of the new empires of intelligence 
that's why nations rise and fall 
in the 1990s these are sovereign states that did not exist before 1990 
and when noah had done built his ark i understand that somebody began to rend a song 
and the old lady said oh yes come on in 
it was great 
it's really amazing 
if you want to know about africa read our literature -- and not just things fall apart because that would be like saying i've read 'gone with the wind' and so i know everything about america 
we've had a lot of -- a parade of amazing ideas here 
but harry's wife is confused because she said you know harry had been packing his own lunch for 20 years 
so i had a very inventive teacher a pakistani muslim who wanted to teach us about this 
i mean picture this -- really picture this 
we are squandering the most valuable resource we have on this continent the valuable resource of the imagination 
and we want to say to idris chop him up 
shut him up 
the question is how do i balance narratives that are wonderful with narratives of wounds and self-loathing 
as a young middle-class nigerian activist i launched myself along with a whole generation of us into the campaign to stop the government 
i justified it and i said this is the cost of revolution 
have i not myself been imprisoned 
and so they said tell me about africa professor abani 
there are no essential africans and most of us are as completely ignorant as everyone else about the continent we come from and yet we want to make profound statements about it 
gazelle i killed you for your skin's exquisite touch for how easy it is to be nailed to a board weathered raw as white butcher paper 
rise and walk away like a panther 
also the person sitting in your very seats is a liar 
i watch that tv show 'lie to me' i know you're lying 
they use it to get to the truth and they do what mature leaders do everyday they have difficult conversations with difficult people sometimes during very difficult times 
its power emerges when someone else agrees to believe the lie 
deception is actually serious business 
it's woven into the fabric of our daily and our business lives 
koko was taught to communicate via sign language 
and i need to go back to work for the american people 
now if bill clinton had said well to tell you the truth   or richard nixon's favorite in all candor   he would have been a dead giveaway for any liespotter than knows that qualifying language as it's called qualifying language like that further discredits the subject 
freud had it right 
with body language here's what you've got to do 
now we're going to look at the hot spots 
we say yes we shake our heads no 
and we're going to see that in several videos moving forward but we're going to start -- for those of you who don't know him this is presidential candidate john edwards who shocked america by fathering a child out of wedlock 
but i'm happy to participate in one 
it's the only asymmetrical expression 
and these were surfaced by researcher david matsumoto in california 
and you'll see when you see the video she can't even pretend to be an agonizing mother 
diane downs at night when i close my eyes i can see christie reaching her hand out to me while i'm driving and the blood just kept coming out of her mouth 
now i'm going to show you a video of an actual grieving mother erin runnion confronting her daughter's murderer and torturer in court 
now the technology around what the truth looks like is progressing on the science of it 
i do now after learning about all the quantum stuff 
they fight they get back up you know wouldn't this be cool 
this is a clay maker 
you know how -- why would a kid want a dinosaur 
you can see how old this stuff is 
and i'm really not very good at it 
this is a -- you can see the little window there 
so this is a quick tale i'm going to tell this is the furby tale 
so this is my family 
i try to do a lot of philosophy a lot of thinking about all of these projects 
you can see the little bb in the box is my tilt sensor 
i just basically gnawed all this stuff out of plastic 
he didn't test so well but i like him 
and then she started doing these other images 
i have three girls and they just they -- it's like a rescue animal thing they're going there 
and on the weekend we ran the parts for that 
so this is how they come out close to the end 
for a while they were making two million furbys a month 
and she still actually has those 
and we're going to try to really pull this off intentfully try to make something that seems like it's alive 
and you could actually find full fossil evidence of these 
very very obsessive 
and then more sculpting and then more sculpting and then more sculpting and then more sculpting 
john do you want to bring him up 
yeah they're like kids you know 
that's what the investors think that it's just --  -- right right so they're really sweet little guys 
now these are not robots they're kind of lovebots you know 
we -- actually it's very hard to keep people from doing this 
and there's a lot of social responsibility in that 
if they can do that why can't governments and ngos do the same thing 
so that's why i took a bit of time to study coke 
they have this very continuous feedback loop 
they said you roll the ball you hear some pins go down 
it's dark you can't see which one goes down until the lights come on and then you an see your impact 
real-time data turns on the lights 
they set them up as what they called micro-distribution centers and those local entrepreneurs then hire sales people who go out with bicycles and pushcarts and wheelbarrows to sell the product 
the government noticed in ethiopia that many of the people were so far away from a health clinic they were over a day's travel away from a health clinic 
the third component of coke's success is marketing 
let's listen to this song that coke created for it wavin' flag by a somali hip hop artist 
and it went number one on the pop chart in 17 countries 
i've even seen it used for a chicken coop 
we know that circumcision reduces hiv infection by 60 percent in men 
but it turns out the men do because they're hearing from their girlfriends that they prefer it and the men also believe it improves their sex life 
so what's the endgame 
so if coke's marketers came to me and asked me to define happiness i'd say my vision of happiness is a mother holding healthy baby in her arms 
to me that is deep happiness 
thank you 
this is my baseline this is the mediterranean coast with no fish bare rock and lots of sea urchins that like to eat the algae 
this is their baseline this is what they think is natural because we started modern science with scuba diving long after we started degrading marine ecosystems 
what have we learned from these places 
when we went to pristine reefs we realized that the natural world was upside down this pyramid was inverted 
the top head does account for most of the biomass in some places up to 85 percent like kingman reef which is now protected 
then you go to palmyra atoll that has more biomass of herbivores and the dead corals are clean and the corals are coming back 
and this is what i saw lots of fish 
and this particular place the medes islands marine reserve is only 94 hectares and it brings 6 million euros to the local economy 20 times more than fishing and it represents 88 percent of all the tourist revenue 
these places when we protect them if we compare them to unprotected areas nearby this is what happens 
the abundance how many fish you have per square meter increases almost 170 percent 
if you fish less you're actually catching more 
another example nassau groupers in belize in the mesoamerican reef 
when i went there for the first time in 2000 there were only 3000 groupers left 
it happened in many places around the caribbean 
so how much of this do we have 
people are losing their jobs because the fisheries are collapsing 
the problem is that we can create these large reserves only in places where there are no people where there is no social conflict where the political cost is really low and the economic cost is also low 
but what about the rest of the coast of the world where people live and make a living out of fishing 
how could 85 percent survive on 15 percent 
the animals at the lower parts of the food chain they reproduce very fast they grow really fast they produce millions of eggs 
so really our picture of a food pyramid is just -- we have to change that completely 
we think this is universal 
so the numbers you presented really are astonishing 
talk to me about the feeling that you must have experienced of going to these pristine areas and seeing things coming back 
and if it were not for these places that show hope i don't think i could continue doing this job 
and the problem i think is that we take the ocean for granted 
most of the animals are in the oceans 
we use the submarine alvin and we use cameras and the cameras are something that bill lange has developed with the help of sony 
marcel proust said the true voyage of discovery is not so much in seeking new landscapes as in having new eyes 
it's got tentacles dangling swirling around like that 
and these are the types of animals that live in that three-dimensional space that micro-gravity environment that we really haven't explored 
they're very little understood 
they go from a couple of inches to a couple of feet 
it's footage that we've collected for scientific purposes 
and we're over the atlantic -- that's the ridge right there -- but we're going to go across the caribbean central america and end up against the pacific nine degrees north 
here's where bill's cameras really do shine 
and what you're seeing here is a cloud of densely packed hydrogen-sulfide-rich water coming out of a volcanic axis on the sea floor 
not only is it coming out of the earth -- so biogenesis made from volcanic activity -- but that bacteria supports these colonies of life 
a mile and a half from the surface to two miles to three miles -- no sun has ever gotten down here 
oh good going 
this is a female of this kind of worm 
you watch it doesn't take long before two guys here -- this one and one that will show up over here -- start to fight 
the red dot is the laser light of the submarine alvin to give us an idea about how far away we are from the vents 
it's actually a light-sensing organ 
this one's several stories tall 
this stuff is toxic as hell by the way 
that's probably where we evolved from 
there's a fish sitting here 
here's a crab with his claw right at the end of that tube worm waiting for that worm to stick his head out 
the worms are growing inches per week 
despite that these animals grow back in about a year's time 
learn to manage it 
so i'd like to talk about why that is why that's such a calamity for society what we can do about it and to close with why this is an amazing time to be a math teacher 
this is really destructive 
david milch creator of deadwood and other amazing tv shows has a really good description for this 
you expect sitcom-sized problems that wrap up in 22 minutes three commercial breaks and a laugh track 
in all seriousness here's an example from a physics textbook 
i'm sure we all agree that no problem worth solving is like that 
so i can diagnose the problem a little more specifically in math 
the math serves the conversation the conversation doesn't serve the math 
i like this question it's about a water tank 
i've got kids who are mathematically and conversationally intimidated joining the conversation 
we need more patient problem solvers thank you  
because actually radical innovation does sometimes come from the very best but it often comes from places where you have huge need -- unmet latent demand -- and not enough resources for traditional solutions to work -- traditional high-cost solutions which depend on professionals which is what schools and hospitals are 
we'll grow by six cities of 12 million people a year for the next 30 years 
this is where you'll find the fastest growing young populations of the world 
or you can go to places like this 
this is kibera which is the largest slum in east africa 
millions of people living here stretched over many kilometers 
they're private schools there are no state schools in slums 
it's not to do with electricity or water 
if you want to design from scratch virtually any service in africa you would start now with the mobile phone 
this is a place called the madangiri settlement colony which is a very developed slum about 25 minutes outside new delhi where i met these characters who showed me around for the day 
ten years ago they certainly would have been married 
this is the best you can get in hyderabad in indian education 
but they find it completely obvious to use computers websites make videos so on and so forth 
one is to deliver extrinsic motivation that education has a payoff 
that's too long if you're poor 
so you need education to be relevant and help people to make a living there and then often 
our education systems you do all that stuff afterward if you're lucky sport drama music 
so el sistema in venezuela uses a violin as a technology of learning 
taio rocha uses making soap as a technology of learning 
and i learned it from this guy who is an amazing character 
and it also supports working-class kids going into indian schools 
and it's the same wherever you go 
it's reliable and people know exactly where they are 
why can't we do it more like the chinese restaurants 
there are big picture schools in the us and australia 
but because so many of the issues in education aren't just in school they're in family and community what you also need definitely is more on the right hand side 
you need efforts to supplement schools 
that's an entire second adult lifetime that's been added to our lifespan 
but many people today -- philosophers artists doctors scientists -- are taking a new look at what i call the third act the last three decades of life 
they realize that this is actually a developmental stage of life with its own significance -- as different from midlife as adolescence is from childhood 
i've spent the last year researching and writing about this subject 
obviously there's no guarantee that it can be a time of fruition and growth 
it was about a man named neil selinger -- 57 years old a retired lawyer -- who had joined the writers group at sarah lawrence where he found his writer's voice 
it's a terrible disease it's fatal 
if however we can go back and alter our relationship re-vision our relationship to past people and events neural pathways can change 
i mean as girls we start off feisty -- yeah who says 
we have agency 
but very often many if not most of us when we hit puberty we start worrying about fitting in and being popular 
thank you very much 
but most species actually use insects to do their bidding and that's more intelligent in a way because the pollen they don't need so much of it 
the insects and other species can take the pollen transfer it directly to where it's required 
there are markings on many plants that look like other insects 
these are the anthers of a lily cleverly done so that when the unsuspecting insect lands on it the anther flips up and whops it on the back with a great load of pollen that it then goes to another plant with 
and basically what the insect has to do -- we're in the middle of the flower -- it has to stick its little proboscis right into the middle of that and all the way down that nectar tube to get to the nectar 
so not only has the fly not got the nectar from the mimic plant it's also -- if you look very closely just at the head end you can see that it's got a bit of pollen that it would be transmitting to another plant if only some botanist hadn't come along and stuck it to a blue piece of card 
and when the insect gets there and lands on it dousing itself in pollen of course that it's going to take to another plant if you look at the every-home-should-have-one scanning electron microscope picture you can see that there are actually some patterning there which is three-dimensional 
sometimes the whole plant mimics an insect even to us 
so flies love this 
they lay their eggs in it thinking it's a nice bit of carrion and not realizing that there's no food for the eggs that the eggs are going to die but the plant meanwhile has benefited because the bristles release and the flies disappear to pollinate the next flower -- fantastic 
this thing does something else which is unusual 
recently a wise media theorist tweeted the 19th century culture was defined by the novel the 20th century culture was defined by the cinema and the culture of the 21st century will be defined by the interface 
and i believe this is going to prove true 
and that's us down there in la and long beach on the bottom 
this is baron wolfgang von kempelen's mechanical chess playing machine 
and i think it's a pretty valid question 
he draws sheep after sheep 
so this is a clip from charlie chaplin's modern times 
that's all i'm getting paid for this 
so we resynthesized this song 
and then you'd do your best to recreate that with your own voice 
after previewing it and confirming it's what you submitted you could submit it into the mechanical turk with no other context 
i'm sorry for this 
and this was seen by a director in la named james frost who said wait a minute 
and i think one of my favorite parts of this project was not just shooting a video with lasers but we also open sourced it and we made it released as a google code project where people could download a bunch of the data and some source code to build their own versions of it 
so we thought this was the perfect project to build a collaborative memorial and a virtual resurrection for johnny cash 
collaborator five as much as is different from frame to frame it really is personal 
but there's a bunch of different styles 
there is a real problem with snobbery 
imagine that snobbery is a distinctively uk phenomenon fixated on country houses and titles 
snobbery is a global phenomenon 
now the opposite of a snob is your mother 
think this is somebody who is incredibly vulnerable and in need of love 
we're told from many sources that anyone can achieve anything 
we are now in a system where anyone can rise to any position they please 
they own their success but they also own their failure 
but i think it's insane to believe that we will ever make a society that is genuinely meritocratic it's an impossible dream 
what we fear is the judgment and ridicule of others and it exists 
and then are fit for ridicule 
now is there any alternative to this 
and that's why we enjoy looking at glaciers and oceans and contemplating the earth from outside its perimeters etc 
when banking is no longer so respectable we lose interest in banking 
but what i really want to stress is by all means success yes 
because the emphasis nowadays is so much on the justice of everything and politicians always talk about justice 
but it doesn't matter that much that we're putting too much emphasis on that 
thank you very much 
it's a smiling face 
and when i said i'm going to go out and do a 15-hour swim and we're coming into the dock after a long day and it's now night and we come in and it's 14 hours and 58 minutes and i can touch the dock and we're done the trainer says that's great 
try going in with an armada like we had of 50 people and five boats and cnn's crew etc 
and there are sharks 
and i gathered together honestly the world's leading experts in every possible way 
and a month ago the 23rd of september i stood on that shore and i looked across to that long long faraway horizon and i asked myself do you have it 
you're really left alone with your own thoughts 
first of all you're going to hit obstacles 
and even though you're feeling great at any one moment don't take it for granted be ready because there's going to be pain there's going to be suffering 
after a couple of days three days you tend to rebel in a lot of physical ways 
i don't know if you can still see the red line here and up the arm 
he's 29 years old very well-built lean he's six-foot five weighs 265 lbs and he is down 
i need help and i can't help diana 
the box jelly again -- all across the neck all across here 
we've got benadryl on board if i get stung i'll just grin and bear it 
and they have these long 30 to 40 to 50-ft tentacles 
henry what's your question 
and i said well it's odd that you've learned of this as a noble kind of pursuit but yeah i know those guys 
he said that's what you need 
thank you 
this hope is still alive 
are you going to swim the atlantic 
i said nope i didn't know 
and i left everything and went for a long series of odd jobs 
they come in a lot of different shapes 
so i'm always looking for the false cognates or identical words in different languages 
so i did a series of work where it was identical words in french and in english 
so if you don't know one of these languages it's instant learning 
it's all if 
and we can use them also as a safety net 
people tell me their lives their memories their aspirations and i create a mindscape 
i was also interested in the physicality of this format because you have to walk to see it 
so it's like the different layers of what we are made of and what we present to the world as an identity 
why do i call it a book 
after eight years of rejection i was thrilled to get my first commission with the percent for art in new york city 
here it's faceted glass in the bronx 
because if you sit a long time in summer in shorts you will walk away with temporary branding of the story element on your thighs 
it's a story about transformation and connections 
and here i've been working for the last three years with a south bronx developer to bring art to life to low-income buildings and affordable housing 
and i wanted to give them an escape 
but the result is always to have stories 
and you get to think about yourself and your memories and before you go back into suspension you edit your memories and you change your personality and so forth 
but lots of people now live to 90 or 100 unless they shake hands too much or something like that 
which by chimpanzee standards is very good indeed 
and i guess i better skip all the rest of this which are some details on how we might make those smart machines and --  -- and the main idea is in fact that the core of a really smart machine is one that recognizes that a certain kind of problem is facing you 
any guesses 1816 
what has changed our society has been wireless devices 
this is the first one this is an electrocardiogram 
in the future you're going to be checking all your vital signs all your vital signs your heart rhythm your blood pressure your oxygen your temperature etc 
if you're an expectant parent what about the ability to monitor continuously fetal heart rate or intrauterine contractions and not having to worry so much that things are fine as the pregnancy and moving over into the time of delivery 
and then as we go further today we have continuous glucose sensors 
i didn't have one of those but i got the fitbit 
of course how many here have any problems with sleeping 
and the wake time is in orange 
ok so that's the first night 
now diabetes is one of the big ones 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
one of the ones i just wanted to mention the ishoe is another example of a sensor that improves proprioception among the elderly to prevent falling 
one of them -- we're very fortunate -- is to develop a dedicated institute and that's work that started with the work that scripps with qualcomm  
the wireless institute the west wireless health institute is really the outgrowth of two extraordinary people who are here this evening gary and mary west and i'd like to give it up for them for getting behind this 
there's also a tremendous number of techniques that chefs have developed some about new aesthetics new approaches to food 
none of the techniques that these people have developed over the course of the last 20 years is in any of those books 
is there a way we can show people food in a way they have not seen it before 
then each of the different little pieces around it explain some fact 
well that first cutaway picture worked so we said okay let's do some more 
once you start cutting things in half you kind of get carried away so you see we cut the jars in half as well as the pan 
and each of these text blocks explains a key thing that's going on 
but to make them palatable we cut it out of a steel plate and put it in front of a fire and photographed it like this 
everybody knows that your various appliances have wattage right 
as it comes out of the grinder you just have a little tray and you just take it off in little passes build it up slice it vertically 
now watch closely this is popcorn i'll explain it here 
the popcorn is illustrating a key thing in physics 
but surgeons in these eras are a little bit more conservative than their bold trephinating ancestors 
and he is credited with doing over 4000 of these public surgeries wandering around in europe which is an astonishing number when you think that surgery must have been a last resort 
joseph lister was aepsis's or sterility's biggest advocate to a very very skeptical bunch of surgeons 
the mayo brothers came out to visit lister in europe 
something so simple 
laparoscopy is doing this kind of surgery surgery with long instruments through small incisions 
but there were casualties of this revolution 
they had to give up their wrists 
they had to give up intuitive motion in the instruments 
now what you put between those instruments and those hands is a large fairly complicated robot 
and since this was introduced in 1999 a lot of these robots have been out and being used for surgical procedures like a prostatectomy which is a prostate deep in the pelvis and it requires fine dissection and delicate manipulation to be able to get a good surgical outcome 
more useful than a solid gold surgeon but still it's a fairly big capital investment 
it has to be able to come off of the centerline and then be able to work back toward that centerline 
it's not so simple 
for the patient however it's transparent this is all they're going to see 
it's very exciting to think where we get to go with this 
as we take these capabilities and we get to go to the next places we get to decide what our new surgeries are going to be 
and i think to really get the rest of the way in that revolution we need to not just take our hands in in new ways we also need to take our eyes in in new ways 
we need to see beyond the surface 
you know for me the interest in contemporary forms of slavery started with a leaflet that i picked up in london 
and i'm going to admit to hubris 
it was mind-blowing 
but in fact that kind of bluey color are the countries where we can't find any cases of slavery 
well it builds up with these factors 
add in the increased vulnerability of very large numbers of people in the developing world caused by civil wars ethnic conflicts kleptocratic governments disease  you name it you know it 
but if corruption creeps in and people don't have the opportunity to have that protection of the rule of law then if you can use violence if you can use violence with impunity you can reach out and harvest the vulnerable into slavery 
all around the world i've been told an almost identical story 
they said that guy looked sketchy i was suspicious but my children were hungry 
we needed medicine 
ten miles 100 miles 1000 miles later they find themselves in dirty dangerous demeaning work 
africans and indians as usual south americans and eastern europeans in particular are on our buy list 
d interesting micheal bottom line what do you recommend 
kevin bales okay you figured it out that's a spoof 
slaves cost between 3000 to 8000 dollars in north america but i could take you places in india or nepal where human beings can be acquired for five or 10 dollars 
they key here is that people have ceased to be that capital purchase item and become like styrofoam cups 
you buy them cheaply you use them you crumple them up and then when you're done with them you just throw them away 
i've got to say one of the most exciting parts about my job is that i get to and i want to introduce you to one of those 
this is not james this is one of the kids that he works with 
and it can be done 
liberation and more importantly all the work that comes after liberation 
this is what liberation really looks like 
she said no because we've got hope now 
okay thank you so much 
despite the new york times' and vanity fair's best efforts recently they're not brothers  
this is actually a training film for a clown college that they had 
there is a picture of charles so let's watch the next clip 
but people live on this land 
so what we're going to see is some of the icons of eames furniture 
and i'm really here to talk about design 
and this is a little film i made about the making of the eames lounge chair 
because it just kind of you know doesn't get any more basic than that 
this is a relatively famous chair 
but doing these splints they learned a lot about the manufacturing process which was incredibly important to them 
i'm trying to show you too much because i want you to really get a broth of ideas and images 
this is a house that charles and ray designed 
my sister is chasing someone else it's not me 
although i endorse heartily the fact that he stole her diary it's not me 
the house is 1949 
and now i'm going to test you 
i hope you had a nice time at buddy's party 
and they honor events in the linear world from the fictional world 
and then embassy row is actually a historical site because in the kymaerican story this is where the parisian diaspora started where there embassy was 
and the town has really embraced it 
and you're kind of trapped in the texture of kymaerica 
and this is cranbrook i've got a real treat for you which is the first film that charles ever made 
and he made it for the 1939 faculty exhibition 
you want to learn how to make films go make a movie 
so my point is that this scope of vision this holistic vision of design was with them from the beginning 
it wasn't like oh we made some chairs and got successful 
so we're going to do the last clip 
and part of why this stuff is important and all the things that we do are important is that these are the ideas we need 
and working on the idea that the cheapest electric toaster would also be the simplest to reverse-engineer i went and bought the cheapest toaster i could find took it home and was kind of dismayed to discover that inside this object which i'd bought for just 349 pounds there were 400 different bits made out of a hundred-plus different materials 
can i come up and get some iron 
but after some nagging i got him to do that 
but instead of a bellows i had a leaf blower 
plastic is the defining feature of cheap electrical goods 
and you can actually make plastic from obviously oils which come from plants but also from starches 
so this is attempting to make potato starch plastic 
and it was looking good for a while but i left it outside because you had to leave it outside to dry and unfortunately i came back and there were snails eating the unhydrolyzed bits of potato 
so kind of out of desperation i decided that i could think laterally 
and there it is on the shelves 
i don't know if you could see but i was never able to make insulation for the wires 
they were trying to catch fish 
however the report focused on what had already occurred and offered no information on what to expect now 
voice 1 it's coming again voice 2 new wave 
you know if you think about something like google which essentially is relying on the collective intelligence of the web to seek out those sites that have the most valuable information -- we know that google does an exceptionally good job of doing that and it does that because collectively this disorganized thing we call the world wide web actually has a remarkable order or a remarkable intelligence in it 
but what the blogosphere offers is the possibility of getting at the kind of collective distributive intelligence that is out there and that we know is available to us if we can just figure out a way of accessing it 
a network is not just the product of its component parts 
it is something more than that 
and that phenomenon of piling on the existing links is one that is characteristic of the blogosphere particularly of the political blogosphere and it is one that essentially throws off this beautiful decentralized bottom-up intelligence that blogs can manifest in the right conditions 
when we talk about bottom-up decentralized phenomena the ant colony is the classic metaphor because no individual ant knows what it's doing but collectively ants are able to reach incredibly intelligent decisions 
but the pace of exponential growth is really what describes information technologies 
it makes a huge difference 
and moore's law was not the first paradigm to bring exponential growth to computing 
when that comes to an end we'll go to the sixth paradigm three-dimensional self-organizing molecular circuits 
the great depression made not a dent in this exponential progression 
and i was asked well aren't you nervous 
and the cost of a transistor cycle which is a measure of the price performance of electronics comes down about every year 
but that was really right on schedule 
communication technologies 50 different ways to measure this the number of bits being moved around the size of the internet 
some critics say oh well software is stuck in the mud 
when i was a student it was across campus now it's in our pockets 
all the intellectual property that is created and taught will be online and available and developed online in a collaborative fashion 
here is our founding meeting 
so we're very appreciative of the support we've gotten from both the intellectual leaders the high-tech leaders particularly google and nasa 
whole arm shoulder disarticulation 
not in an envelope of a human arm with 21 degrees of freedom from your shoulder to your fingertips 
you think it's bad to lose one arm 
we have 14 out of the 21 degrees of freedom you don't need the ones in the last two fingers 
a couple of weeks ago we took it down to walter reed which is unfortunately more in the news these days 
it's going to go inside something that we use in cat scans and mris of whatever is their good arm to make silicon rubber then coat it and paint it in 3d -- exact mirror image of their other limb 
this weighs 69 pounds 
now he's going to pick up a pen with his opposed thumb and index finger 
that's about 10 percent of our global needs and 100 percent of some island nations 
it all began when two scientists fred grassle and jesse ausubel met in woods hole massachusetts where both were guests at the famed oceanographic institute 
they in fact are an endangered species themselves 
so fishermen could only catch what they could either eat or sell that day 
but this is no laughing matter 
that's the sort of technology that's available today that really wasn't available even a decade ago 
and so for animals that come to the surface to breathe such as this elephant seal it's an opportunity to send data back to shore and tell us where exactly it is in the ocean 
for example the dark blue shows you where the elephant seal moved in the north pacific 
for animals that don't surface we have something called pop-up tags which collect data about light and what time the sun rises and sets 
geneticists have developed a similar tool called genetic barcoding 
and so they put this together a list of all the species where they're known to occur and it really seemed like a very esoteric scientific type of exercise 
so all of a sudden this labor of love for no obvious economic reason has become a critical piece of information in terms of how that system is going to recover how long it will take and how the lawsuits and the multi-billion-dollar discussions that are going to happen in the coming years are likely to be resolved 
you can do this on a global scale but you can also do it on a regional scale 
now while a lot of the species we discovered in the census are things that are small and hard to see that certainly wasn't always the case 
similarly this golden v kelp collected in alaska just below the low water mark is probably a new species 
this particular shrimp we've dubbed it the jurassic shrimp it's thought to have gone extinct 50 years ago -- at least it was until the census discovered it was living and doing just fine off the coast of australia 
now this little critter it's only about half a millimeter in size not terribly charismatic 
and we also found this spectacular yeti crab that lives near boiling hot hydrothermal vents at easter island 
that means 91 percent even after the census still remain to be discovered 
but the really intriguing thing about the microbes is just how diverse they are 
a single drop of seawater could contain 160 different types of microbes 
the other point i'd like to make about this is that this ocean's interconnected 
census scientists worked in the rain they worked in the cold they worked under water and they worked above water trying to illuminate the wondrous discovery the still vast unknown the spectacular adaptations that we see in ocean life 
so whether you're a yak herder living in the mountains of chile whether you're a stockbroker in new york city or whether you're a tedster living in edinburgh the oceans matter 
♫ i could show the world how to smile ♫ ♫ i could be glad all of the while ♫ ♫ i could turn the gray skies to blue if i had you ♫ ♫ i could leave the old days behind ♫ ♫ leave all my pals i’d never mind ♫ ♫ i could start my life all anew if i had you ♫ ♫ i could climb the snow-capped mountains ♫ ♫ sail the mighty ocean wide ♫ ♫ i could cross the burning desert if i had you by my side ♫ ♫ i could be a king dear uncrowned humble or poor rich or renowned ♫ ♫ there is nothing i couldn’t do if i had you ♫ thank you well thank you so much 
and there's a cause for that all right 
well it's been around for 2500 years 
and we do something different than what we did in the past we add kind of a modicum of intelligence to that 
if there are 15 operations you know that none of them work 
you've heard that word several times in the last four days and everyone's familiar with kuhnian paradigms 
and by the human spirit i don't mean anything divine i don't mean anything supernatural -- certainly not coming from this skeptic 
what i mean is this ability that each of us has to be something greater than herself or himself to arise out of our ordinary selves and achieve something that at the beginning we thought perhaps we were not capable of 
there has certainly been no argument about that in this room in the past four days 
so if we are to be the world's healer every disadvantaged person in this world -- including in the united states -- becomes our patient 
i would like to quote one of my own household gods 
think about it 
rudimentary animal has a nervous system swims around in the ocean in its juvenile life 
if you put a five year-old child's dexterity against the best robots of today the answer is simple the child wins easily 
when it comes to being dexterous it's not even clear what the algorithm is you have to solve to be dexterous 
but let me show you cutting-edge robotics 
now the americans in the audience will know all about cup stacking 
and it sounds like an easy problem 
so the old days before digital radio when you were tuning in your radio and you heard crrcckkk on the station you wanted to hear that was the noise 
so if you're lucky enough to be able to knock a small white ball into a hole several hundred yards away using a long metal stick our society will be willing to reward you with hundreds of millions of dollars 
but we're going to represent beliefs with probabilities 
but there's another source of information and that's effectively prior knowledge 
but you know that your senses are not perfect and therefore there's some variability of where it's going to land shown by that cloud of red representing numbers between 05 and maybe 01 
that information is available in the current shot but there's another source of information not available on the current shot but only available by repeated experience in the game of tennis and that's that the ball doesn't bounce with equal probability over the court during the match 
as we go around we learn about statistics of the world and lay that down but we also learn about how noisy our own sensory apparatus is and then combine those in a real bayesian way 
so that really means i have to make predictions of the future 
any discrepancy should hopefully be external 
so as i go around the world i'm making predictions of what i should get subtracting them off 
and we replay that to the other hand with a time delay 
and based on this illustration we really convinced ourselves in the field that the brain's making precise predictions and subtracting them off from the sensations 
so we were looking for a much more objective way to assess this phenomena 
so if they retaliate with the same force the first person will think it's been escalated 
now we don't work with children we don't work with hitting but the concept is identical 
we started with a motor with a little lever a little force transfuser 
so it re-shows the brain makes predictions and fundamentally changes the precepts 
but we've got a problem 
and there's a big gap between the task and the movement system 
i could choose these two paths out of an infinite number of paths 
maybe we don't all quite move the same way 
but there's noise added to this 
so if i pick the same command through many times i will get a different noisy version each time because noise changes each time 
and the fundamental idea is you want to plan your movements so as to minimize the negative consequence of the noise 
so you want to avoid big forces as one principle 
so we've shown that using this we can explain a huge amount of data -- that exactly people are going about their lives planning movements so as to minimize negative consequences of noise 
all the conversation stopped all the eyes turned to me 
and so what i'd like to do now is to tell you about what we've learned in those journeys 
they put smart skylights through their stores so they could harvest the daylight and reduce the lighting demands 
so let me tell you this when wal-mart achieves 20 percent energy reductions that's going to be a very big deal but i'm afraid it's not enough 
well bob said the most important thing we could do right now is to make it clear in sacramento california that we need a market-based system of mandates that's going to cap and reduce greenhouse gases in california 
here's a story about national policy that we could all learn from 
they'd run ethanol or ordinary gasoline 
so what's happened in brazil is they've replaced 40 percent of the gasoline consumed by their automotive fleet with ethanol 
so a team of berkeley researchers with 15 million dollars from the gates foundation is engineering designing a radical new way to make the key ingredient called artemisinin and they're going to make that drug 10 times cheaper 
well i'll tell you -- a lot 
second fact the president's new budget for renewable energy is barely a billion dollars in total 
third fact i bet you didn't know that there's enough energy in hot rocks under the country to supply america's energy needs for the next thousand years and the federal budget calls for a measly 20 million dollars of r&ampd in geothermal energy 
not enough to stabilize the climate 
not enough to keep the ice in greenland from crashing into the ocean 
we've got to make this economic so that all people and all nations make the right outcome the profitable outcome and therefore the likely outcome 
it is the mother of all markets you remember that internet 
she's like oh us i'm like okay all right that's cool 
and there's a dude selling these aftermarket weapons for lego because lego -- the danish -- no they're not into guns 
but the americans oh we'll make some guns for lego no problem 
and at a certain point you look around you're like whoa this is a really nerdy crowd 
i'm kind of into this stuff and i'm going to stop being embarrassed 
and so this is like this cad program where you build it 
i have to take a moment 
there's a whole gray market for lego thousands of home-based businesses 
let's see here 
that's 300 million years per minute 
so this is frozen water 
the most intriguing and puzzling measurement in my opinion we've obtained of mars was released earlier this year in the magazine science 
and what we're looking at is the presence of the gas methane ch4 in the atmosphere of mars 
that's because the northern hemisphere is the region of the ancient ocean basin 
and that's because the water protected the basin from being impacted by asteroids and meteorites 
here's hellas basin a very very different place geologically 
we addressed on the board the major questions that have not been answered 
and the result of our meeting was a robotic rocket-powered airplane we call ares 
and our goal is to inspire the american public who is paying for this mission through tax dollars 
how do we transport an airplane to mars 
and we have it in something called an aeroshell 
because we have tested ares model several models in a half a dozen wind tunnels at the nasa langley research center for eight years under mars conditions 
we're ready to go 
this is the ares team we have about 150 scientists engineers where we're working with jet propulsion laboratory goddard space flight center ames research center and half a dozen major universities and corporations in developing this 
thank you very much 
and my colleague james fowler and i have been studying for quite sometime what are the mathematical social biological and psychological rules that govern how these networks are assembled and what are the similar rules that govern how they operate how they affect our lives 
they actually diffuse through networks 
you could have friendship relationships sibling relationships spousal relationships co-worker relationships neighbor relationships and the like 
or their altruistic or their charitable giving behavior might be influenced by their coworkers or by their neighbors 
nicholas christakis b it's obvious 
and what we show here is -- like here -- very few people are affected more and more and more and up to here and here's the peak of the epidemic 
and if they nominate the party host as their friend that party host has a hundred friends therefore has more friends than they do 
so we thought we would exploit this idea in order to study whether we could predict phenomena within networks 
and also we had them [actively] email us a couple of times a week 
by monitoring the friends group we could get 16 days advance warning of an impending epidemic in this human population 
now in our case although it wasn't necessary we could also actually map the network of the students 
we're going to take daily cuts through the network for 120 days 
every dot is a person and every line represents a volume of calls between the people 
and in fact we are in the era of what i would call massive-passive data collection efforts 
they're all kinds of ways we can use massively collected data to create sensor networks to follow the population understand what's happening in the population and intervene in the population for the better 
one is quasi-active like the flu example i gave where we get some people to nominate their friends and then passively monitor their friends -- do they have the flu or not -- and then get warning 
they collect millions of points at a time with very high accuracy and very high resolution 
they were gone in an instant 
the royal tombs had been destroyed by suspected arson 
let me leave you with a final thought 
and that was that an american congresswoman named patricia schroeder from colorado met with a group of journalists 
it will refer you directly to your congressperson to your us senator to your governor where divestment legislation is pending 
for instance the referral of the crimes in darfur to the international criminal court which the bush administration doesn't like 
he moved with the headlines 
but uh-oh the killers are within the camps 
well if you denounce you're probably never going to get back in the room 
you're un-owned 
he started as somebody who would denounce harmdoers he would charge up to people who were violating international law and he would say you're violating this is the un charter 
all the great progress in this country with relation to our adversaries has come by going into the room 
there's going to be a lot of people 
but it never struck me as it did that moment because on that image was a woman trying to nurse her baby and she had no milk to nurse 
a hundred years ago we didn't 
at our time in history these images are out of place 
this is more than hiv/aids malaria and tuberculosis combined 
and here you see a brain scan of two children -- one who had adequate nutrition another neglected and who was deeply malnourished 
and so today we focus on not just passing out food but making sure the mothers have enough enrichment and teaching them about breastfeeding 
it doesn't need to be refrigerated it doesn't need water which is often lacking 
eighty percent of the people in the world have no food safety net 
and usually the institutions -- churches temples other things -- do not have the resources to provide a safety net 
and if you fill the cup with local agriculture from small farmers you have a transformative effect 
many kids in the world can't go to school because they have to go beg and find a meal 
it costs less than 25 cents a day to change a kid's life 
families need the help 
so is this a hopeless cause 
cameroon northern cameroon boom and bust cycles of hunger every year for decades 
food aid coming in every year when people are starving during the lean seasons 
you manage the village manages these warehouses 
and the food banks are growing 
we're seeing that now in the horn of africa where food prices are up 240 percent in some areas over last year 
the shopkeepers are hiring more people 
and they require that a third of that food come from the smallest farmers who would have no opportunity 
i've gone out there i've met with the small farmers who have built their livelihoods on the opportunity and platform provided by this 
you look at the cost-benefit analysis and my dream is to take this issue not just from the compassion argument but to the finance ministers of the world and say we cannot afford to not invest in the access to adequate affordable nutrition for all of humanity 
when a leader says not under my watch everything begins to change 
wfp's been able to leave 30 nations because they have transformed the face of hunger in their nations 
not only that transforming hunger is an opportunity but i think we have to change our mindsets 
what's exciting is that over the last two or three years the government has spent 400 million dollars and they've allocated another billion dollars to what we call the cancer genome atlas project 
the cancer genome atlas is coming out now 
there's also a field of proteomics that i'll talk about in a few minutes which i think is going to be the next level in terms of understanding and classifying disease 
cancer is an interaction of a cell that no longer is under growth control with the environment 
the goal of me as a cancer doctor is not to understand cancer 
you know if i measured your temperature over 30 days and i asked what was the average temperature 
i mean this is a scary slide not to take an aside but it looks at obesity in the world 
so our systems today are dramatically different than our systems a decade or two ago 
that is the most effective cost-effective best way we can do things today 
sounds are affecting your hormone secretions all the time but also your breathing your heart rate -- which i just also did -- and your brainwaves 
it has the frequency of roughly 12 cycles per minute 
there are eight expressions of a brand in sound 
you all recognize that one  this is the most-played tune in the world today 
why are we doing this 
the first is it's essential for us to understand the human brain if we do want to get along in society and i think that it is a key step in evolution 
and you may think that anesthetics work by sending you into some deep sleep or by blocking your receptors so that you don't feel pain but in fact most anesthetics don't work that way 
99 percent of what you see is not what comes in through the eyes 
they are highly reactive and they are super-plastic and so the autists are probably capable of building and learning a symphony which is unthinkable for us 
they choose very carefully who they connect with 
and we did that for tens of thousands of neurons built digital models of all the different types of neurons we came across 
and we think this is species-specific which means that that could explain why we can't communicate across species 
so let's switch it on but to do it what you have to do is you have to make this come alive 
there literally are only a handful of equations that you need to simulate the activity of the neocortex 
here we activate it and this gives the first glimpse of what is happening in your brain when there is a stimulation 
we can ask where is it inside if we stimulate it with a picture 
fifty years ago when i began exploring the ocean no one -- not jacques perrin not jacques cousteau or rachel carson -- imagined that we could do anything to harm the ocean by what we put into it or by what we took out of it 
i want to share with you my personal view of changes in the sea that affect all of us and to consider why it matters that in 50 years we've lost -- actually we've taken we've eaten -- more than 90 percent of the big fish in the sea why you should care that nearly half of the coral reefs have disappeared why a mysterious depletion of oxygen in large areas of the pacific should concern not only the creatures that are dying but it really should concern you 
i'm haunted by the thought of what ray anderson calls tomorrow's child asking why we didn't do something on our watch to save sharks and bluefin tuna and squids and coral reefs and the living ocean while there still was time 
for me as a scientist it all began in 1953 when i first tried scuba 
since then i've used about 30 kinds of submarines and i've started three companies and a nonprofit foundation called deep search to design and build systems to access the deep sea 
and i'm living proof 
no matter where on earth you live 
over time most of the planet's organic carbon has been absorbed and stored there mostly by microbes 
you did a great job with the land the dirt 
we need new deep-diving submarines 
that's bad news for us too 
we're putting hundreds of millions of tons of plastic and other trash into the sea 
millions of tons of discarded fishing nets gear that continues to kill 
we're still killing bluefin tuna truly endangered and much more valuable alive than dead 
using google earth you can witness trawlers -- in china the north sea the gulf of mexico -- shaking the foundation of our life support system leaving plumes of death in their path 
together we had just broken the world speed record for a trek to the south pole 
now many of you are probably saying wait a sec is this tough to do 
you'll be in a massive headwind 
virtually none all of our equipment including film equipment was charged by the sun 
look at that central building right in the middle of the picture that's the 130-foot diameter library that is exactly the size of the base of the spaceship 
two days later the space traveler's manifesto explaining why -- just like we heard yesterday -- why we need to go into space trips to satellites of the outer planets august 20 1958 
and that's why when you get something declassified that's what it looks like  
this is ed day putting  so each of these coffee cans has three pounds of c4 in it 
so thanks to him 
and now we have ground hazard assessments when you have a blow-up on the pad 
this is the kind of stuff that's not been declassified just that people managed to sneak home and after you know on their deathbed basically gave me 
and one part of nasa was interested in it but the headquarters in nasa they killed the project 
so finally at the end we can see the thing followed its sort of design path right up to 1965 and then all those paths came to a halt 
and it turned out to be quite fun in two ways 
and to the extent you believe i didn't shrink the lines which i didn't i've proven to you that your eyes were deceiving you 
right it's impossible to overcome this sense that this is indeed longer 
turns out that they got to 28 percent after mailing every household in the country a letter begging people to join this organ donation program 
when you walk into the dmv the person who designed the form will have a huge influence on what you'll end up doing 
what do you do do you pull the patient back and try ibuprofen 
the other group of the physicians they said yesterday when you reviewed the case you discovered there were two medications you didn't try out yet ibuprofen and piroxicam 
now think of it this decision makes it as easy to let the patient continue with hip replacement 
the thing is is that no physician would ever say piroxicam ibuprofen hip replacement 
an online subscription for 59 dollars 
these are the market share most people wanted the combo deal 
the answer was absolutely yes 
now you're getting it 
and we also have more than five billion of these devices here 
these 14 million cellular radio masts or base stations consume a lot of energy 
and that creates a big problem 
it's good for a nice suntan but otherwise dangerous for the human body 
and multiply that by 10000 then you end up at 14 billion 
not usable for a youtube video 
and the light goes through that hole 
and that signal is then converted back to a high-speed data stream 
and not only integrate a photo detector here but maybe use the camera inside 
so what happens when i switch on that light 
but at the same time you see this video coming up here 
so no one if i have a light here if i have secure data no one on the other side of this room through that wall would be able to read that data 
so for me the applications of it to me are beyond imagination at the moment 
and they use light to illuminate space down there 
if you saw 2001 a space odyssey and you heard the boom boom boom boom and you saw the monolith you know that was arthur c clarke's representation that we were at a seminal moment in the evolution of our species 
and you know we in the last 30 years in particular have seen this acceleration in knowledge and technology and technology has bred more knowledge and given us tools 
and we've seen many seminal moments 
you're walking around your car has 12 microprocessors 
then we go along and create the internet and connect the world together we flatten the world 
the dna is organized in words call them genes and chromosomes 
dna is a very elegant molecule 
this here is a bug in my genome that i have struggled with for a long long time 
what is the code 
then you can go about the process of trying to fix it and figure it out 
for my wife eat three times as much and you never put on any weight 
it's all hidden in this code and it's starting to be understood at breakneck pace 
we can understand for example why we create plaque in our arteries what creates the starchiness inside of a grain why does yeast metabolize sugar and produce carbon dioxide 
we can also look at at a grander scale what creates problems what creates disease and how we may be able to fix them 
now you have the genome and you say to yourself so if i plug this synthetic genome -- if i pull the old one out and plug it in -- does it just boot up and live 
and this is extremely profound 
so then what do you do 
we can start to figure that out 
and he had the best answer i ever heard to this question well somebody has to 
you cannot compete with the environment if you have an adolescent dog's brain 
go on something should happen now 
no we go puppy sit -- boom it's got it in six to 10 trials 
he'll find jamie wherever he is you know wherever kids are crushing rocks by a stream or something and take him a little message that says hey dinner's ready come in for dinner 
so at this point the dog knows what we want it to do 
the dog lives with you the dog can get you any time 
so the second stage in training is to teach the dog to want to do what we want him to do and this is very easy 
and what we're doing in essence is we're teaching the dog kind of like -- we're letting the dog think that the dog is training us 
and now the dog's really happy 
there's several definitions of what a punishment is but one definition the most popular is a punishment is a stimulus that reduces the immediately preceding behavior such that it's less likely to occur in the future 
the dog is actually euthanized now but this was a dog i worked with for a while 
when the dog would try to leave the mat she would say rover on the mat on the mat on the mat 
how are you going to reprimand a grizzly bear 
rover come here rover come here you son of a bitch 
and i went oh my god do i do something 
the husband won't clear up his clothes or the wife's always late for meetings whatever it is ok 
you see it especially in the workplace especially from boss to employee 
and this i would say is the biggest human foible that we have 
your kids are easy to train 
we think how we do it -- one night in bed we're pregnant and then we're raising the most important thing in life a child 
and it concludes in something that you see here that you actually wouldn't expect as being the result of rationality 
i call it sort of shotgun flexibility 
so what you're seeing now is actually the design of the building 
so that was the core idea 
so once we had presented that back to them they agreed that this sort of core concept could work 
the things on the -- on the left-hand side of the diagram those are the boxes 
that skin serves double duty again for economics 
so it's an unusual building for a public library obviously 
that was the main sort of technology area in the building 
you dizzy yet 
and it allowed us to go back to first principles and redefine fly tower acoustic enclosure light enclosure and so forth 
they came to us and they said -- unlike normal developers -- they said we want to start out by providing a contemporary art museum in louisville that's our main goal 
and so instead of being a developer that sees an opportunity to make money they saw an ability to be a catalyst in their downtown 
and that pro forma led us to a mixed-use building that was very large in order to support their aspirations of the art but it also opened up opportunities for the art itself to collaborate interact with commercial spaces that actually artists more and more want to work within 
and there is a pedestrian corridor that they wanted to add that would link a series of cultural buildings and a view corridor -- because this is the historic district -- that they didn't want to obstruct with the new building 
it also means that if an artist wants to invade something like a swimming pool they can begin to do their exhibition in a swimming pool so they're not forced to always work within the confines of a contemporary gallery space 
ok now you're 19 now 
and i tried and i made it 
and you made it out of what 
and so and that windmill what -- it worked 
yeah 
so what did they make of -- that you were 14 15 at the time -- what did they make of this they were impressed 
yeah 
so that would produce irrigation for the entire village 
because it gets into all sorts of crazy realms 
♫ this is a loop feedback loop ♫ ♫ this is a loop feedback loop ♫ ♫ this is a loop feedback loop ♫ ♫ this is a loop feedback loop ♫ ♫ this is a loop feedback loop ♫ ♫ this is a loop feedback loop ♫ ♫ this is a --  all right i don't know if that was necessary to demonstrate --  -- but my point is it's the sound of self-destruction 
there seems to be a rule in nature that if you get too close to where you came from it gets ugly 
the oil was running out and a nuclear winter would finish us off 
it just tells you they were both designed to fit the human hand 
homo erectus made the same tool for 30000 generations 
of course there were a few changes but tools changed slower than skeletons in those days 
it's an extraordinary phenomenon but it's true 
and more than that it's a confection of different ideas the idea of plastic the idea of a laser the idea of transistors 
one goes extinct for the other to survive 
so what sex does is it enables the individual to draw upon the genetic innovations of the whole species 
so oz is better at both spears and axes than adam 
ask yourself how long you would have to work to provide for yourself an hour of reading light this evening to read a book by 
and that's seven and a half seconds of prosperity that you've gained since 1950 as it were because that's seven and a half seconds in which you can do something else or you can acquire another good or service 
they were a highly intelligent species 
the reason because tierra del fuego is separated from south america by a much narrower straight and there was trading contact across that straight throughout 10000 years 
the tasmanians were isolated 
it's not the same with language 
with language we have to transfer ideas that we understand with each other 
there will be wars there will be depressions there will be natural disasters 
my work is about the behaviors that we all engage in unconsciously on a collective level 
and as individuals we all do these things all the time everyday 
it's like when you're mean to your wife because you're mad at somebody else 
or when you overeat because your feelings are hurt or whatever 
that's 15 minutes of our cup consumption 
and if you could actually stack up that many cups in real life that's the size it would be 
i wanted to make a piece that shows the actual number of americans who die from cigarette smoking 
and we aren't talking about it -- we dismiss it 
and strangely enough the only plastic surgery that is more popular than breast augmentation is liposuction and most of that is being done by men 
my belief is that you don't have to make yourself bad to look at these issues 
how can we investigate this flora of viruses that surround us and aid medicine 
but evolution is a balance where you have fast change you also have ultra-conservation -- things that almost never change 
and so we looked into this a little more carefully and i'm going to show you data now 
down here you can see slower evolution less diversity 
ok so that's what we did but how are we going to do that 
if you've got enough money to buy just a camry you can build one of these too and so we put a deep how-to guide on the web totally free with basically order-off-the-shelf parts 
and so what we did -- and this is a really cool project -- we just started by making a respiratory virus chip 
that's the scourge of daycare centers everywhere -- it's like boogeremia basically 
and so it is not any one stripe or something that tells me i have a virus of a particular type here it's the barcode that in bulk represents the whole thing 
that's me getting a nasal lavage 
actually we thought the nasal tract might be full of viruses even when you're walking around healthy 
so that's great but again cheap shot right 
so we built out the chip 
now we're using this chip and what are we using it for 
and this is what this looks like 
and that is in fact what these particular cell cultures are chronically infected with 
so let's do something a little bit harder 
they did a ct scan 
switch antibiotics so they switched to another antibiotic tamiflu 
there's almost no epidemiology or studies on it 
and why is that just lore there's no data -- no data to support whether it causes severe or mild disease 
it doesn't make sense -- unless maybe there's a virus 
and this is a little phylogenetic tree to see how it's related to other viruses 
is it the case that these guys are just more susceptible to viruses 
this was all done by folks in the lab -- i cannot take credit for most of this 
i'm talking about the production of aluminum 
the electrolyte is not a solution of salt and water but rather salt that's melted 
so now how to choose the metals 
i felt the thrill of realization when i knew i'd come upon the answer 
it's pretty cool at least in theory 
we go to the laboratory 
no i hire a student and mentor him teach him how to think about the problem to see it from my perspective and then turn him loose 
and i was able to attract really really good people people who share my passion for science and service to society not science and service for career building 
i went to aspen recently and stumbled into this song 
♫ black men go to aspen ♫ ♫ and rent colorful chalets ♫ ♫ giggle at the questions ♫ ♫ their mere presence seems to raise ♫ ♫ get taken for men ♫ ♫ we don't resemble in the least ♫ are you   
and since they discovered those things it really stuck with them so much more and also they would experience their own failures there was a failure-based aspect to learning there it was very important 
and another thing that really impressed me a long time ago was powers of ten charles and ray eames' film 
and so i'm going to show you a toy today that i've been working on that i think of more than anything else as kind of a philosophy toy 
now we actually play through many generations here at the cellular scale 
but basically this is the editor where we're going to design the next generation of our creature so it has a little spine 
but really the goal here was within about a minute i wanted somebody to replicate what typically takes a pictorial artist several weeks to create 
ok now i'll put some hands on it 
and i can see how it might dance 
i can also play with the dynamics of this world over time 
and our cities are going to be at risk too because a lot of these are coastal cities 
here it is some indigenous life down here 
you see now they've actually gone to tribal dynamics 
i think i'll leave before they get hostile 
but these are the things that we can kind of put in this little galaxy here 
because i think most of the problems that our world is facing right now is the result of short-term thinking and the fact that it is so hard for us to think 50 100 or 1000 years out 
and so i'm going to talk a little bit about that keeping in mind that we have a lot on the program here 
what's in it for the ant 
no it's worse than that 
there are a lot of ideas to die for 
the secret of happiness is find something more important than you are and dedicate your life to it 
actually i think we're all responsible for not just the intended effects of our ideas but for their likely misuses 
so let me just point out memes are like viruses 
and you might think well how can that be 
they're made of information and can be carried in any physical medium 
not just the priests everybody 
after all the meme for shaker-dom was essentially a sterilizing parasite 
but among all those ideas that inevitably flow out into the whole world thanks to our technology are a lot of toxic ideas 
and it's not our fault anymore than it's our fault when our germs lay waste to people that haven't developed the immunity 
we drove to the goodwill and we threw the sweater away somewhat ceremoniously my idea being that i would never have to think about the sweater nor see it ever again 
i tell that story because it has served and continues to serve as a metaphor to me about the level of connectedness that we all have on this earth 
it's thrilling 
first she talked about comfort status beauty 
and we've started making curtains and not only is it beautiful but people can see status -- that you care about your children 
thank you 
my job depends upon it 
up to and around about the second world war conductors were invariably dictators -- these tyrannical figures who would rehearse not just the orchestra as a whole but individuals within it within an inch of their lives 
let's be under no illusions 
simply through singing 
so we got some shows off the ground we started touring them internationally 
one of them was carmen 
i want to play you a tiny clip of it now for no other reason than to give you proof positive that there is nothing tiny about south african music making 
they don't read music 
and yet ladies and gentlemen every single one of us on this planet probably engages with music on a daily basis 
i've got a little experiment i want to try with you 
t see it's the same as f in music 
there i am like a bloody windmill again you see 
the music will start and then at a signal from me you will sing that 
one more time with feeling ladies and gentlemen 
it's going to be britain's first ever national disabled orchestra 
clarence i would rather be able to play an instrument again than walk 
i only wish that some of those musicians were here with us today so you could see at firsthand how utterly extraordinary they are 
if any of you thinks you want to help me in any way to achieve what is a fairly impossible and implausible dream still at this point please let me know 
haydn remonstrated with the prince but to no avail

seventeen doesn't divide by two 
the wise old woman thought about their problem for a long time and finally she came back and said well i don't know if i can help you but at least if you want you can have my camel 
they had one camel left over 
now if you think about that story for a moment i think it resembles a lot of the difficult negotiations we get involved in 
as i've spent the last better part of three decades almost four traveling the world trying to work getting involved in conflicts ranging from yugoslavia to the middle east to chechnya to venezuela some of the most difficult conflicts on the face of the planet i've been asking myself that question 
so how do they deal with their differences 
but what we don't often see is that there's always a third side and the third side of the conflict is us it's the surrounding community it's the friends the allies the family members the neighbors 
perhaps the most fundamental way in which the third side can help is to remind the parties of what's really at stake 
and we met in the hague in the peace palace in the same room where the yugoslav war crimes tribunal was taking place 
and then he went on and then he turned to me and said you're an american 
now i don't pretend to have an answer to the middle east conflict but i think i've got a first step literally a first step something that any one of us could do as third-siders 
and so my question is yes let's try and resolve the politics there in the middle east but let's also take a look at the story 
let's see if we can apply the third side to it 
what would that mean what is the story there 
now as anthropologists we know that every culture has an origin story 
that man of course was abraham 
what's the opposite of terrorism 
it's taking an innocent stranger and treating them as a friend whom you welcome into your home in order to sow and create understanding or respect or love 
and that's what comes to the first step here 
that's the essence of the abraham path 
so what we discovered is that abraham is not just a figure out of a book for those people 
and just a couple weeks ago there was an npr story on it 
and they quoted a villager who said this walk connects us to the world 
she's partially blind her husband can't work she's got seven kids 
and so more and more walkers have come and lately she's begun to earn an income to support her family 
so my question is if it can be done in europe why not in the middle east 
that's walking abraham's path 
after a tedtalk why not a tedwalk 
there's an old african proverb that goes when spider webs unite they can halt even the lion 
if we're able to unite our third-side webs of peace we can even halt the lion of war 
well what is needed for the earliest possible warning of a heart attack 
a means to determine if there's a complete blockage of a coronary artery 
and if we had a computer put into the body of a person who's at risk we could know before they even have symptoms that they're having a heart attack to save their life 
and what we tried with the pig was external electrodes on the skin like you see in an emergency room and i'm going to show you why they don't work very well 
next to it at 30 seconds you see this rise here then this rise -- that's the st elevation 
then on friday at 643 he began to get certain signs which later we had the pig run around -- i'm not going to go into this early stage 
finally if you're lucky you are treated in three or four hours after the incident but the heart muscle has died 
and now i want to talk about something entirely different 
so here's a picture of what we're doing 
there's this migraine that is preceded by a visual aura and this visual aura by the way -- and i'll show you a picture -- but it sort of begins with little dancing lights gets bigger and bigger until it fills your whole visual field 
christina sidebottom well my first reaction was that it was -- looked awfully gun-like and it was very strange 
the most severe headaches responded better after we did it several times and the unexpected finding indicates that even established headaches not only those with aura get treated and get diminished 
well responsive electrical stimulation means that we sense at a place in your brain which is called an epileptic focus which is where the epileptic seizure begins -- we sense there that it's going to happen and then we respond by applying an electrical energy at that spot which erases the errant signal so that you don't get the clinical manifestations of the migraine headache 
that concludes my discussion of epilepsy which is the third invention that i want to discuss here this afternoon 
we want to have some people who really know how to do this perform human engineering studies to develop the optimum design for the portable device for treating migraine headaches 
and that is the second wish 
we needed to take what we had built and create a platform out of it so that it could be used elsewhere in the world 
and so there is a team of developers from all over africa who are part of this team now -- from ghana from malawi from kenya 
what is the veracity level of what you're looking at 
so you've got a lot of information that's great 
take the crowd and apply them to the information 
and we are very happy to be part of the ted family 
it's inevitable terrible but really what i want to talk about is i'm just fascinated by the legacy people leave when they die 
a value for things with a personal touch -- an autograph book a soul-searching letter 
if a fraction of this powerful ted audience could be inspired to buy a beautiful paper -- john it'll be a recycled one -- and write a beautiful letter to someone they love we actually may start a revolution where our children may go to penmanship classes 
so what do i plan to leave for my son 
i plan to publish my own notebook 
i have no idea how i'm going to do it but i am committed to compiling his thoughts and mine into a book and leave that published book for my son 
what's happened in the music world is there's a culture or an ecosystem that's been created that if you take some words from apple the catchphrase that we create rip mix and burn 
and what that's done is it's created like i said a vibrant community that's very inclusive with people continually working to connect musical ideas innovate them and keep things constantly up to date 
imagine making it free so that anyone in the world can have access to all of this knowledge and imagine using information technology so that you can update this content improve it play with it on a timescale that's more on the order of seconds instead of years 
in fact a lot of this use coming from unites states k-through-12 schools because anyone who's involved in a school scale back the first thing that's cut is the music curriculum and so this is just indicating the tremendous thirst for this kind of open free content 
we've been working with amd which has a project called 50 by '15 which is trying to bring internet connectivity to 50 percent of the world's population by 2015 
in particular a bunch of the projects that are funded by hewlett foundation who have taken a real leadership role in this area of open content 
ok burn i think this is sort of quite interesting 
how much would it cost in a bookstore 
why does it cost 22 dollars 
remember we took the book tore the pages out 
imagine music xml that actually lets you delve into the semantic structure of music play with it understand it 
even the three wise men 
because we're saying that anybody can contribute things to this commons anybody can contribute anything 
so thanks very much 
i've been at mit for 44 years i went to ted i 
everybody agrees that whatever the solutions are to the big problems they include education sometimes can be just education and can never be without some element of education 
so with those as the principles -- some of you may know seymour papert this is back in 1982 when we were working in senegal 
here we're in the '80s 
and these kids their first english word is google and they only know skype they've never heard of telephony 
screw you go to the back of the line and someone else will do it and then when you figure out that this works you can join as well 
and the idea is to launch with enough scale that the scale itself helps bring the price down and that's why i said seven to 10 million there 
now once people start looking at this they say ah this is a laptop project 
because laptop economics are the following i say 50 percent here it's more like 60 60 percent of the cost of your laptop is sales marketing distribution and profit 
ok i've been using laptops since their inception 
the dual mode display -- the idea is to have a display that both works outdoors -- isn't it fun using your cell phone outdoors in the sunlight 
and in about 30 days we'll know for sure whether this works 
probably the most important piece there is that the kids really can do the maintenance 
so this is just a mechanical engineering sort of embodiment of it for you to play with 
everybody thinks they know about education a lot of culture is built into it as well 
well guess what we're not 
because there's no market for post office trucks 
you can spray paint it you can do anything you want 
that came from a 1960 paper on space travel because if you think about it space is pretty awkward 
he said no no no here's a better way 
and he said well okay 
and if you were able to print out everybody in your cell phone the room would be very crowded 
these are the people that you have access to right now in general -- all of these people all of your friends and family that you can connect to 
but when you actually visualize it all the connections that we're doing right now -- this is an image of the mapping of the internet -- it doesn't look technological 
it actually looks very organic 
it's that they're helping us to be more human helping us to connect with each other 
we're just increasing our humanness and our ability to connect with each other regardless of geography 
so that's why i study cyborg anthropology 
and people are initially reluctant to tell you 
we talk about things in relative terms 
and so when we look at these pmtct programs what does it mean 
imagine yourself if you can you're a young woman in africa you're going to the hospital or clinic 
and you don't know who you can talk to because the truth is hiv is so stigmatizing that if you partner your family anyone in your home you're likely to be thrown out without any means of support 
and this -- this is the face and story of hiv in africa today 
but we're here to talk about possible solutions and some good news 
our organization mothers2mothers enlists women with hiv as care providers 
but if you wanted to understand what that surgery would do to your life you'd like to engage someone someone who's had the procedure 
and so doctors and nurses -- they look up to them as experts 
men are not frequently part of pregnancy care 
and this is so important in breaking through the stigma 
and if we can change enough communities we can change national attitudes 
we have the medicines we have the tests but how do you reduce the stigma 
i've been afraid to tell everybody 
how do you build a better health care system 
and our organization helps women across that bridge 
the program is now working in nine countries we have 670 program sites we're seeing about 230000 women every month we're employing 1600 mentor mothers and last year they enrolled 300000 hiv-positive pregnant women and mothers 
all of this is possible if we each contribute to this fight 
thank you 
then they irradiate our food trying to make it last longer so it can travel thousands of miles from where it's grown to the supermarkets 
this man joel salatin they call him a lunatic farmer because he grows against the system 
since i'm home-schooled i went to go hear him speak one day 
i want you to know that there are farmers' markets in every community popping up 
not too long ago my uncle said that he offered my six-year-old cousin cereal 
now we had a harvard professor here -- she was from harvard i just wanted to mention and -- and she was actually a professor from harvard 
the scales here are religiosity from zero percent or atheist to 100 percent bible literally true 
now let's talk about some of the characteristics that are important for this revolutionary device 
first of all it needs to be small 
now i bought this device from clifford stoll for about 900 bucks 
free bird 
ok one more time -- i'm just going to give you a little help 
and finally we're going to put the marriott hotel and the portola plaza on the top 
mr vice president i wish i knew how to quit you 
and sylvia earle and i were on an expedition in this submarine 20 years ago in japan 
but when i got there i found lots of plastic garbage and other debris 
it's in the mid-pacific it's about five days from anywhere 
so that's when i first learned of the islands and had no idea what i was getting into 
it's a very deep-water part of our planet 
but we got up there and i had the unique and wonderful scientific opportunity and personal opportunity to get to a place that had never been dived and just get to an island and go okay where are we going to dive 
let's try there and then falling into the water 
the phoenix islands and all the equatorial parts of our planet are very important for tuna fisheries especially this yellowfin tuna that you see here 
so i thought the scenes of never-ending wilderness would go on forever but they did finally come to an end 
they basically are one nation that controls most of the equatorial waters of the central pacific ocean 
and for some reason they didn't want me to come or it was hard to find a time and a place and it took a while but finally they said okay you can come 
and i was free for dinner and i went out to dinner with the minister of fisheries in kiribati 
it had occurred on land in rainforests of south america and africa where landowners had been paid not to cut the trees down 
so we had very strong leadership very good vision and a lot of science a lot of lawyers involved 
so suddenly we had this area that we were protecting but now it appeared to be dead at least in the coral areas 
and that's the story with climate-change heating 
and we are now in the process of raising the full endowment 
and i actually went to see some of the design companies in hong kong in my stay there 
and i'll just give you one example i had gotten my first walkman 
last november a museum opened in tokyo called the mori museum in a skyscraper up on the 56th floor 
and for sure i haven't looked at the sky in the same way after spending an hour in there 
you know one is just working without pressure 
this is you know related to it getting out of the studio 
again we could supply the content for it 
icons like batman superman wonder woman and their colleagues will be teaming up with icons jabbar noora jami and their colleagues 
as christian iconography got changed and swastikas were created out of crucifixes batman and superman were created by jewish young men in the united states and canada also going back to the bible 
superman is not only sent to earth from the heavens or krypton but he's sent in a pod much like moses was on the nile 
so 33 of the stones are smuggled onto the nina the pinta and the santa maria and are spread in the new world 
to which he said let them be because what they're giving us is worth a lot more than what we're paying them 
so these 99 stones a few kind of rules in the game number one you don't choose the stone the stone chooses you 
well  
we have jabbar from saudi who starts breaking things when he has the power 
i'm like are all the girls going to be kind and merciful and the guys all strong 
that's not timely 
and that led to all kinds of things from being in curricula in universities and schools to -- one of my favorite pictures i have from south asia it was a couple of men with long beards and a lot of girls wearing the hijab -- it looked like a school 
opened a theme park through a license in kuwait a year and a half ago called the 99 village theme park -- 300000 square feet 20 rides all with our characters a couple back-to-school licenses in spain and turkey 
rughal there must be something we can do 
dr razem it's time to go miklos 
you are noora the light 
i don't deserve it i don't deserve anything 
jabbar we're here to help you 
miklos no he gave me access and you want to reboot the [unclear] no more [unclear] 
as the father of five sons i worry about who they're going to be using as role models 
and torture's a terrible enough thing as it is but when it's done by your hero that just breaks you in so many ways 
now one of the things that i refer to when i -- about the importance of this message -- is that i gave a lecture at the medical school at kuwait university where i lecture on the biological basis of behavior and i gave the students two articles one from the new york times and one from new york magazine 
any boys and girls caught flirting would get married off immediately okay 
the second one took place in upstate new york 
she was actually coming out of an amnesty international meeting 
and the good news is there might be an easy solution to that and that's using our eyes more 
and it mushroomed slightly afghanistan and iraq mushroomed now to 3000 billion 
so there it is 227 billion is what africa owes 
and the recent financial crisis how much of this diagram might that figure take up 
we need to imagine what a landscape of the world's fears might look like 
this is mountains out of molehills a timeline of global media panic 
and there's a very interesting and odd pattern hidden in this data that you can only see when you visualize it 
let me show you this 
i'll take answers 
i wonder if i could make my life beautiful 
it's the language of the eye 
but of course china has an enormous population 
and if it can do that maybe it can also change your behavior 
but what it points to is that visualizing information like this is a form of knowledge compression 
so heart is filtered out so i can see if i'm curious about that 
so the data is now alive this is a living image and i can update it in a second 
it's even fun to engage with them because it's visual 
and that is beautiful thank you 
i will show it to you 
the top note that you smelled at the very beginning the cut-grass green what we call in perfumery -- they’re weird terms -- and this would be called a green note because it smells of something green like cut grass 
this is cis-3-hexene-1-ol and i had to learn chemistry on the fly in the last three years a very expensive high school chemistry education 
now this is a totally insane idea 
and my definition of a theory is it’s not just something that you teach people it’s labor saving 
if it does you put the glass down you go to a different bar 
now i showed this to a physicist friend of mine who has a profound distaste for biology and he says that’s easy the things are a different color 
now fact b nothing in the world has that frequency except s-h 
and in an enormous 40-page paper in german he says at one point -- my wife is german and she translated it for me -- and at one point he says ganz widerlich geruch an absolutely repulsive smell which is good reminiscent of hydrogen sulfide 
and it’s fair to say that if you look up somebody’s nose you’re unlikely to see anything resembling this 
ok now if something absorbs the energy the electron can travel 
what’s nice about this idea if you have a philosophical bent of mind is that then it tells you that the nose the ear and the eye are all vibrational senses 
he says to me i bet you cannot make a coumarin 
now coumarin is a very common thing a material in fragrance which is derived from a bean that comes from south america 
and you’re completely wrong and i’m sure you’re completely wrong 
working with the harvard business school you'll see this example when you talk about minimum payment if you spent 62 dollars for a meal the longer you take to pay out that loan you see over a period of time using the minimum payment it's 99 dollars and 17 cents 
but it's going to work it's more effective than just computational aids 
received very favorably by business 
and there is some good news to report today 
there is no way we should do business with companies that have agreements with stealth provisions and that are unintelligible 
now we come down to it relatives grieving 
never retreat to the 'glorious past' keep to the track to the beaten track treat every day of your life as your last 
never acknowledge the ghost on the stair 
don't do it 
you bodies are wonderful as they are 
youth can never come again we have drunk the summer wine 
dearest do i love thee less 
do i shrink from thy caress 
lady lady do not weep -- what is gone is gone now sleep 
what of the titans of media 
and what of the constitution that bully of last resort 
at 30 my powers seemed mighty to me 
grown sick to our stomachs and sick of our lives 
um there are -- i've got far too much money and i have far too much fun in my businesses 
i was in a clinic i wasn't allowed to make telephone calls 
that was in october of 2000 
but sometimes i try to put myself in an evil man's position 
but sometimes i try to put myself in that position 
but it's interesting to me i love to write historical verse 
i love to think what they thought what it was like 
we're still doing it with all of the genius assembled in this room 
and you stay up for 12 
but always we scrabbled to lie with her first 
we are one species of about five and a half thousand mammalian species that exist on planet earth today 
you then hope that the earth moves in such a way as to bring the bones back up to the surface 
in fact if you go back in time it is the norm that there are multiple species of hominids or of human ancestors that coexist at any one time 
and i imagined him to be tall dark-skinned 
we began to find limb bones we found finger bones the bones of the pelvis vertebrae ribs the collar bones things that had never ever been seen before in homo erectus 
but also surprising finds recently announced from the island of flores in indonesia where a group of these human ancestors have been isolated and have become dwarfed and they're only about a meter in height 
and what is it that really makes us us 
i think it's our collective intelligence 
i had saved a few hundred photos of dodo skeletons into my creative projects folder -- it's a repository for my brain everything that i could possibly be interested in 
assuming it was roughly the size of my wife's hand i made some measurements of her thumb and i scaled them out to the size of the skull 
built out of words it is the engine that drives the plot of his book and also the movie in which another object is created a prop that has to represent the thing that hammett created out of words inspired by the kniphausen hawk and this represents the falcon in the movie 
and so now it was time to do some research 
what do they do how do you start something like that i really don't know 
and i'm following all the light kicks on this thing and making sure that as i'm holding the light in the same position i'm getting the same type of reflection on it -- that's the level of detail i'm going into this thing 
this thing was made of resin and it was too light 
that's half the weight of my dog huxley 
on the far left is a piece of crap -- a replica i bought on ebay 
so what do i do i figure i have two options 
one i can fire a freaking laser at it which i have already done to do a 3d scan -- there's a 3d scan of this falcon 
but really if we're all going to be honest with ourselves i have to admit that achieving the end of the exercise was never the point of the exercise to begin with was it 
it was actually developed for use by the offshore oil industry for diving on oil rigs down to a depth of 2000 feet 
if i go out in the open ocean environment virtually anywhere in the world and i drag a net from 3000 feet to the surface most of the animals -- in fact in many places 80 to 90 percent of the animals that i bring up in that net -- make light 
so you turn on the camera turn out the lights 
i knew my forward speed i knew the area and so i could figure out how many hundreds of sources there were per cubic meter 
so it uses its red bioluminescence like a sniper's scope to be able to sneak up on animals that are blind to red light and be able to see them without being seen 
and a lot of animals will use their bioluminescence as a lure 
so she's got a lure that she sticks out in front of this living mousetrap of needle-sharp teeth in order to attract in some unsuspecting prey 
so now we believe that the different shape of the lure is how the male recognizes the female in the anglerfish world because many of these males are what are known as dwarf males 
well this is a deep-sea version of women's lib 
she always knows where he is and she doesn't have to be monogamous because some of these females come up with multiple males attached 
and we were using a special trawling net that we were able to bring these animals up alive 
this is an unbelievable light show 
so i've wanted for a long time to figure out a different way to explore 
that's me on the left my graduate student at the time erika raymond and lee fry who was the engineer on the project 
we're at the edge of the brine pool there's a fish that's swimming towards the camera 
dna design nature art these are the three things that condition my world 
all the guys in the rugby team couldn't understand but anyway -- this is a meringue this is another sample i have 
it shows how you make one holistic form like the car industry and then you break up what you need 
it's like 21st-century henry moore when you see a henry moore still your hair stands up there's some amazing spiritual connect 
we need to be in that realm i want to do stuff like that 
this is two weeks ago in ccp in coventry who build parts for bentleys and so on 
this is what goes on in my studio everyday i walk -- i'm traveling i come back 
i said you get into biopolymers they looked straight through me 
i've had this image of a water droplet for 20 years sitting on a hot bed 
you see that thing you do 
i'm not putting charles eames' furniture in buildings anymore 
who cares 
this is called a plasnet 
these are my sculptures 
this is a room of sleep-deprived women 
and in the course of that i studied i met with medical doctors scientists and i'm here to tell you that the way to a more productive more inspired more joyful life is getting enough sleep 
and our guide was a local science teacher 
at the end of this day i could have filled a book just with stories about law from this one teacher 
we lack even a vocabulary to deal with this problem and that's because we have the wrong frame of reference 
the trial lawyers say well this legal fear makes doctors practice better medicine 
the fear has chilled professional interaction so thousands of tragic errors occur because doctors are afraid to speak up are you sure that's the right dosage 
it goes on we did a study of all the rules that affect one school in new york the board of ed had no idea 
i mean it's just absolutely a formula for failure 
and why not they don't trust the law why don't they trust the law 
well how do you fix it we could spend 10000 lifetimes trying to prune this legal jungle 
but law is different than other kinds of uncertainties because it carries with it the power of state 
if you make people self-conscious about their judgments studies show you will make them make worse judgments 
edison stated it best he said hell we ain't got no rules around here we're trying to accomplish something 
all these choices involve value judgments and social norms not objective facts 
you can't run a society by the lowest common denominator 
so what's needed is a basic shift in philosophy 
law is a human institution responsibility is a human institution 
if the judge doesn't have the authority to toss out unreasonable claims then all of us go through the day looking over our shoulders 
what the world needs now is to restore the authority to make common choices 
the second thing i want to do is introduce my co-author and dear friend and co-teacher 
we certainly can't trust the bankers and we certainly can't trust the brokers 
and even as we do our own work all too often we find ourselves having to choose between doing what we think is the right thing and doing the expected thing or the required thing or the profitable thing 
or if they do have our interests at heart we worry that they don't know us well enough to figure out what they need to do in order to allow us to secure those interests 
in addition we are struggling to find some way to create incentives for people in the financial services industry that will have them more interested in serving the long-term interests even of their own companies rather than securing short-term profits 
if there is a lesson to be learned from the financial collapse it is that 
a wise person knows when to bend the rules 
a wise person knows when to improvise 
and most important a wise person does this improvising and rule-bending in the service of the right aims 
he was supporting his wife and a child and the child was going to parochial school 
then he lost his job 
the judge on the case judge lois forer thought that this made no sense 
he did he served out his sentence 
for ms dewey this isn't why she became a teacher 
in the veterans' court -- this was the first of its kind in the united states 
why has the idea spread 
anyone would glom onto a criminal justice system that has this kind of a record 
so here's is a system-changer and it seems to be catching 
aristotle thought that practical wisdom was the key to happiness and he was right 
indeed we argue there is no substitute for wisdom 
first of all we started off the nuclear age in 1945 
we had a few nuclear weapons two of which we dropped on japan in hiroshima a few days later in nagasaki in august 1945 killing about 250000 people between those two 
so the goal was to evacuate the target cities 
we would move people out of the target cities into the countryside 
this disconnect was never actually resolved 
so what is a nuclear terror threat 
there are plans for how to create a terror farm where you could actually manufacture and develop all the components and assemble it 
since there is no real retribution possible that would make any difference since there are people willing to actually give up their lives in order to do a lot of damage to us it becomes apparent that the whole notion of this mutually assured destruction would not work 
you take it wherever you want to take it and you can detonate it 
you can't get an exact number for that kind of probability but what i'm trying to say is that we have all the elements of that happening 
i don't think we would see an all-out nuclear war any time soon although even that is not completely off the table 
there's still enough nuclear weapons in the arsenals of the superpowers to destroy the earth many many times over 
we're coming down and we bring that truck that you just saw somewhere in here in the financial district 
this is a 10-kiloton bomb slightly smaller than was used in hiroshima and i want to just conclude this by just giving you some information i think -- news you could use kind of concept here 
and if you're in this vicinity you've got to get away 
and if you're wearing clothing you've taken off your clothing you're going to get showered down some place and remove the radiation that would be -- the radioactive material that might be on you 
thank you 
no no i wasn't 14 years old 
i wasn't really a rocket scientist but i was working at the jet propulsion laboratory in sunny california where it's warm whereas now i'm in the mid-west and it's cold 
and he told me biosignatures we need to look for a biosignature 
and he said it's any measurable phenomenon that allows us to indicate the presence of life 
but immediately the system goes like what kind of dumb piece of code was this 
so you see waves of new types taking over the other types 
as long as i know that there's some sort of alphabet 
and obviously each of these letters comes off about roughly equally frequent 
and if i look at french texts it looks a little bit different or italian or german 
it doesn't matter whether it's a poem or whether it's a mathematical text 
the avidians being the denizens of this computer world where they are perfectly happy replicating and growing in complexity 
too hot too hot 
and i'm just showing this to you again because it's so nice 
one of them is if we are able to think about life in abstract terms -- and we're not talking about things like plants and we're not talking about amino acids and we're not talking about bacteria but we think in terms of processes -- then we could start to think about life not as something that is so special to earth but that in fact could exist anywhere 
but what really turns me on about technology is not just the ability to get more songs on mp3 players 
what i would like to see is idealism decoupled from all constraints 
political economic psychological whatever 
don't ask 
well i turned him down 
that's not a cause that's an emergency 
and what we're facing in africa is an unprecedented threat to human dignity and equality 
that's right 
we like to give and we give a lot 
you see africa makes a fool of our idea of justice 
africa is a continent in flames 
anyway i believe that that kind of thinking offends the intellectual rigor in this room 
there's an opportunity here and it's real 
our credibility 
i can't you can't as individuals but we can change the world 
but working together we can actually change the world 
ideas that you gestated in your youth 
well now actually because of you it is possible to change the physical world 
so why then are we not pumping our fists into the air 
but for the first time in history we have the technology we have the know-how we have the cash we have the life-saving drugs 
the clash wore big army boots not sandals 
but some of them they haven't 
not only in lives saved but in goodwill stability and security that we'll gain 
what i hope is that beyond individual merciful acts that you will tell the politicians to do right by africa by america and by the world 
give us that kind of dreaming that kind of doing 
the war against terror yes 
actually we're talking to abc today about the oscars 
we need to get the math we need to get the statistics out to the american people 
 one by one they step forward a nurse a teacher a homemaker and lives are saved 
we can make history 
we can start to make poverty history 
the idea that the internet which changed all of our lives can transform a country -- and a continent that has hardly made it to analog let alone digital -- blows my mind 
communication is very important for ethiopia -- will transform the country 
i am of course referring to none other than elvis presley 
and love is not love but being all shook up 
does that correspond 
metaphor creates a kind of conceptual synesthesia in which we understand one concept in the context of another 
one of the sentences was some jobs are jails 
and they had those expectations because agent metaphors imply the deliberate action of a living thing pursuing a goal 
but there is a better translation 
the latin word cogito is derived from the prefix co meaning together and the verb agitare meaning to shake 
and in that sense ballooning is a beautiful metaphor 
we want to go in a direction but the winds push us in another direction like in life 
and as long as we fight horizontally against life against the winds against what's happening to us life is a nightmare 
how do we go from the metaphor to something more practical that we can really use every day 
it's not true 
this is very practical 
this is why you need people with long-term vision 
but we were expected to have doubts we're expected to have fears 
it's to show you how much gas was left in the last bottles 
we landed with 40 kilos 
i had no idea how it was possible 
and when the capsule of my balloon was introduced officially in the air and space museum in washington together with the airplane of charles lindbergh with apollo 11 with the wright brothers' flyer with chuck yeager's 61 i had really a thought then 
it will be prohibited because we'll have to save our natural resources in a few decades from now 
which means that they have more proven the limits of renewable energies than the potential of it 
the goal is to take off end of this year for the first test but mainly next year spring or summer take off on our own power without additional help without being towed climb to 9000 meters altitude 
so you see that this airplane is more a symbol 
i don't think it will transport 200 people in the next years 
and 20 years later there were 200 people in every airplane crossing the atlantic 
and each time we have some ice in the future we have to know that life will be great and the success will be brilliant if we dare to overcome our fear of the ice to go through the obstacle to go through the problem in order to see what there is on the other side 
i wish i could show you my yemen 
it was very hard you know to impose my authority 
but a woman's got to do what a woman's got to do 
it's about proving who you are and what you can do 
but in assuming this responsibility and going about it as you have you have become a bridge between an older and traditional society and the one that you are now creating at the paper 
and this is true 
well the yemen times across 20 years has been through so much 
they think that if there's anything against them then we are being an opposition newspaper 
and very very difficult times 
and he ended up writing about a story that even surprised me -- hip hop -- that there are young yemeni men who express themselves through dancing and puchu puchu 
that thing  
i'm not so old 
actually that's a documentary that's available online the video's online 
and certainly you yourself and what you do have given us a view of the future that we will embrace and be grateful for 
on twitter also 
and it doesn't take much time to discover some really astonishing statistics with this issue 
it's the number one contaminant of groundwater drinking water rain water 
in some cases another species like the north american leopard frog showed that males exposed to atrazine grew eggs in their testes 
normally the testes should make testosterone the male hormone 
in fact this aromatase is so important in breast cancer that the latest treatment for breast cancer is a chemical called letrozole which blocks aromatase blocks estrogen so that if you developed a mutated cell it doesn't grow into a tumor 
pjc so speaking of estrogen one of the other compounds that tyrone talks about in the film is something called bisphenol a bpa which has been in the news recently 
so we're dosing our babies our newborns our infants with a synthetic estrogen 
so the pup you see on the bottom is affected by atrazine that its grandmother was exposed to 
and given the life of many of these chemicals generations years dozens of years that means that we right now are affecting the health of our grandchildren's grandchildren by things that we're putting into the environment today 
and this was something that was really brought home to me a year ago when i found out i was pregnant and the first scan revealed that my baby had a birth defect associated with exposure to estrogenic chemicals in the womb and the second scan revealed no heartbeat 
we know so much about global warming and climate change and yet we have no concept of what i've been calling internal environmentalism 
i'm not married but one year ago today i woke up from a month-long coma following a double lung transplant 
crazy i know insane 
but i was not limited when i sang and as air came up from my lungs through my vocal cords and passed my lips as sound it was the closest thing i had ever come to transcendence 
my father and my grandfather were always looking for the newest thing in alternative or traditional therapies for ph but after six months i couldn't walk up a small hill i couldn't climb a flight of stairs 
mine was 146 
doctors insert a catheter into your chest which is attached to a pump that weighs about four-and-a-half pounds 
literally hundreds of elevator rides were spent with me alone stuffing the pump into my spanx hoping the doors wouldn't open unexpectedly 
against my doctors' and family's wishes i needed to go back for the funeral 
i was dying and if i didn't mix that stuff up fast i would never leave that apartment alive 
i went back to the states anticipating i'd return to europe but the heart catheterization showed that i wasn't going anywhere further that a flight-for-life from johns hopkins hospital 
a happy patient is a healthy patient 
and it was right-heart failure 
it was a match 
because despite their problems i had spent my whole life training my lungs and i was not particularly enthusiastic about giving them up 
they left my chest open for two weeks 
an infection ravaged my skin 
if they stayed in there was no way i would ever sing again 
there were a dozen tubes coming in and out of my body 
i couldn't walk i couldn't talk i couldn't eat i couldn't move i certainly couldn't sing i couldn't even breathe but when i looked up and i saw my mother i couldn't help but smile 
whether by a mack truck or by heart failure or faulty lungs death happens 
but life isn't really just about avoiding death is it 
life magazine helped in this effort by announcing the introduction of throwaways that would liberate the housewife from the drudgery of doing dishes 
a teacher told me how to express the under-five-percent of plastics recovered in our waste stream 
in spite of deposit fees much of this trash leading out to the sea will be plastic beverage bottles 
isla san roque is an uninhabited bird rookery off baja's sparsely populated central coast 
notice that the bottles here have caps on them 
a four-month old laysan albatross chick died with this in its stomach 
that day i ended up spending nearly 60 
and this particular beach is kailua beach the beach where our president and his family vacationed before moving to washington 
we wanted to see if the most common fish in the deep ocean at the base of the food chain was ingesting these poison pills 
but no fishmonger on earth can sell you a certified organic wild-caught fish 
the range of the species goes up to as much as 380 feet tall 
i became very interested and i wrote about a couple 
his friend a guy named marwood harris was following behind 
but they made it to the top and what they found was not a redwood desert but a lost world -- a kind of three-dimensional labyrinth in the air filled with unknown life 
children are incredibly adept at climbing trees 
that's my son oliver 
if ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny then children are somewhat closer to our roots as primates in the arboreal forest 
you ascend 30 stories 
and there's also something that i want to show you 
the scientists are doing all kinds of experiments in these trees 
we're looking at the very top of gaya which is thought to be the oldest redwood 
what can the redwoods tell us about ourselves 
the flickering transitory quality of human time and the brevity of human life -- the necessity to love 
and i think that one of the happiest things is the sense that with my children i've been able to introduce them into the very small circle of humans who are lucky enough or possibly stupid enough to still climb trees 
but that's just a very small facet of a much greater problem of invasions of species worldwide all through the ecosystems and you know the earth itself -- ca partly caused by us inadvertently 
thank you 
we know because it says so inside the code 
and basit and amjad are first names pakistani first names 
so half a year ago i decided to go to pakistan myself 
and i knocked on the door 
you want to guess who opened the door 
so let me just run some viruses on my computer 
let me show you one which actually makes some sound 
we find guys like bjorn sundin originally from sweden and his partner in crime also listed on the interpol wanted pages mr shaileshkumar jain a us citizen 
now criminals who weren't capable of reaching us before can reach us 
but even more interestingly if we continue decrypting we'll find this mysterious string which says o600ko78rus 
it's not used for anything 
i got zero hits wasn't there 
so i spoke with the guys at the lab 
and on this blog he blogs about his life about his life in st petersburg -- he's in his early 20s -- about his cat about his girlfriend 
in fact this guy drives a mercedes-benz s600 v12 with a six-liter engine with more than 400 horsepower 
the vast majority of the online crime cases we don't even know which continent the attacks are coming from 
plc's these small boxes which have no display no keyboard which are programmed are put in place and they do their job 
you go to any factory any power plant any chemical plant any food processing plant you look around -- everything is being run by computers 
i'm worried that we are running into problems because of online crime 
i'm not engaged in predicting random number generators 
i don't have a clue 
mother theresa she was rational 
so we have to work out who influences problems 
there are lots of people shaping decisions and so if we want to predict correctly we have to pay attention to everybody who is trying to shape the outcome not just the people at the pinnacle of the decision-making pyramid 
so with just that little bit of input we can work out what the choices are that people have what the chances are that they're willing to take what they're after what they value what they want and what they believe about other people 
i remind you of that 90 percent accuracy rate 
what's its future 
over here you can see this is the distribution of power in favor of civilian nuclear energy today this is what that power block is predicted to be like by the late parts of 2010 early parts of 2011 
that power disappears completely nobody supports that by 2011 
here is mr ahmadinejad 
he is on the way down 
everything is not predictable the stock market is at least for me not predictable but most complicated negotiations are predictable 
and if you engineer what they do you can change the world you can get a better result 
so i've had an obsession basically for 30 years and that obsession has been what makes the difference in the quality of peoples lives 
whether it be your business your contribution to society money -- whatever it is for you -- your body your family 
but the other lesson of life that is rarely mastered is the art of fulfillment 
because science is easy right 
and everybody in this room -- you wouldn't be in this room if you bought that theory -- but the -- most of society thinks biography is destiny 
audience aye 
al gore supreme court  
if you don't have the money but you're creative and determined enough you find the way so this is the ultimate resource 
in this second consciously or unconsciously the minute you decide to focus on something you've got to give it a meaning and whatever that meaning is produces emotion 
honestly better or worse say aye 
how would their lives be different their impact 
audience aye 
let me tell you what they are first one certainty 
so that's why violence has always been around and will be around unless we have a consciousness change as a species 
i said focus on 'there's food' -- what a concept you know 
second -- but this is what changed my life this is what shaped me as a human being -- somebody's gift 
10 seconds that's all i want to be respectful 10 seconds 
if you saw these women on the street in their faded clothes you might dismiss them as poor and simple 
we will not be there 
mau is a palu a navigator priest 
their tradition is so extraordinary that these mariners sailed three million square miles across the pacific without the use of instruments 
the palu also had an uncanny ability to forecast weather conditions days in advance 
their achievements intellectually and scientifically are extraordinary and they are so relevant for these times that we are in when we are riding out storms 
we cannot afford to lose it 
the link between the past and the future is fragile 
i am haunted by the fact that i no longer remember the names of the winds and the rains 
and i am reminded that throughout the world there are cultures with vast sums of knowledge in them as potent as the micronesian navigators that are going dismissed that this is a testament to brilliant brilliant technology and science and wisdom that is vanishing rapidly 
youtube cares deeply about the rights of content owners but in order to give them choices about what they can do with copies mashups and more we need to first identify when copyrighted material is uploaded to our site 
because sony music had registered chris brown's video in our content id system within seconds of attempting to upload the video the copy was detected giving sony the choice of what to do next 
the video's inspired over 26000 dollars in donations to end domestic violence 
so why has no one ever solved this problem before 
but it's not just about dollars and impressions 
♫ billie crept softly ♫ ♫ into my waking arms ♫ ♫ warm like a sip of sour mash ♫ ♫ strange fruit for ♫ ♫ a sweet hunk of trash ♫ ♫ panic at the stage door ♫ ♫ of carnegie hall ♫ ♫ famous jazz singer gone awol ♫ ♫ must have left the building ♫ ♫ body and soul ♫ ♫ on a creaky ♫ ♫ piano stool tonight ♫ ♫ as the moon is my ♫ ♫ only witness ♫ ♫ she was breathing ♫ ♫ in my ear ♫ ♫ this time it's love ♫ ♫ but love is a loaded pistol ♫ ♫ by daybreak she's gone ♫ ♫ over the frozen river home ♫ ♫ me and johnny walker ♫ ♫ see in the new age ♫ ♫ alone ♫ ♫ stay with me ♫ ♫ again tonight ♫ ♫ billie time ♫ ♫ time is a wily trickster ♫ ♫ still an echo ♫ ♫ in my heart says ♫ ♫ this time it's love ♫  so i really consider myself a storyteller 
since the dawn of human history we've tried to rectify this imbalance by making art writing poems singing songs scripting editorials and sending them in to a newspaper gossiping with friends this is nothing new 
it's been running for about a year and a half 
and i'll show you a glimpse of how this information is then visualized so this is we feel fine 
the dots exhibit human qualities they kind of have their own physics and they swarm wildly around kind of exploring the world of life 
and then they also exhibit curiosity 
there's also murmurs montage mobs metrics and mounds 
and then one by one in reverse chronological order they excuse themselves entering the scrolling list of feelings 
i feel invisible to you 
i feel in love with carolyn i feel so naughty 
this is in response to what's beautiful miss world 
and it caused me to wonder about our world today 
and those are the questions that inspired my new project which is debuting here today at ted 
it's called universe revealing our modern mythology 
this is the universe of 2007 the last two months 
but we can actually be more specific in defining our universe 
so we see obama and the clintons meet in alabama 
you can see that this is an important story there are a lot of things in its orbit if we open this up we get different perspectives on this story 
and you'll all be able to use it and kind of explore what your own personal mythology might be 
as you search for the things that are important to you in your world and then see what the constellations of those might look like 
we're facing this problem 
there is the problem 
and you know going back maybe 10 years in time when i got the funding to buy my first graphics computer -- it was a huge machine 
it was cabinets of processors and storage and everything 
this is a data set that was captured using a ct scanner 
and of course all the data is inside so i can start rotating i can look at it from different angles and i can see that this woman had a problem 
and one of the applications that we've been working on -- and this has gotten a little bit of traction worldwide -- is the application of virtual autopsies 
so this is from a virtual autopsy 
the person was killed by stabs in the heart but they just deposited the knife by putting it through one of the eyeballs 
here's another case that i think is interesting 
during a physical autopsy if you actually have to dig through the body to find these fragments that's actually quite hard to do 
so if you have the opportunity please try it out 
it's really a hands-on experience 
and this is a bit of science fiction now so we're moving into really the future 
and he's also hearing our instructions when we tell him to do things 
and in just a second here you will see -- okay here motts now move your left foot 
i can look inside of it 
and here it is here is the nose of the bear 
well 80 percent of the men in lesotho worked in the mines over the border in brutal conditions 
he was the son of one of the poorest families in the village 
perhaps the universe existed before the bang and the bang was just a violent event in a pre-existing universe 
i won't go into the details of why we think the universe is like this but it comes out of the math and trying to explain the physics that we know 
and there've been bangs in the past and there will be bangs in the future 
what about africa 
it's still going on 
what about africa's capacity to do something about these problems 
well here's the number of physicians in africa 
and while i was busy working -- i was working on these colliding worlds in the day 
and we got lots of applicants 
you have to rethink what is the university for 
no droning on at the chalkboard 
everyone lives together in this hotel -- lecturers and students -- and it's not surprising at all to find an impromptu tutorial at 1 am 
we especially emphasize areas of great relevance to africa's development because in those areas scientists working in africa will have a competitive advantage 
they'll publish be invited to conferences 
and aims has done extremely well 
five students can be educated at aims for the cost of educating one in the us or europe 
she communicates well with the immunologists at the hospital 
here are the current students at aims there are 53 of them from 20 different countries including 20 women 
so now i'm going to get to my ted business 
i want to point out a few other exceptional people in this picture 
and she's now at aims  
and our wish has two parts one is a dream and the other's a plan ok 
our ted dream is that the next einstein will be african  
we want to add entrepreneurship and policy skills 
over the last year we've been visiting sites in africa looking at potential sites for new aims centers 
so we have political support right across the continent 
but nobody was really worried about this 
this is a quote actually from alan turing in 30 years it will be as easy to ask a computer a question as to ask a person 
this was in 1946 and now in 2007 it's still not true 
that's how much power this computer uses 
rory is a graduate student at stanford 
i estimate 10 to the 16 bits per second which is actually about very similar to what blue gene does 
and let me just summarize so the bottom line the brain processes information using 100000 times less energy than we do right now with this computer technology that we have 
so this clip is from the pbs series the secret life of the brain 
and that's basically what's going on in your brain right now as you're watching this 
the devices that computers use are what's called a transistor 
your computer uses this presence of current to represent a one and the absence of current to represent a zero 
but when it's open because these ions have to line up and flow through one at a time you get a kind of sporadic not steady -- it's a sporadic flow of current 
in fact there's about 12 electrons can all be flowing this way 
what you see here is that there's these redundant connections 
this is kareem's dark eyes and that's the white background that you see here 
so we are really duplicating the kind of signals that you have on the optic nerve 
let me just end by saying that this is what happens when you put africa in a piano ok 
and i had this gut reaction that this was the wrong way to do it 
i'm interested in finding whether or not there is a really massive what we like to call supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy 
but today the way i want you to understand a black hole for the proof of a black hole is to think of it as an object whose mass is confined to zero volume 
so why is it so important 
now the key here is to figure out what that schwarzschild radius is 
it depends only on the mass of the object 
there are big ones there are little ones 
and there are a hundred billion stars in that galaxy just to give you a sense of scale 
so at the center there that's actually where most of the starlight comes out from 
so you can't see the black hole itself but you can convert the gravitational energy of the black hole into the light we see 
and if there is a supermassive black hole what we need to assume is that it's a black hole on a diet 
and we live in the middle of it so when we look towards the center we see this plane which defines the plane of the galaxy or line that defines the plane of the galaxy 
it's the gravitational pull that makes these things orbit 
so this is great because remember my job is to show there is a lot of mass inside a small volume 
so i want to see the stars that are as close to the center of the galaxy as possible 
because i want to show there is a mass inside as small a region as possible 
and that buys us about a factor of 20 
so without this technology you can't see the stars 
and this one this one goes around in a human lifetime 
and the truth is i'm not quite there 
but we actually have no alternative today to explaining this concentration of mass 
likewise for the young stars or in contrast the young stars they just should not be there 
using observations that are not the ones i've shown you today we can actually figure out which ones are old and which ones are young 
the old ones are red 
he didn't read a note and he was profoundly hearing impaired 
and the thing about classical music that what and how it's inexhaustible 
and a tough slouchy kid got up to bat and he took a swing and really connected 
brah dada dadadadah 
and whether we call them 440 per second a or 3729 b flat -- trust me that's right -- they're just phenomena 
and in the 17th century it was more like this 
and there began to be a real difference at this point between the art of improvisation and the art of composition 
so in the first eight centuries or so of this tradition the big 'what' was to praise god 
the 'how' was a style called polyphony music of many independently moving voices that suggested the way the planets seemed to move in ptolemy's geocentric universe 
ah avaricious heaven 
and the chords it turned out were capable of representing incredible varieties of emotions 
it's just these two notes in the middle 
and it turned out the symphony could be used for more complex issues like gripping ones of culture such as nationalism or quest for freedom or the frontiers of sensuality 
what happens when the music stops 
where does it go what's left 
it's the passing on part it's the 'why' part of it 
at the same time technology by taking over the role that notation had always played shifted the balance within music between instinct and intelligence way over to the instinctive side 
what's the long-term effect of this on us or on music 
nobody knows 
there's just a role here for so many people -- teachers parents performers -- to be explorers together 
you can start anywhere ramble a bit 
then these two fellows came along and they were flying kites to develop the control systems that would ultimately enable powered human flight 
but unfortunately it relegated kites once again to be considered children's toys 
and it doesn't hurt to do it in a location like this either 
if you'd loan me your gulfstream i'll rip its wings off and generate you a megawatt 
the story starts with just a single person a child behaving a little strangely 
they're creating the ecosystem from which innovation emerges 
it's based on hundreds of hours of research of practice 
now here's an example -- pre-internet -- of this machine in action 
i mean you might just be a kid with a webcam but if you can do something that goes viral you get to be seen by the equivalent of sports stadiums crammed with people 
and even if it's not that eloquent -- and it's not -- it can still really make your day 
in fact my colleague june cohen has taken to calling it radical openness because it works for us each time 
by giving away our tedx brand we suddenly have a thousand-plus live experiments in the art of spreading ideas 
we're a social species 
and that's why what i'm excited about and what i think is under-reported is the significance of the rise of online video 
he's a unicyclist 
jove is a website that was founded to encourage scientists to publish their peer-reviewed research on video 
why do people like watching tedtalks 
500 years ago it ran into a competitor with a lethal advantage 
i mean today one person speaking can be seen by millions shedding bright light on potent ideas creating intense desire for learning and to respond -- and in his case intense desire to laugh 
thousands of people are figuring out new ways to learn and crucially to respond completing the cycle 
and so as we've thought about this you know it's become clear to us what the next stage of ted's evolution has to be 
they used the same trash to form green manure 
thank you 
the name abegg -- abegg is actually a-b-e-g-g and that's the main theme in the melody 
what i do first is i make a lot of little musical ideas -- you can just improvise here at the piano -- and i choose one of those to become my main theme my main melody like the abegg that you just heard 
so for inspiration i listened to liszt and tchaikovsky and all the great romantic composers 
and once i realized it there's a parallel between creating music and creating art because for your motive or your little initial idea for your drawing it's your character -- you want to decide who do you want to draw or if you want to draw an original character 
like am i going to use one page 
am i going to use a two-page spread like a comic book for more grandiose effect i guess 
instead i'd like to try something called improvisation 
and that's a huge amount of data 
and the more technical topics such as architecture materials and strangely enough men those are not good topics to talk about 
ingenious tedtalks much more this green color etc et 
now since this is tedactive and i learned from my analysis that i should actually give you something i will not impose the ultimate or worst tedtalk on you but rather give you a tool to create your own 
and i call this tool the tedpad 
thank you very much 
now if you combine this very simple very conservative thought -- go with the grain of human nature -- with all the advances in behavioral economics some of which we were just hearing about again i think we can achieve a real increase in well-being in happiness in a stronger society without necessarily having to spend a whole lot more money 
well i can't in the time i've got give huge numbers of examples but let me just give a few of the ways that life can change 
and this is so obvious in a way because you think about how all of you have changed the way we shop the way we travel the way that business is done 
we want to get people to be more energy efficient 
obviously here we have jfk with that incredibly simple and powerful formulation ask not what your country can do for you ask what you can do for your country an incredibly noble sentiment 
but when he made that speech what could you do to build the stronger better society 
and i think an even more wonderful speech which i'm going to read a big chunk of which sums up what i said at the beginning about believing there is more to life than money and more that we should try and measure than money 
some say up to five tons 
they're fantastic creatures 
so they were incredibly important animals 
the importance of basking sharks to the coast communities is recognized through the language 
and most of what we do know is based on their habit of coming to the surface 
and we try to guess what they're doing from their behavior on the surface 
and we tagged them very simply not very hi-tech with a big long pole 
and of course sharks fish are underwater most of the time 
and here's a couple of maps that we've done 
that one you can see that we tagged both off kerry 
so he did another study using microsatellites which are much more expensive much more time consuming and to his surprise came up with almost identical results 
and it's thought maybe it was a bottleneck a genetic bottleneck thought to be 12000 years ago and this has caused a very low diversity 
but the average of all these studies came out -- the mean is about 5000 which i personally don't believe but then i am a skeptic 
in fact of those 20000 8000 were thought to be females 
they didn't get enough samples to really explore the genetics in enough detail 
and some are caught in nets in trawls 
and in about half an hour we got five samples five individual sharks were sampled using simon's shark slime sampling system 
and i was thinking of humpback whales breaching and dolphins 
and what you're trying to look at is the males have claspers which kind of dangle out behind the back of the shark 
and you just want to learn as much as you can as soon as you can 
philosophers dramatists theologians have grappled with this question for centuries what makes people go wrong 
so when i read robert louis stevenson that wasn't fiction 
and apparently he disobeyed god and that's the ultimate disobedience to authority 
i became an expert witness for one of the guards sergeant chip frederick and in that position i had access to the dozen investigative reports 
i had access to him i could study him have him come to my home get to know him do psychological analysis to see was he a good apple or bad apple 
why tier 1-a was the center for military intelligence 
that's one of the visual illustrations of evil 
who are the bad apples well that's a bad question 
and so we're interested in what are the external factors around the individual -- the bad barrel 
and social scientists stop there and they miss the big point that i discovered when i became an expert witness for abu ghraib 
this is stanley milgram little jewish kid from the bronx and he asked the question could the holocaust happen here now 
he gets tied up to the shock apparatus in another room 
and so he's the modern lucifer effect a man of god who becomes the angel of death 
it was a real cop car it was a real policeman and there were real neighbors in the street who didn't know that this was an experiment 
do they kill torture mutilate 13 
if you give people power without oversight it's a prescription for abuse they knew that and let that happen 
the answer is nobody and i think nobody on purpose 
banality of heroism is it's ordinary people who do heroic deeds 
he was a low-level private and that stopped it was he a hero no 
she came down saw that madhouse and said you know what it's terrible what you're doing to those boys 
so the psychology of heroism is -- we're going to end in a moment -- how do we encourage children in new hero courses that i'm working with matt langdon -- he has a hero workshop -- to develop this heroic imagination this self-labeling i am a hero in waiting and teach them skills 
wesley and the guy -- 20 and a half inches height 
a half an inch would have taken his head off 
take path one you're going to be a perpetrator of evil 
path two you become guilty of the evil of passive inaction 
we should in fact because without having this possibility of conscious minds we would have no knowledge whatsoever about our humanity we would have no knowledge whatsoever about the world 
so much for the wonder now for the mystery 
and in that image there you see a variety of islands of what i call image-making regions in the brain 
you have the green for example that corresponds to tactile information or the blue that corresponds to auditory information 
but what about the self 
and for a long time people did not even want to touch it because they'd say how can you have this reference point this stability that is required to maintain the continuity of selves day after day 
i like to call it an almost infinite sameness from day to day 
there is the brain stem in between the cerebral cortex and the spinal cord 
it developed in collectives of human beings 
why care if it is the brain stem or the cerebral cortex and how this is made 
and if we are interested for example in the fact that anti-gravity is pulling galaxies away from the earth why should we not be interested in what is going on inside of human beings 
when i was just a little girl my mom started what is now the longest-running women's film festival in the world 
fishnet stockings 
i thought they were really hot 
there are lots of very modern political movements that have caught fire in no small part because of cultural hipness 
and one of our biggest successes is we get mail from teenage girls in the middle of iowa who say i googled jessica simpson and stumbled on your site 
we don't want one face 
thank you 
it's enough to make you feel very overwhelmed 
which brings me to my third paradox 
you may have guessed by now i did not light myself on fire 
cornel west says of course it's a failure 
she was talking about board meetings she was founding peace organizations she was coordinating carpools she was consoling friends -- all these daily acts of care and creativity 
and surely at three and four years old i was listening to the soothing sound of her voice but i think i was also getting my first lesson in activist work 
know thyself 
and we feel like we have to get far far away to a secluded retreat leaving it all behind 
this is the term that armies use when they've lost a battle 
you may or may not have noticed that i'm wearing a tiny electrode on my forehead 
let me show you what it looks like 
or what if i can take that information and put it into an organic shape up on the screen 
i may also be interested in knowing how focused i am so i can put my level of attention into the circuit board on the other side 
and that was responsiveness 
we then realized that if technology could know something about you and use it to help you there's an even more valuable application than that 
in the original zen bound game you play it by scrolling your fingers over the pad 
you have graphs and charts that tell you how your brain was doing -- not just how much rope you used or what your high score is but what was going on inside of your mind 
the way these children will be able to use their new awareness to improve themselves will upend many of the damaging and widespread social stigmas that people who are diagnosed as different are challenged with 
thank you 
so i used to get my eyes tested just for fun 
so let me just tell you the great part of all of this 
and so when i heard that eye specialist tell me all the things a big fat no everybody imagines i was devastated 
the first thing i thought about was my mom who was crying over beside me 
and that wind in my face made me believe that he was mad and i would drive 
oh for the love of god 
i just was so -- how do i tell him 
and then he said to me what did you want to be when you were little 
i know this run so well by the back of my hand 
i count the steps and the lampposts and all those things that visually impaired people have a tendency to have a lot of meetings with 
and you know the extraordinary part of it is i just simply had no answers 
and nobody can tell me no 
yes you can say i can't be an archeologist 
i'm going to go across india on the back of an elephant 
and i never thought about noes anymore or not seeing or any of that kind of nothing 
and consequently we can see the result all around us 
i hope it's not the curb cut between the chuck e cheese and the target store because that's not good enough for americans to be spilling their blood for  
this is the other side of the building 
and what is the message that is coming what are the vocabularies and grammars that are coming from this building and how is it informing us about who we are 
you know this is a building designed like a dvd player  
anyway this is how you compose and assemble a downtown business building and this is what happened when in glens falls new york when we tried to do it again where it was missing right 
and that starts to be delivered in the form of the railroad suburb the country villa along the railroad line which allows people to enjoy the amenity of the city but to return to the countryside every night 
and that's the great non-articulated agony of suburbia and one of the reasons that it lends itself to ridicule 
i don't have any eyes on the side of my head i can't see 
so they take the first one that comes along often 
we're going to have to do something else instead 
so that you know the residences make sense deployed in relation to the places of business of culture and of governance 
the dead malls what are we going to do with them 
no amount or combination of alternative fuels is going to allow us to continue running what we're running the way we're running it 
we're going to have to do everything very differently 
and america's not prepared 
and within that context we can offer the kids time -- something that seems in short supply in their over-scheduled lives 
all materials are available for use 
it's a great honor today to share with you the digital universe which was created for humanity to really see where we are in the universe 
nasa supported this work 12 years ago as part of the rebuilding of the hayden planetarium so that we would share this with the world 
i captured this live from my laptop in a cafe called earth matters on the lower east side of manhattan where i live and it was done as a collaborative project with the rubin museum of himalayan art for an exhibit on comparative cosmology 
but this our containment of the visible universe 
this map can be updated and we can add in new data 
we have a growing user base of this and we network domes 
so you're seeing the edge of the earth 
this is nepal and tibet 
thank you 
so he figures out a way to download himself into his environment actually into a series of books 
i think that this is the future of interface it's the future of music the future of instruments 
and i'll let adam tell you so adam is a phd student at mit an expert in music technology and medicine and adam and dan have become close collaborators 
adam boulanger yes so tod and i entered into a discussion following the tewksbury work and it was really about how dan is an expressive person and he's an intelligent and creative person and it's in his face it's in his breathing it's in his eyes how come he can't perform one of his pieces of music that's our responsibility and it doesn't make sense 
but what about expression what about that moment when an artist delivers that piece of work you know do our technologies allow us to express 
so let's do it so dan do you want to tell everyone about what you're going to play now 
so he can go in hyperscore you start out by making melodies and rhythms 
he can place those exactly where he wants 
but instead of making it very literal showing you exactly the camera tracing we turned it into a graphic that shows you the basic movement and shows the way it's being analyzed 
yeah 
and these women sing an enchanting song a song so alluring that all sailors who hear it crash into the rocks and die 
i want to hear that song untie me 
there is first the present self 
well resisting temptation is hard as the 19th century english economist nassau william senior said to abstain from the enjoyment which is in our power or to seek distant rather than immediate results are among the most painful exertions of the human will 
so the first is when you've got one of these devices going such as this contract to write everyday or pay it's just a constant reminder that you have no self-control 
the other problem with commitment devices is that you can always weasel your way out of them 
and this is a timely issue 
and we're at a situation now where for every three baby boomers the mckinsey global institute predicts that two will not be able to meet their pre-retirement needs while they're in retirement 
he said that we might neglect our future selves because of some failure of belief or imagination 
when you make an investment what you're really saying is i accept that any one of these 100 things could happen to me and determine my wealth 
once you find an investment that you're happy with what people do is they click done and the markers begin to disappear slowly one by one 
if you save very little the future self is unhappy living on 44 percent of the income 
and what's nice about it is it's not something that biasing people actually because as one face smiles the other face frowns 
there are programs you can get to see how people might look if they smoke if they get too much exposure to the sun if they gain weight and so on 
hal is here so i think we owe it to him as well as yourself to disabuse you of that last image 
i began my life as a markets professional and continued to take an interest but most of my recent effort has been looking at the value of what comes to human beings from nature and which doesn't get priced by the markets 
and the answer is yeah it can 
biodiversity the living fabric of this planet is not a gas 
and if you look at the species level you saw about fish 
and at this rate at which we are losing fish it is a human problem of enormous dimensions a health problem of a kind we haven't seen before 
the green represents the percentage 
the reason this is happening boils down in my mind to one basic problem which is our inability to perceive the difference between public benefits and private profits 
we tend to constantly ignore public wealth simply because it is in the common wealth it's common goods 
it causes pollutants being issued which have an economic cost health cost and so on 
when we measure gdp as a measure of economic performance at the national level we don't include our biggest asset at the country level 
when we measure corporate performances we don't include our impacts on nature and what our business costs society 
that has to stop 
so clearly there was a problem with deforestation 
and i couldn't answer because neither of these companies good though they are and professional though they are do not calculate or disclose their externalities 
that's an example i think for us to look at and for us to draw comfort from 
if more companies did this and if more sectors engaged this as sectors you could have analysts business analysts and you could have people like us and consumers and ngos actually look and compare the social performance of companies 
has already set up a coalition to do this an international coalition 
a bit like inflation you over-issue currency you get what you see declining prices 
so in selecting targets of 450 parts per million and selecting two degrees at the climate negotiations what we have done is we've made an ethical choice 
i decided when i was asked to do this that what i really wanted to talk about was my friend richard feynman 
richard feynman was a very complex man 
he was a man of many many parts 
it may still exist i don't know 
but it was really brutal 
but the amazing thing was -- feynman had to leave a little early 
sometimes i would win mostly he would win but we both enjoyed them 
and he said leonardo were you closer to your mother or to you father when you were a kid 
being dick he of course wanted to check this 
there went that theory down the trashcan of history 
but let me tell you a little bit about feynman the physicist 
he would try to visualize it guided by a small number of simple principles 
it was so simple in fact that i suspect a really smart high school student who didn't even have calculus could understand what he wrote down 
you simply take the proton and you hit it really sharply with an electron 
so i think i'll just finish up by saying i actually don't think feynman would have liked this event 
thank you 
when this trailer showed up at my shop in berkeley i'd actually never stepped foot in an airstream trailer or any other trailer 
i decided i had to do some research and really figure out what had gone wrong somewhere along the history of airstream 
there's no such things as two walls and a ceiling coming together where you can change materials and shapes 
that's the trailer pretty much finished 
i thought finally oh yeah great big company i'm gonna work with somebody with money for tooling and molding 
welcome to five dangerous things you should let your children do 
we put warnings on coffee cups to tell us that the contents may be hot 
so where does this trend stop 
and yeah they're going to cut themselves 
so practicing throwing things has been shown to stimulate the frontal and parietal lobes which have to do with visual acuity 3d understanding and structural problem solving so it gives a sense -- it helps develop their visualization skills and their predictive ability 
number four -- deconstruct appliances 
and it's fun for the whole family 
narrator we are all aware of the risk of cancer but there's another disease that's destined to affect even more of us arthritis 
this is the field of biologic replacements where we replace worn-out parts with new natural ones 
and it works not just for my wife but certainly for other patients 
and so that's not going to be a solution that's going to get us global with biologic tissue 
how are we going to revolutionize artificial joint replacement 
the space age began 50 years ago in october and that’s exactly what sputnik looked like 
they would bring them back and mount them 
so that’s for fun 
you can see how portable and handy it was to have your own guttenberg in 1455 
in 1455 nobody could read 
but why is this so interesting here’s the quick story 
that is why the printing press succeeded and that is why martin luther nailed his 90 theses to the door because he was complaining that the catholic church had gone amok in printing out indulgences and selling them in every town and village and city in all of western europe 
instead of showing an object from the stage i’m going to do something special for the first time 
we are going to show actually what the library looks like ok 
and all throughout the library are different objects different spaces 
and yet looking at them you would see a machine and a molecule 
and what does a lump of coal have to do with the internet 
what that means is a 200-megabyte file looks like this ladies and gentlemen ok 
the ego is not supposed to be involved in graphic design 
so then i can add some color in with the background and add a bit more color in with the words themselves and this way working with the art director i'm able to bring it to just the right point that it's puzzling for the audience -- they can figure out that there's something they have to read -- but it's not impossible for them to read 
so i'm currently working on a book which plays with both senses of the word as i explore some of my own ideas and inquiries in a visual display of rather peacock-like grandeur 
i've been sending out valentines on a fairly large scale since 2005 
there's a longer story to this but i did get them all done in time and they were extremely well received 
i got an almost 100 percent response rate 
i had this idea that i wanted people to receive a kind of mysterious love letter like a found fragment in their mailbox 
and i specifically wrote four pages that don't connect 
i'm certain i can see you blushing 
so i solicited friends to send me their used christmas cards and i made 500 of these 
what does it say 
so that's why i do what i do and why i spend so much time and effort on it and why i work in the commercial public sphere as opposed to the isolated private sphere of fine art because i want as many people as possible to see my work notice it be drawn into it and be able to take something from it 
and i actually really feel that it's worthwhile to spend my valuable and limited time on this earth in this way 
and i thank you for allowing me to show it to you 
the main characteristics of such a system is that there's one sole contact point to the ground 
he's now keeping a constant distance to thomas 
and of course who wouldn't like to take a ride on one of these 
and i say what is the light bulb good for 
even when you're standing in front of a megaphone it's pretty much every direction 
i got this waterfall i recorded in my back yard 
you have to be kind of smart and though i did not graduate from college doesn't mean i'm stupid because you cannot be stupid and do very much in the world today 
we're just starting to really discover the laws of nature and science and physics 
i have been really lucky with this technology all of a sudden as it is ready the world is ready to accept it 
this unit that i played goes from about 200 hertz to above the range of hearing 
it's actually emitting ultrasound -- low-level ultrasound -- that's about 100000 vibrations per second 
and the sound that you're hearing unlike a regular speaker on which all the sound is made on the face is made out in front of it in the air 
or you can whisper in the ear of a supposed terrorist some biblical verse 
we put it on a turret with a camera so that when they shoot at you you're over there and it's there 
i took it back to the pentagon after it got declassified when the patent issued and told the people back there about it and they laughed and then i took them back a demo and they bought 
so i've been really lucky as an inventor 
i've got a coke can opening that's right in your head that's really cool 
appreciate it very much 
i thought i would talk a little bit about how nature makes materials 
i've been fascinated by how nature makes materials and there's a lot of sequence to how they do such an exquisite job 
so that's the vision that i've been thinking about 
there's diatoms made out of sio2 and they're magnetotactic bacteria that make small single-domain magnets used for navigation 
and i was really fortunate to have president obama visit my lab this year on his visit to mit and i really wanted to give him a periodic table 
what if he says 'oh i already have one' or 'i've already memorized it'  
now if you take all billion viruses and you can put them in one drop of liquid you can force them to interact with anything you want on the periodic table 
so basically viruses can't replicate themselves they need a host 
and so through a process of selection evolution we went from being able to have a virus that made a crummy battery to a virus that made a good battery to a virus that made a record-breaking high-powered battery that's all made at room temperature basically at the bench top 
you can make lots of amplifications to it 
when you shine light on them you can see them bubbling 
in this case you're seeing oxygen bubbles come out 
the last example are solar cells 
and what we've found is through genetic engineering we can actually increase the efficiencies of these solar cells to record numbers for these types of dye-sensitized systems 
i'll hear things like an extra room in the house the basement the coffee shop the library 
and then you'll hear things like the train a plane a car -- so the commute 
why is that happening 
you don't have a workday anymore you have work moments 
it's like the front door of the office is like a cuisinart and you walk in and your day is shredded to bits because you have 15 minutes here and 30 minutes there and then something else happens and you're pulled off your work and you've got to do something else then you have 20 minutes then it's lunch 
i sat at my desk i used my expensive computer 
you might have a quick idea but to be in deep thought about a problem and really consider a problem carefully you need long stretches of uninterrupted time 
now there are different kinds of distractions but there aren't the really bad kinds of distractions that i'll talk about in just a minute 
so sleep is about sleep phases or stages -- some people call them different things 
if you're interrupted and woken up you have to start again 
i don't think anyone would say yes 
they'll also say -- sometimes they'll also say well if i can't see the person how do i know they're working 
which is ridiculous of course but that's one of the excuses that managers give 
no one cared about letting people take a smoke break for 15 minutes 10 years ago so why does everyone care about someone going to facebook here and there or twitter here and there or youtube here and there 
those are the real problems in the modern office today 
that's kind of bad 
and meetings are just toxic terrible poisonous things during the day at work 
what if they're doing important work 
if there are 10 people in the meeting it's a 10-hour meeting it's not a one-hour meeting 
it's 10 hours of productivity taken from the rest of the organization to have this one one-hour meeting which probably should have been handled by two or three people talking for a few minutes 
these things don't exist outside of the office 
i have about three minutes so that'll fit perfectly 
i don't know if people still do that 
so just the afternoon one thursday 
this is when people actually get stuff done is when no one's bothering them when no one's interrupting them 
all these discussions and decisions you thought you had to make at this one time at 9 am on monday just forget about them and things will be just fine 
and i specialize in human behavioral research and applying what we learn to think about the future in different ways and to design for that future 
and it'll take about another two years to connect the next billion after that 
so this is interesting to us because the conscious and subconscious decision process implies that the stuff that you do take with you and end up using has some kind of spiritual emotional or functional value 
but if you ask people what the three most important things that they carry are -- across cultures and across gender and across contexts -- most people will say keys money and if they own one a mobile phone 
and a mobile phone it turns out is a great recovery tool 
but -- and it's a pretty big but -- we forget 
i think quite a nice feature 
and these things don't stay in the center of gravity but over time they gravitate there 
but the difference between this and that is there's no central authority trying to control this 
and ok if you break one of these things here you return it to the carrier 
they'll probably give you three new ones right 
it challenges the norms 
this is how it's shifting 
i'm just the messenger 
and companies like navigenics and dna direct and 23andme that are giving you your genetic profiles are giving some people a sense of gosh well what can i do about it 
and so my request is please let's make technologies that make people more human and not less 
i made a lot of mistakes and dumb decisions of course 
so let's say for instance that you're on your way to your best friend's wedding and you're trying to get to the airport and you're stuck in terrible traffic and you finally arrive at your gate and you've missed your flight 
we wish we'd taken better advantage of the education that we did have 
odds are you're not going to care in five years 
it feels terrible regret feels awful 
and the thought was make it go away 
we just want it to vanish 
make it go away make it go away 
in point of fact no insurance covers acts of idiocy 
and the problem is that there are certain things that happen in life that we desperately want to change and we cannot 
but first i want to say that the intensity and persistence with which we experience these emotional components of regret is obviously going to vary depending on the specific thing that we're feeling regretful about 
the fda estimates that of all the americans who have tattoos 17 percent of us regret getting them 
now in my case this really wasn't a problem because it's actually very easy to laugh at yourself when you're 29 years old and you want your mommy because you don't like your new tattoo 
all right 
and what i loved about this image of the compass was that i felt like it encapsulated both of these ideas in one simple image 
even in wealthy countries it is common now to see inequality growing 
in the united states since 2001 we've had five years of economic growth five years of productivity growth in the workplace but median wages are stagnant and the percentage of working families dropping below the poverty line is up by four percent 
it is also unstable 
because primarily of the power of the internet people of modest means can band together and amass vast sums of money that can change the world for some public good if they all agree 
you saw one reference to that in what we were able to do with aids drugs 
when i got out of office and was asked to work first in the caribbean to try to help deal with the aids crisis generic drugs were available for about 500 dollars a person a year 
we need a movie on those six categories 
and all of you need to have it embedded in your brains and to organize yourselves around it 
you think about whatever your life has been however many obstacles you have faced in your life at critical junctures you always knew there was a predictable connection between the effort you exerted and the result you achieved 
as poor as haiti is in the area where farmer's clinic is active -- and they serve a catchment area far greater than the medical professionals they have would indicate they could serve -- since 1988 they have not lost one person to tuberculosis not one 
we're essentially implementing what paul farmer did in haiti he develops and trains paid community health workers who are able to identify health problems ensure that people who have aids or tb are properly diagnosed and take their medicine regularly who work on bringing about health education clean water and sanitation providing nutritional supplements and moving people up the chain of health care if they have problems of the severity that require it 
the procedures that make this work have been perfected as i said by paul farmer and his team in their work in rural haiti over the last 20 years 
and the results were so good that the rwandan government has now agreed to adopt the model for the entire country and has strongly supported and put the full resources of the government behind it 
and then we have others working in these other related programs 
so she now works full-time on this for very little pay 
and not a single soul in this area was being treated for aids or tuberculosis 
listen to this less than four-tenths of one percent of those being treated stopped taking their medicine or otherwise defaulted on treatment 
we're now working with partners in health and the ministry of health in rwanda and our foundation folks to scale this system up 
we need initial upfront investment to train doctors nurses health administration and community health workers throughout the country to set up the information technology the solar energy the water and sanitation the transportation infrastructure 
i had a really hard time in school 
in fact my mother told me eventually that i was the little kid in the village who cried all the way to school 
i ran away 
and when the natural breeze isn't enough the kids deploy bubbles but not the kind of bubbles you know 
they know they can control their world 
landscaping 
they're part of the rice cycle and these skills will be valuable for them in their future 
the food is incredible 
green school is a place of pioneers local and global 
the kids are from 25 countries 
you practice ancient balinese arts 
the kids love it 
and together these volunteers and the teachers are deeply committed to creating a new generation of global green leaders 
the green school effect -- we don't know what it is 
and how did we do all this 
it's a double helix 
from the time the foundations were finished in three months it had roofs and floors 
you ruined my life but you gave me an incredible future 
and then a third attempt which also patched me back together pretty well until it failed 
i tried out various computer voices that were available online and for several months i had a british accent which chaz called sir lawrence 
there are all sorts of html codes you can use to control the timing and inflection of computer voices and i've experimented with them 
but what value do we place on the sound of our own voice 
but it wasn't that simple 
or roger 20 
this is the first version of my computer voice 
when i read something it will read in my voice 
the voice was created by a company in scotland named cereproc 
i plan to use it on television radio and the internet 
people who need a voice should know that most computers already come with built-in speaking systems 
john hunter all my life i was a motormouth 
i doubt on that day 50 years ago they even dreamed of what salman khan has accomplished 
but that's not the point 
i have learned from wikipedia that starting with that humble beginning plato established forums message boards online testing email chat rooms picture languages instant messaging remote screen sharing and multiple-player games 
but online everybody speaks at the same speed 
ironic that my legs are fine and it's my shoulders that slow up my walk 
when you see me today i look like the phantom of the opera 
i’d like to dedicate this one to all the women in south africa -- those women who refused to dwindle in the midst of apartheid

let me tell you my story 
i came to london and i've seen performance by cirque du soleil 
i wanted my artistic statement my interpretation of reality 
the secret is that we were treating the whole newspaper as one piece as one composition -- like music 
and design is responsible for this experience 
what really makes it amazing that the circulation of these newspapers were growing too 
same in poland plus 13 up to 35 percent raise of circulation after three years 
you can work for a small company in a boring branch 
so bear with me as i take you through this journey 
i was running across the street and the only thing that i actually remember is feeling like a grenade went off in my head 
and i remember putting my hands on the ground and feeling my life's blood emptying out of my neck and my mouth 
i had no idea what was going on but strangers intervened kept my heart moving beating 
i had lots of titanium put in me cadaver bones to try to get my feet moving the right way 
and i needed that wisdom at that moment in my life 
so they eventually started matching their talents and skills to all of my needs 
so they figured not being able to see is one thing but they need to get me to talk 
the redundancy was actually good for me 
so everything is different when you're a sighted person because you take that for granted 
we didn't have words like crowd-sourcing and radical collaboration when i had my accident 
a peasant who was walking to market that morning ran towards where the gunshot had come from and found a young man writhing in agony on the floor clearly shot by a dueling wound 
galois was taken to the local hospital where he died the next day in the arms of his brother 
and the last words he said to his brother were don't cry for me alfred 
but a few years earlier while still at school he'd actually cracked one of the big mathematical problems at the time 
symmetry can also help us to explain what's happening in the large hadron collider in cern 
artists too love to play around with symmetry 
here is thomas mann talking about symmetry in the magic mountain 
and the gateway you see behind has eight columns with beautiful symmetrical designs on them 
and i said to professor kurokawa wow the architects must have really been kicking themselves when they realized that they'd made a mistake and put this one upside down 
recently i took my family -- we do these rather kind of nerdy mathematical trips which my family love 
i think one of the problems about school mathematics is it doesn't look at how mathematics is embedded in the world we live in 
so they explored a more geometric art 
and the power of mathematics is often to change one thing into another to change geometry into language 
actually the invention of the number zero was a very modern concept seventh century ad by the indians 
i can reflect it in the line through x or the line through y or the line through z 
so both of these objects have six symmetries 
so the little table here records how the algebra of these symmetries work 
and this enables us to distinguish why the symmetries of these objects -- they both have six symmetries so why shouldn't we say they have the same symmetries 
and using those rules he was able to say that there are in fact only two objects with six symmetries 
and all the tiles match up again 
so there was a sixth of a turn a third of a turn where the z pieces meet 
how many symmetries does a rubik's cube have 
rather than you all shouting out i want you to count how many digits there are in that number okay 
because this one i think there were a few here 
the people who just last sat down 
and i'd like to review just how unintended consequences play the part that they do 
but he did his best and he kept meticulous records that let him transform that branch of medicine 
so there were benefits in calamities -- benefits to pure science as well as to applied science and medicine 
there are two historians of business at the university of maryland brent goldfarb and david kirsch who have done some extremely interesting work much of it still unpublished on the history of major innovations 
they have combined the list of major innovations and they've discovered that the greatest number the greatest decade for fundamental innovations as reflected in all of the lists that others have made -- a number of lists that they have merged -- was the great depression 
so we see that sometimes as a result of these dislocations as a result of people leaving their original intended career and going into something else where their creativity could make a difference that depressions and all kinds of other unfortunate events can have a paradoxically stimulating effect on creativity 
we need to see what they can do for us 
it's kind of like a new approach to desktop computing 
and some of those we wanted to transfer to the icons in our system 
also just like paper around our workspace we'll pin things up to the wall to remember them later and i can do the same thing here and you know you'll see post-it notes and things like that around people's offices 
so one thing we have for that is like a grid align kind of -- so you get that more traditional desktop things are kind of grid aligned 
the photo was made when we were deep in the valley over there 
but i think the point is that this is metaphor with teeth and it's with those teeth that i want to propose today that we rethink a little bit about the role of contemporary math -- not just financial math but math in general 
and he said it's funny you ask that because it's actually called black box trading 
there's a company in boston called nanex and they use math and magic and i don't know what and they reach into all the market data and they find actually sometimes some of these algorithms 
and when they find them they pull them out and they pin them to the wall like butterflies 
pragmatic chaos is like all of netflix algorithms trying to do the same thing 
pragmatic chaos like all netflix algorithms determines in the end 60 percent of what movies end up being rented 
wouldn't that be handy 
and it uses what's called a bin-packing algorithm 
and this is really where the wires come right up into the city 
but before i dive into those i want to admit that i am an optimist 
and part of the reason i feel that way is looking at the past 
another statistic perhaps my favorite is to look at childhood deaths 
the next breakthrough is to cut that 10 million in half again 
why well there's only a few diseases that account for the vast majority of those deaths diarrhea pneumonia and malaria 
and the disease was all over the world 
and two tools helped bring the death rate down 
but malaria -- even the million deaths a year caused by malaria greatly understate its impact 
over 200 million people at any one time are suffering from it 
and bed nets are a great tool 
so every tool that we've ever had in the past has eventually become ineffective 
it involves communicators to keep the funding high to keep the visibility high to tell the success stories 
it involves social scientists so we know how to get not just 70 percent of the people to use the bed nets but 90 percent 
it seems like the kind of question that people would spend a lot of time on and we'd understand very well 
let's start with why this is important 
not only has that been weak it's getting weaker 
and the answer is no 
but it in no way is associated with being a better teacher 
they have 66 schools -- mostly middle schools some high schools -- and what goes on is great teaching 
if you have a kid who's behind you would know you could assign them that video to watch and review the concept 
i'm going to send everyone here a free copy of this book 
i only have three minutes so i'm going to have to talk fast and it will use up your spare mental cycles so multitasking may be hard 
so it's logical that you'd have one there on the minor road entering the major 
and so the question is what does that cost us 
that's just the gasoline cost there is also pollution wear on the car and time 
discount that back to the present at five percent over two million dollars for a stop sign in each direction 
now if you look at what that adjacent property is worth you could actually buy the property cut down the shrubbery to improve the sight line and then sell it off again 
and because we no longer need to use sunlight we have very specialized lights that are made for the operating room 
and this is what i think is the magic of fluorescence 
that's what the surgeon is saying in the operating room when the patient's on the table 
but then we actually don't know that it's all out 
and we wait 
so now you're faced with telling your patient first of all that they may need another surgery or that they need additional therapy such as radiation or chemotherapy 
so even if the tumor is not right on the surface you'll still be able to see it 
so if you're driving on the freeway and you want to know where's the next gas station you have a map to tell you that that gas station is down the road 
so with our technology we can tell right away 
nerves if they are injured can cause paralysis can cause pain 
but you know what these little nerves are so small in the context of prostate cancer that they are actually never seen 
people said we've been doing it this way for all these years 
but i went ahead anyway 
we have been able to see nerves for facial expression for facial movement for breathing -- every single nerve -- nerves for urinary function around the prostate 
i have patients who would benefit from this 
i think that this will result in my surgeries with a better outcome and fewer complications 
and this takes the long-term steady courage of the day-in day-out struggle to educate to persuade and to win acceptance 
and that is the light that i want to shine on health and medicine today 
they receive input from thousands of upstream partners and compute their own electrical outputs which then if they pass a certain threshold will go to thousands of downstream partners 
if we could activate cells we could see what powers they can unleash what they can initiate and sustain 
now in the 20th century there was some hope that was generated through the development of pharmaceuticals for treating brain disorders and while many drugs have been developed that can alleviate symptoms of brain disorders practically none of them can be considered to be cured 
there's one other magic trick you need to make this all happen and that's the ability to get light into the brain 
so how do we do this 
and one of the things that we did was to adopt a very classical model of fear 
and over time -- in this case a mouse which is a good animal model commonly used in such experiments -- the animal learns to fear the tone 
the animal will react by freezing sort of like a deer in the headlights 
now i want to close on one story which we think is another possibility -- which is that maybe these molecules if you can do ultra-precise control can be used in the brain itself to make a new kind of prosthetic an optical prosthetic 
maybe 100000 people have cochlear implants which allow them to hear 
and new hope in gene therapy has been developed because viruses like the adeno-associated virus which probably most of us around this room have and it doesn't have any symptoms which have been used in hundreds of patients to deliver genes into the brain or the body 
and the retina of course is a complex structure 
we're going to take these blue light photosensors and install them on a layer of cells in the middle of the retina in the back of the eye and convert them into a camera -- just like installing solar cells all over those neurons to make them light sensitive 
so this pre-clinical study i think bodes hope for the kinds of things we're hoping to do in the future 
and by turning things off it's more or less a zero 
does that mean that some day you could download memories and maybe upload them 
what determines the types and distributions of microbes indoors 
and we looked at three different types of rooms 
hospitals use two and a half times the amount of energy as office buildings 
i've heard somebody say that you're as healthy as your gut 
and obviously i'm physically a very strong person as you can tell --  -- so i wasn't worried about carrying this thing 20 blocks 
people were out 
and i thought well this is the power of a city 
but the system itself of this city was thriving 
everybody contributes a little bit 
well it was the whole city 
so it's been a very optimistic time i think and i want to just talk about a few of those things 
that is -- you know there's no sentence that kind of conjures up that period better than that i think which is that you suddenly have the power to put up a picture of your dog and link to it and somebody reading the page has the power to click on that link or not click on that link 
but it's still a very one-to-one kind of relationship 
about two months ago i had the great breakthrough -- one of my great kind of shining achievements -- which is that my website finally became a top result for steven johnson 
and in fact i think that's not entirely true anymore 
that little list there would change 
that's not necessarily something we didn't know already 
i had no idea 
but what's interesting is you can then broaden the search and actually see interesting things and get a sense of what else is out there 
they're talking about slavery in 1860 
and ok i didn't learn anything new there as well -- that's pretty obvious 
i'll go very quickly 
it's caused a lot of controversy because people thought that this was the ultimate kind of one man one modem democracy where anybody can get out there and get their voice heard 
and the question was were the birds singing 
well in my world this is a rubber duck 
that was a nice thing to get 
if the end game is global warming they're doing great 
so perhaps we could develop a strategy of change which requires humility and in my business as an architect it's unfortunate the word humility and the word architect have not appeared in the same paragraph since the fountainhead 
there is an infinite game and we're playing in that infinite game 
and so we call it cradle to cradle and our goal is very simple 
this is what i presented to the white house 
so we've designed products and we analyzed chemicals down to the parts per million 
we can ask ourselves what is justice and is justice blind or is justice blindness 
is there anybody here who doesn't breathe 
here's dr venkataswamy in india who's figured out how to do mass-produced health 
they become building steel 
my childhood summers were in the puget sound of washington among the first growth and big growth 
my grandfather had been a lumberjack in the olympics so i have a lot of tree karma i am working off 
so all of a sudden here i am graduating from high school in 1969 and this happens and we realize that away went away 
now if we look at the word competition i'm sure most of you've used it 
you know most people don't realize it comes from the latin competere which means strive together 
it means the way olympic athletes train with each other 
so we've been looking at the idea of competition as a way of cooperating in order to get fit together 
now most environmentalists don't say growth is good because in our lexicon asphalt is two words assigning blame 
technical nutrition will be in an order of magnitude of biological nutrition 
customers 
biotechnical nutrients -- the model u for ford motor a cradle to cradle car -- concept car 
the idea here of the car is that some of the materials go back to the industry forever some of the materials go back to soil -- it's all solar-powered 
we're doing 12 cities for china right now based on cradle to cradle as templates 
our assignment is to develop protocols for the housing for 400 million people in 12 years 
we start to integrate commercial and mixed use so the people all have centers and places to be 
and then it makes natural gas which then goes back into the city to power the fuel for the cooking for the city 
and then the compost is all taken back to the roofs of the city where we've got farming because what we've done is lifted up the city the landscape into the air to -- to restore the native landscape on the roofs of the buildings 
they're probably less cell dense 
and they're controlling basically everything that the nervous system has to do 
because what we're trying to measure the rna -- which is the readout from our genes -- is very labile and so we have to move very quickly 
and then the laser actually cuts 
now this may look like a bunch of dots to you but each one of these individual dots is actually a unique piece of the human genome that we spotted down on glass 
and when we take a sample and we hybridize it to it we get a unique fingerprint if you will quantitatively of what genes are turned on in that sample 
so roughly we have 50 million data points for a given human brain 
green is the sort of cool areas where it's not turned on 
genes send the instructions to make proteins 
so drugs bind to proteins and either turn them off etc 
it's as interesting a side effect as it could be 
one other thing you can do with such a thing is you can because it's a pattern matching exercise because there's unique fingerprint we can actually scan through the entire genome and find other proteins that show a similar fingerprint 
now they can come in and they can start to get clues about activity 
and then we find some outliers some things that lie beyond the cloud 
and those genes are interesting but they're very subtle 
these are things where genes are turned on in an individual cell type 
i think these resources are incredibly valuable 
and there is something else i believe in the back of your mind you also know 
and worst of all we will never know 
and the reason is that -- take africa for example 
africans have already got a lot of aid 
we don't know 
and a third question education 
and in this way you can take the guesswork out of policy-making by knowing what works what doesn't work and why 
it's going from intention to action 
we cannot keep giving lentils to people 
we can just run an experiment 
second thing is how about the use 
well in business that's certainly not the way we would go about it 
now i'm going to show you what we get with various education interventions 
so now i started from the big problem and i couldn't answer it 
in haiti about 200000 people died -- actually a bit more by the latest estimate 
so why is that 
with deworming you can get an extra year of education for three dollars 
so this evidence is powerful 
it can prompt action 
these economics i'm proposing it's like 20th century medicine 
fantastic tales anecdotes from speakers 
and turnarounds are part and parcel of what i have focused on for most of my professional career 
and she said i want to write a case euvin -- a case on a public-sector leader that has lessons for the corporate world 
the first thing that i saw was north america at night -- glowing in all its glory a warm feeling light 
entrepreneurs dynamic people people with hope 
so let's start shedding light on this amazing eclectic continent that has so much to offer 
so i want to share with you some of these bellwether signals or signs and winds of change that are sweeping this continent 
and let's start at the high level on the macro-factors 
egypt from the 16 percent to about 84 percent 
but what were they there for to acquire assets 
guarantee trust bank recently issued the first euro bond out of africa and this excludes south africa 
22 to 24 million barrels of oil a day -- the same league as kuwait the same league as venezuela 
so let's unpack those very quickly and i'm going to move through these very very very fast because i can see that clock counting down 
what else is going on there egypt 
close to the mediterranean near alexandria -- textiles petrochemicals 
so what are the signs that things are fundamentally changing 
what's going on in some of the other countries 
but in any investment decision the key question is what is my alternative investment 
now when looking at africa vis-a-vis other things and countries in africa vis-a-vis other things comparisons become important 
in 1899 joseph conrad released the heart of darkness a tale of grim horror along the congo river 
brain magic to me indicates that area of magic dealing with psychological and mind-reading effects 
so now you can see how easy it is for me to manipulate the human mind once you know how 
no but you're ok yes 
that is weird 
thank you 
now i'm going to give you some demonstrations up here live right now 
and let's see down at the end here can you also come up real quick 
now it's very important for everybody here to realize i haven't set anything up with you guys 
you don't know what's about to happen is that agreed 
ok would you mind just standing over here for a moment 
your name is 
ok a little bit closer come over -- they look really nervous up here 
voodoo 
besides who's next no ok 
i want you to be aware of the sensations but don't say anything until i ask you and don't open your eyes until i ask you 
yes or no did you feel anything 
yeah i walk around nightclubs all night like this 
and can you take a seat right over here for me if you don't mind 
and i want you to hold it there just for a moment and i only want you to allow your hand to sink and drift and float back to the tabletop at the same rate and speed as you drift and float into this relaxed state of awareness and allow it to go all the way down to the tabletop 
ok and only when you feel the pressure go back i want you to allow your hand to slowly drift back to the tabletop but only when you feel the pressure 
allow it to stick firmly to the tabletop keep your eyes closed 
can you stand up 
imagine a connection between you and him 
point directly at his forehead 
now i want you to be aware that in a moment when i snap my fingers your eyes will open again 
it's nearly impossible to break a coke bottle 
you see psychokinesis is the paranormal influence of the mind on physical events and processes 
be careful because it is sharp just hold on to it for a moment 
and i want you to release that negative energy by shaking it from side to side 
there's five letters in the title 
there's a k in his name there is a k 
you knew 
no one in the audience and just to help you out i'll block them from view so nobody can see what you're doing 
but i don't want you to know either so swivel around on your chair 
your right hand is that -- no ok 
ok tell me when to stop 
yes there's one 
ok do you think it's here yes or no 
neither oh ok 
we're the only creatures with fully developed moral sentiments 
after 10 years of experiments i found it 
it can't be that important 
turns out it wasn't so easy 
and when it's produced it has a three-minute half-life and degrades rapidly at room temperature 
then i had to measure morality 
so i started smaller 
so poor countries are by and large low trust countries 
so we recruit some people for an experiment 
we give them lots of instruction and we never ever deceive them 
so think about this experiment for minute 
but why 
two things 
i didn't know for sure oxytocin caused trustworthiness 
i used everything short of a drill to get oxytocin into my own brain 
these include massage dancing and praying 
in this book smith argued that we are moral creatures not because of a top-down reason but for a bottom-up reason 
so if i do something that hurts you i feel that pain 
i'm working at a gas station on the outskirts of santa barbara california 
tell that guy to wait half an hour 
so this is a classic con called the pigeon drop and i was the pigeon 
they have many of the attributes of psychopaths 
one is through improper nurturing 
so we've studied sexually abused women and about half those don't release oxytocin on stimulus 
she had the biggest increase in oxytocin 
so i think it tells us that we've designed this ritual to connect us to this new couple connect us emotionally 
so my penchant for hugging other people has earned me the nickname dr love 
we have found that people who release more oxytocin are happier 
and they're happier because they have better relationships of all types 
i'll play at these rock shows be on stage standing completely still and they're like what's she doing what's she doing 
so basically with both of your hands you're controlling pitch and volume and kind of trying to create the illusion that you're doing separate notes when really it's continuously going  
maybe we'll go into the next tune because i totally lost where this is going 
it was invented around the 1920s and the inventor léon theremin -- he also was a musician besides an inventor -- he came up with the idea for making the theremin i think when he was working on some shortwave radios 
and then also you're trying to stay very very very still because little movements with other parts of your body will affect the pitch or sometimes if you're holding a low note --  -- and breathing will make it  
and it's meant to kind of reflect how we engage with histories or stories on the internet in a less linear form 
he was sent in 1907 to palestine by the zionist organization to look at areas for jewish settlement and acquire land for jewish settlement 
during the course of this trial all of the rabbits died except for a few which were euthanized 
so when you look at a detail of this work you can see the man on the upper-left is the father of the woman sitting next to him 
during the time i was in bosnia the mortal remains of zumra's eldest son were exhumed from a mass grave 
however the other individuals are represented by these blue slides which show tooth and bone samples that were matched to dna evidence collected from family members to prove they were the identities of those individuals 
there's also parents who participated who wouldn't let their children participate because they thought they were too young to decide for themselves 
it was released in poland to create friction between frank and hitler so that hitler would imagine frank was trying to usurp his power 
again talking about fate i was interested in the stories and fate of particular works of art 
chapter 12 highlights people being born into a battle that is not of their making but becomes their own 
i'm not quite sure whether i really want to see a snare drum at nine o'clock or so in the morning 
and it sounds quite simple but actually it's quite a big big job 
i will follow the instructions the tempo markings the dynamics 
but here i'm being told that the piece of music is very quick 
just the basic feeling 
we have to listen to ourselves first of all 
and i just feel at last one with the stick and one with the drum 
not just translate them but interpret them 
can be felt with just the tiniest part of your finger there 
every single one of us depending on where we're sitting will experience this sound quite quite differently 
do you see what i mean so because of this explosion in access to sound especially through the deaf community this has not only affected how music institutions how schools for the deaf treat sound -- and not just as a means of therapy -- although of course being a participator of music that definitely is the case as well 
may be great there but terrible up there 
we just -- we go like that and we imagine that that's what deafness is about 
in a year's time it could be two extra steps 
for me as a musician who deals with 99 percent of new music it's very easy for me to say oh yes i like that piece 
oh no i don't like that piece and so on 
and please try to create that through your clapping try just -- please try 
very good snow snow have you ever heard snow 
evelyn glennie well then stop clapping  try again 
see you're awake 
however not one of you got out of your seats to think right how can i clap ok maybe   
i may feel sorrowful or happy or exhilarated or angry when i play certain pieces of music but i'm not necessarily wanting you to feel exactly the same thing 
the performer is in the worst possible position for the actual sound because they're hearing the contact of the stick on the drum or the mallet on the bit of wood or the bow on the string etc or the breath that's creating the sound from wind and brass 
it's a video game move from star fox 
and we've gone from one board to 48 boards 
what the site's known for because it has this environment is it's fostered the creation of a lot of internet phenomena viral videos and whatnot known as memes 
and so there are three that i want to show you specifically 
it is where a third of all the traffic is going 
they got it taken offline and managed to piss off part of the internet 
so we've got this activist group that's this grassroots group that's come out of the site 
dusty is the name that we've given to this cat 
we're sacrificing a lot of that and i think in doing so moving towards those things we're losing something valuable 
you're lucky that this is not being streamed to them live right now 
well you never know some of them -- we've got people in 75 countries out there watching 
don't tell 
and saying whatever you like i think is powerful 
and the thing is i didn't make it into that presentation because i can't read to you anything that they said more or less 
okay well 
you've got this surprising semi-underground influence but it's not making you a lot of money yet 
yeah they still didn't know what to think of that though 
within five 10 million years of the bolide impact we had a whole variety of animals going into the water why didn't they do that 
you want to measure it by diversity 
this slide was shown before this is the famous jurassic bird archaeopteryx 
if we could roll that first video clip 
but one with an immense chalkboard in the middle with lots of little areas of dinosaur rock if you could survive an expedition 
and the kinds of teams they bring in 
so you are finding yourself also in an amazing cultural milieu 
you're really rubbing shoulders with the world's last great nomadic people 
here's the animal that was causing it trouble 
it is an incredible view of life and it really began when we began to understand the depth of time 
we prototyped by cat-scanning the brain out of this animal 
now this field is just -- and of course science in general -- is just -- adventure 
narrator if they can just land it this croc will provide useful data helping paul in his quest to understand sarcosuchus 
i've got it i've got the back legs 
paul sereno let's get this tape measure on him put it right there 
wow 
anyway you find other things too 
these are all landlubbing animals there's a couple of choices 
and you take those four instances and you realize you have a complex problem 
they did it within two or three degrees of the pole to maintain similarity between continents 
now we have divergence over time but we've created the third dimension of area 
i was a total failure in school not really headed to graduate high school 
what about all the kids like me that were in school -- kids like some of you out there -- that were in school and didn't get a chance and will never get a chance to participate in science and technology 
because when you go out there as a scholar and you try to find out longitudinal studies track records like that there essentially are very few if none 
thank you very much 
and as a little girl i loved the idea of a robot that interacted with us much more like a helpful trusted sidekick -- something that would delight us enrich our lives and help us save a galaxy or two 
i almost lost it this week 
leo this is cookie monster 
we looked at psychological involvement -- how much empathy did you feel for the other person 
we looked at their desire to cooperate 
today we know that families are living further and further apart and that definitely takes a toll on family relationships and family bonds over distance 
and as grandma-bot she can now play really play with my sons with her grandsons in the real world with his real toys 
another was a computer that ran the same touch-screen interface ran exactly the same dialogues 
the quality of advice was identical 
we've invited a lot of kids into this space and they think it's pretty cool 
that's her competition 
paula radcliffe the one person who is sure to snatch the big paycheck out of derartu tulu's under-underdog hands suddenly grabs her leg and starts to fall back 
they're not doing 26 miles they're doing 100 150 miles at a time and apparently without injury without problems 
and if you know it then you are smarter than anybody else on planet earth 
australopithecus had a tiny little pea brain 
the only problem is the first edged weapons only appeared about 200000 years ago 
we're not fast 
her uterus would be torn 
then you go beyond 26 miles into the distance that medical science also told us would be fatal to humans -- remember pheidippides died when he ran 26 miles -- you get to 50 and 100 miles and suddenly it's a different game 
well emily baer -- 500 runners -- she finishes in eighth place in the top 10 even though she stopped at all the aid stations to breastfeed her baby during the race -- and yet beat 492 other people 
and you'll get slower and slower until eventually you're back to running the same speed you were at age 19 
now i defy you to come up with any other physical activity -- and please don't say golf -- something that actually is hard -- where geriatrics are performing as well as they did as teenagers 
maybe we evolved as a hunting pack animal 
well if that's true a couple other things had to be true as well 
the key to being part of a hunting pack is the word pack 
you need to have those 27-year-old studs at the peak of their powers ready to drop the kill and you need to have those teenagers there who are learning the whole thing all involved 
you can't be hauling all your crap around trying to chase the antelope 
he pissed me off let him go chase his own antelope 
geronimo used to say that my only friends are my legs i only trust my legs 
that's because an apache triathlon used to be you'd run 50 miles across the desert engage in hand-to-hand combat steal a bunch of horses and slap leather for home 
i didn't do yoga i'm not ready 
so hopefully it's something we can all benefit from 
i show a number of photographs and films but i also make television programs books and some advertising all with the same concept 
i was fascinated by this phenomenon so i wondered could one erase the image of diana actually quite crudely and physically 
momentum was being built 
i then went on wondering whether i could actually replace her image so i got a look-alike of diana and posed her in the right positions and angles and created something that was in or existed in the public imagination 
so this is an image of diana looking at camilla kissing her husband and this was a sequence of images 
all this imagery was creating a lot of fuss and i was cited as a disgusting artist the press were writing about this giving full pages about how terrible this was 
but then this changed suddenly 
i was sitting next to someone at dinner the other day and they were saying there's this great image of the queen sitting outside william hill 
i explored with actually dressing up as the celebrities myself 
and me as the queen 
i then continued on to make a whole body of work about marilyn -- the biggest icon of all -- and trying to titillate by shooting through doorways and shutters and so on and so forth and only showing certain angles to create a reality that obviously is completely constructed 
i did an advertising campaign for schweppes which is coca-cola and so that was very interesting in terms of the legalities 
tony blair and cherie and again the legalities -- we had to be very careful 
and the press were interviewing and i was signing my book  
and in fact george bush and tony blair are having great fun during all of this 
so there was a lot of meaning in my life because i was performing this type of research during the day 
my left hemisphere -- our left hemisphere -- is a very different place 
our left hemisphere is all about the past and it's all about the future 
it's that ongoing brain chatter that connects me and my internal world to my external world 
i become a single solid individual separate from the energy flow around me and separate from you 
and i looked down at my body and i thought whoa i'm a weird-looking thing and it was as though my consciousness had shifted away from my normal perception of reality where i'm the person on the machine having the experience to some esoteric space where i'm witnessing myself having this experience 
i can't define where i begin and where i end because the atoms and the molecules of my arm blended with the atoms and molecules of the wall 
and then i would wait for what i call a wave of clarity 
and so i say to him -- clear in my mind i say to him this is jill i need help 
nirvana i found nirvana and i remember thinking there's no way i would ever be able to squeeze the enormousness of myself back inside this tiny little body 
two and a half weeks after the hemorrhage the surgeons went in and they removed a blood clot the size of a golf ball that was pushing on my language centers 
i believe that the more time we spend choosing to run the deep inner-peace circuitry of our right hemispheres the more peace we will project into the world and the more peaceful our planet will be 
in africa -- where it is a major killer -- it is totally ignored 
no you will die 50 percent will die within 24 hours if not treated 
if you cannot secure the parents you cannot guarantee the security of the african child 
these are just for information hypertension diabetes obesity lack of exercise the usual suspects 
so they spend their money trying to fix those problems 
so for a radiopharmaceutical in the us -- that you'll get a unit dose for 250 dollars -- when we're finished manufacturing it in-house we come at a price of about two dollars 
this is at the heart institute the doctors from anywhere can log in 
they'll give me that information and we'll make the care of the patient better 
because if you can't get it in nashville you can travel to birmingham two hours away and you'll get it if you can't get it in cleveland you can go to cincinnati we don't have that luxury so we have to make it happen 
so we emphasize training training is critical 
sharon lazarus i am an echocardiographer at the heart institute of the caribbean since the past two years i received training at this institution 
i think i'll start out and just talk a little bit about what exactly autism is 
i'm really concerned that a lot of the schools have taken out the hands-on classes because art and classes like that those are the classes where i excelled 
i thought everybody thought in pictures 
ok there is my childhood church that's specific there's some more fort collins 
but one of the things that really worries me is where's the younger version of those kids going today 
and then there's a verbal mind they know every fact about everything 
and i came in half an hour beforehand so i could have it put on and kind of get used to it and they got it bent so it's not hitting my chin 
because think about it an animal is a sensory-based thinker not verbal -- thinks in pictures thinks in sounds thinks in smells 
are they friend or foe is there anybody he can go mate with 
there's a ton of information on that fire hydrant 
now this ability to put information into categories i find a lot of people are not very good at this 
i find a lot of people have difficulty doing that 
is it a minor problem with something simple i can fix 
yeah i'm a million-mile flyer 
i do lots and lots of flying and if i was at the faa what would i be doing a lot of direct observation of 
it would be their airplane tails 
i was a goofball student when i was in high school i just didn't care at all about studying until i had mr carlock's science class 
and they're not going down the right path 
but you know what i was getting work experience 
in other words use that fixation in order to motivate that kid that's one of the things we need to do 
the pattern thinkers they're the ones that are going to be your mathematicians your software engineers your computer programmers all of those kinds of jobs 
because the thing about being autistic is i had to learn social skills like being in a play 
i cannot emphasize enough what my science teacher did for me 
well first of all you've got to look at age 
how many cattle got poked with the prodder 
temple can i just say it's an absolute delight to have you at ted 
okay 
bye-bye 
when they were a bunch of kids they were kind of very imaginative very adventurous as they were trying at caltech to mix chemicals and see which one blows up more 
so that's what we call our first five employees during the tea break you know in here 
and that was done over a period of a couple of years and now we are the leading organization you know exploring space on all of your behalf 
but even when we did that we had to remind ourselves sometimes there are setbacks 
but then also just to celebrate that we started an event at jpl for miss guided missile 
maybe they're right - i doubt it 
so next time you are really depressed look in the mirror and you can look and say hi i'm looking at a star here 
so it is a dynamic planet and activity is going on as we speak today 
as i told you geologists love craters 
if you were there you wouldn't do it yourself 
and that's what we found out it turned out that every once in a while there are dust devils which come by on mars as you are seeing here and when the dust devil comes over the rover it just cleans it up 
yeah 
it's the first mission that's going to try to land near the north pole of mars and it's the first mission that's actually going to try and reach out and touch water on the surface of another planet 
the outside can get almost as hot as the surface of the sun 
the temperature of the heat shield can reach 2600 degrees fahrenheit 
the fabric and the stitching could just pull apart 
we kick them we hit them we drop them just to make sure we understand how where would they break 
and i know many of you kind of last time afterwards said well that was a cool thing to have -- those airbags 
it's real stuff 
so the idea is by watching saturn we're actually watching our solar system in real time being formed on a smaller scale so it's like a test bed for it 
now you think that those rings are very large objects 
that was [unclear] also -- you know because we were worried about the risk of it but it worked pretty well 
so people believe now that titan is most likely what we call a pre-biotic planet because it's so cold organic material did not get to the stage of becoming biological material and therefore life could have evolved on it 
so here we have a cycle of a planet which is like our earth but is all made of ethane and methane and organic material 
and being the current day of course we started our own facebook group 
now why am i telling you this story and what does this have to do with the future of health 
what i'd like to talk about today is understanding these exponential technologies 
and coming up next month is actually future med a program to help cross-train and leverage technologies into medicine 
these mobile phones have over 20000 different mobile apps available -- to the point where there's one out of the uk 
let's start with faster 
we can look inside with real time fmri -- in the brain at real time 
the scan in a couple of years will be one terabyte or 800000 books 
and now of course we're in the era of the ipad even the ipad 2 
the ability to interact with your health care provider is different 
consumers now can buy basically hundred-dollar devices like this little fitbit 
so a few examples we're now in the era of fantastic voyage the ipill 
and this is really going to leverage technology to the rural and the under-served and enable what used to be thousand-dollar tests to be done at pennies and at the point of care 
my data indicates that i've got about average risk for developing macular degeneration a kind of blindness 
i'm at almost twice the risk for type ii diabetes 
it might change my behavior 
we can capture that information 
this has been called by lee hood the father of the field p4 medicine 
how about more targeted therapies for cancer 
now i'll close with regenerative medicine 
geron just last year started the first trial using human embryonic stem cells to treat spinal cord injuries 
still a phase i trial but evolving 
i thought i would read poems i have that relate to the subject of youth and age 
my grandmother is washing my mouth out with soap half a long century gone and still she comes at me with that thick cruel yellow bar 
it's a longer poem 
it's called the neighbor 
her shadow once fumbling the chain on her door then the door slamming fearfully shut only the barking and the music -- jazz -- filtering as it does day and night into the hall 
my thinking we'd meet recognize one another become friends that i'd accomplish a penance 
sometimes there are frightening goings-on in the stairwell 
medea she was next time i saw her 
my holding the door 
instead i'd step into my train 
the dance of our glances the clash pulling each other through our perceptual punctures then holocaust holocaust host on host of ill injured presences squandered consumed 
the dance of our glances challenge abdication effacement the perfume of our consternation 
forever with grace 
but i'm afraid that ricky will come out here and shake his fist at me 
special big tits says the advertisement for a soft-core magazine on our neighborhood newsstand 
but forget her breasts 
the display was a photo men and women stripped naked some trying to cover their genitals others too frightened to bother lined up in snow waiting to be shot and thrown into a ditch 
what carnal mistrust had their teacher taught them 
the truth is that we know that the images themselves don't change the world but we're also aware that since the beginning of photography images have provoked reactions in people and those reactions have caused change to happen 
it changed our view of the physical world 
some would argue that it is those images that did more to fuel the insurgency in iraq than virtually any other single act 
in fact these images became the voices of protest themselves 
i was the only human being in an area one-and-a-half times the size of america five-and-a-half thousand square miles 
ben i've read somewhere that at minus 40 exposed skin becomes frostbitten in less than a minute so how do you answer the call of nature 
third one how do you top that what's next 
i was 23 years old no one my age had attempted anything like this and pretty quickly almost everything that could have gone wrong did go wrong 
i had frostbite in my left big toe 
you can just see -- there's a nine and a string of zeros here 
i dialed three numbers i dialed my mum 
the -- the whole world underneath me 
there are huge areas of open water just south of your position 
antarctica if you include the ice shelves is twice the size of australia -- it's a big place 
and they turned around headed back to the coast and all five of them died on the return journey 
where was this guilt trip coming from 
there was one person in the group that was supposed to have very high performance that was actually performing terribly 
and he pulled the whole mean down destroying my statistical significance of the test 
so i looked carefully at this guy 
and i'm sure that it's something that we all recognize and we see that it happens 
and that's a much much more difficult lesson to take into account 
in my mind i was actually a knight trying to help science move along 
i mean this is all very depressing right -- people have conflicts of interest we don't see it and so on 
this is actually a direct quote from an epidemiologist who's been in field of hiv for 15 years worked on four continents and you're looking at her 
and so everyone lined up all the smackheads in a row and the guy whose birthday it was filled up the fit and he went down and started injecting people 
so his choice was either to accept that dirty needle or not to get high 
so what's that about is it like you get a better high if you share or something 
so she was making a politically rational decision 
i've always been a bit curious about that because i think stigma is a bad thing whereas lots of sex is quite a good thing but we'll leave that be 
of course you can't get hiv just by having unprotected sex 
and again it's because of an alignment of the incentives 
and actually clients don't want to go home with a drip either 
he's from haiti and he has aids 
and the other thing is that people are simply not as scared of hiv as they were of aids and rightly so 
we've got the tools the knowledge and the cash and commitment to preventing hiv too 
there are as many different ways of being rational as there are human beings on the planet and that's one of the glories of human existence 
ten years ago exactly i was in afghanistan 
would you like to see civil war sectarian killing 
they found something called facebook 
this is what they were telling this is their propaganda 
and this is how the revolution was born in tunisia 
but we found that these people in the street all of them are our reporters feeding our newsroom with pictures with videos and with news 
we are going to be the voice for these voiceless people 
be aware of these people who [are] coming to you in order to ruin your great civilization 
they have been detached from their people from the masses and now we are seeing them collapsing one after the other 
i felt the responsibility to phone our correspondents there and to phone our newsroom and to tell them make your best not to switch off the cameras at night because the guys there really feel confident when someone is reporting their story -- and they feel protected as well 
we have a chance to go and to think of the future as something which is open to the world 
let us free ourselves -- especially in the west -- from thinking about that part of the world based on oil interest or based on interests of the illusion of stability and security 
is this a story-of-the-year a story-of-the-decade or something more 
in my opinion these people are much more wiser than not only the political elite even the intellectual elite even opposition leaders including political parties 
thank you so much 
and i'm going to have michael manring play bass with me 
she got mad i took a licking 
hey hey hey hey hey hey black-eyed susie hey 
one more time now 
i fell in love with that 
the old jack tales that he had learned -- he talked like this you could hardly understand him but it was really wonderful 
it was hard on the cats but it made a great little instrument 
and if you don't know what you're doing your hands are bleeding in no time 
good news chariot's coming 
and i don't want it to leave me behind 
now my mother hoped that we learned from that the value of hard work 
no we learned something else 
the first thing i learned that day was that i never ever wanted to work that hard again 
but that day in the cotton field out there picking when those people started singing i realized i was in the very heart of real music and that's where i've wanted to be ever since 
good news chariot's coming 
it was a few years ago but i sort of remembered this story and i told it at a concert 
my mom was in the audience 
i just wanted you boys to learn the value of hard work 
and i don't want it to leave me behind 
i just break off another bottleneck and play these steel guitar blues 
they were about my age 
it had three chemicals we were really surprised to see sulfur potassium nitrate and charcoal 
we tore everything down and buried it in his backyard 
we have about 120 million dollars and we want to do it well 
the first thing that anybody who knows science and has been around science is that the stuff you learn in school as a scientific method is wrong there is no method 
i’m not going to read them all to you because i’m not in teacher mode 
and i want to talk about three stages in that evolution 
in that year we are not available for any of our clients 
we are totally closed 
quite the similar idea then a perfume packaged in a book in a die cut 
i likely already look forward to the weekend on thursdays 
europe and the us didn't really feel enticing because i knew them too well so asia it was 
so i looked for furniture 
so one of the things that we pursued in bali was pieces of furniture 
and i think by the time this lamp came about  i had finally made peace with those dogs 
i also started meditating for the first time in my life in bali 
his latest numbers are fairly impressive 
so i became my own intern 
i had fun 
financially seen over the long term it was actually successful 
we were asked to design an identity for casa da musica the rem koolhaas-built music center in porto in portugal 
it has a more transparent identity 
some of you might have seen it 
so after eight hours that's pretty much all that was left of the whole thing 
so i'll just give you my message up front try not to go extinct 
people ask me a lot -- in fact one of the most asked questions i get is why do children like dinosaurs so much 
every museum wanted a little bigger or better one than anybody else had 
so everyone was out looking for all these bigger and better dinosaurs 
and they thought about it and they even wrote papers about it where are the little dinosaurs 
first off scientists have egos and scientists like to name dinosaurs 
so this is where people went astray again 
but i have a museum and i collect dinosaurs and i can saw mine open 
and if you cut into an older dinosaur it's very massive 
so here's a dinosaur that has spikes sticking out of its head no dome and gnarly stuff on its nose 
nobody noticed the gnarly stuff sort of looked alike 
dracorex is the littlest one stygimoloch is the middle size one pachycephalosaurus is the largest one 
but it didn't give them a clue 
so we have a whole bunch of them at our museum 
and then as they grow older the horns grow forward 
if you look along the edge of the frill they have these little triangular bones that actually grow big as triangles and then they flatten against the frill pretty much like the spikes do on the pachycephalosaurs 
and we get rid of anatotitan 
so again real easy to say that tyrannosaurus ontogeny included nanotyrannus and therefore we can take out another dinosaur 
now as you can imagine this is not very popular with fourth-graders 
this is soft sell for 42nd street 
they weren't doing their primary work which was for the government while they were helping us with this 
and many musicians choose to use the theater glass walls totally open 
chamber and the notion of chamber has to do with salons and small-scale performances they asked us to bring an intimacy 
and this is a mockup that is in salt lake city that gives you a sense of what this is going to look like in full-scale 
chris has been so nice 
so nice all week he's the kind of man you could say to chris i'm really sorry i've crashed your car 
and you know that chris would say thank you 
emmanuel absolutely  
so that's going to look pretty shabby now 
so what i thought i'd do is -- in honor of emmanuel -- is what i can do is to launch today the first ted global auction 
and he'll say you're offering me things that are infinitely variable 
and she's desperate to find more evidence for the link 
this man has swum around the north pole what more evidence do you want 
no  
alright it was never exactly 'brokeback mountain'  you know i wrote to him just before i left office i said 'can i rely on your support for the next month' and he wrote back he said 'no you can't' which kind of surprised me because i'd never seen 'can't' spelled that way before 
when you think what's happened to financial services and you see what's happened to the economy you think well there is a man who delivers on his promises 
and you know iceland it was never going to cut it 
luckily somebody like george bush was really helpful 
he summed it up really at a dinner 
and then you're now well actually that's what this is about 
well you know i'm sorry about that 
and you want a leader who inspires and challenges and makes you want to be a better citizen right 
so he comes over to this country and he says we need a big fiscal stimulus 
he goes to prague he says we believe in a nuclear-free world 
do you remember that george bush a nu-ca-ler 
 who said reach out and touch  
so nelson how would you like a nice water feature 
and we need six to eight waist-high plants per person 
and it has close to 1200 such plants for 300 occupants 
our studies have found that there is a 42 percent probability of one's blood oxygen going up by one percent if one stays indoors in this building for 10 hours 
and the study showed that compared to other buildings there is a reduced incidence of eye irritation by 52 percent respiratory systems by 34 percent headaches by 24 percent lung impairment by 12 percent and asthma by nine percent 
why is this important 
so how do you feel about that -- the whole -- ma well it's pretty irritating actually because nobody ever describes what a man is wearing 
and no guy ever gets criticized but that's the least of it 
how did you handle that balance between being the tough diplomatic and strong voice of this country to the rest of the world and also how you felt about yourself as a mother a grandmother nurturing  
and so how did you handle that 
because in her lifetime -- ma that would be so 
thank you for joining us today 
my little group of molecular programmers are trying to refashion all of these parts from dna 
and if you buy all of this and you think life is about computation as i do then you look at big questions through the eyes of a computer scientist 
this is exactly analogous to the question what's the smallest program i can write that will act exactly like microsoft word 
and just as he's writing you know bacteria that will be smaller he's writing genomes that will work we could write smaller programs that would do what microsoft word does 
now these are big questions in computer science 
that holds the long strand like this 
i wanted to fold dna into something that goes up over the eye down the nose up the nose around the forehead back down and end in a little loop like this 
it's got a needle like a record needle that goes back and forth over the surface bumps up and down and feels the height of the first surface 
she wrote all her own software to design and built this dna origami a beautiful rendition of china which even has taiwan and you can see it's sort of on the world's shortest leash right 
now this is just a single switch and you need half a billion for a computer so we have a long way to go 
the dna origami is a proof that that compiler actually works 
the fact is that it does not scale 
so now we can use this counting to try and get at much bigger things than dna origami could otherwise 
you can just change a couple of the dna strands in this binary representation and you'll get 96 rather than 32 
here is a dna origami rectangle and here are some tiles growing from it 
so it turns out we actually had this idea nine years ago and that's about the time constant for how long it takes to do these kinds of things so i think we made a lot of progress 
we've got ideas about how to fix these errors 
what it's really about is taking computer science and looking at big questions in a new light asking new versions of those big questions and trying to understand how biology can make such amazing things thank you 
therefore it would be too risky to release these animals both for the released and for the natural populations 
so this is not new people have been doing this around the world 
so these genes are indeed going back to the populations 
so i say let's study more let's shed light on this issue let's do whatever we can 
this song kind of came out of all of that 
we ended up being the first medical response team in every incident location and transported 125 victims saving life 
and the other is moksha-yug access which is integrating rural supply chain on the foundations of self-help group-based microfinance 
now i come back to the idea of the new social enterprise that i'm exploring 
often it is the constraining or the back-to-the-wall situation that the hapless common man finds himself or herself in that leads him to pay a bribe 
now let me ask you another question 
but you also don't have the time resources expertise or wherewithal to fight this 
like a bribe buster service or 1-800-fight-bribes or wwwstopbribesorg or wwwpreventcorruptionorg 
i don't want to be haunted by such images any more 
a set of people actually say oh let me just grant it to them and run away from it 
but the one thing i want you to notice about them is this even though this is a very long list there isn't a single thing on it that involves other human beings 
and yet when some psychologists interviewed hospital janitors to get a sense of what they thought their jobs were like they encountered mike who told them about how he stopped mopping the floor because mr jones was out of his bed getting a little exercise trying to build up his strength walking slowly up and down the hall 
and then there was luke who washed the floor in a comatose young man's room twice because the man's father who had been keeping a vigil for six months didn't see luke do it the first time and his father was angry 
a wise person knows when and how to make the exception to every rule as the janitors knew when to ignore the job duties in the service of other objectives 
a wise person is like a jazz musician -- using the notes on the page but dancing around them inventing combinations that are appropriate for the situation and the people at hand 
a wise person knows how to use these moral skills in the service of the right aims 
dad being an academic had no idea that mike's hard lemonade contained alcohol 
and they were ready to let the kid go 
when things go wrong as of course they do we reach for two tools to try to fix them 
say 75 items in this script to teach a 25-page picture book 
scripts like these are insurance policies against disaster 
jazz musicians need some notes -- most of them need some notes on the page 
we need more rules for the bankers god knows 
some psychologists went around and polled citizens who were very well informed 
they said if we paid you six weeks' salary every year would you be willing to have a nuclear waste dump in your community 
we see this in medicine 
i don't know how many of you remember this another moral hero 15 years ago aaron feuerstein who was the head of malden mills in massachusetts -- they made polartec -- the factory burned down 
and a bonus he's discovering is he's actually going to make even more money 
in many ways this is the perfect example 
so there's a lot here at ted and at other places to celebrate 
there are ordinary heroes 
even the wisest and most well-meaning people will give up if they have to swim against the current in the organizations in which they work 
and any moral work depends upon practical wisdom 
i think there is reason for hope 
thank you 
a few years ago i was visited by the guy that runs darpa the people that fund all the advanced technologies that businesses and universities probably wouldn't take the risk of doing 
now we've got f18s and f22s and if somebody loses an arm we give them a plastic stick with a hook on it 
if it's the raisin they won't drop it 
i told them they're nuts 
it will take the other nine to make it functional and useful 
i went back and i started putting a team together the best guys i could find with a passion to do this 
we walked into walter reed and i could not have been more wrong 
i can give you fast control with low reduction ratios in these gears or i can give you power i can't give you both 
i lost my right arm but i'm a lefty 
so we went back 
so we went back and we've been working harder yet 
and he was there and they said we needed to come 
he's got no arms 
who is going to pay for it 
those are tough questions 
i don't know the answers 
what do we need to do there's very polarized answers to that question too and i don't have any answers to that 
i think eventually we'll make these things extraordinary 
and whining and complaining about what our foreign policy ought to be 
and we ought to give it to them 
that one was way more difficult than i had expected 
when the rescue workers came they resuscitated him and there was no brain damage 
so i took that as a challenge basically 
and i stayed inside of that water tank hoping my core temperature would start to drop 
so i realized that was completely not going to work 
so i went to talk to a doctor friend and i asked him how could i do that 
then i actually started thinking about liquid breathing 
you blow in and out  
and you're really ridding your body of co2 
and his total lung capacity is twice the size of an average person 
i had to drop 50 pounds in three months 
every bit of food was exactly what it was for its nutritional value 
and i started to really adapt my body 
i assumed that i could put a water tank at lincoln center and if i stayed there a week not eating i would get comfortable in that situation and i would slow my metabolism which i was sure would help me hold my breath longer than i had been able to do it 
and i thought everything seemed to be on track 
and by seven minutes i had gone into these awful convulsions 
this was a different record this was a pure o2 static apnea record that guinness had set the world record at 13 minutes 
a hypoxic tent is a tent that simulates altitude at 15000 feet 
but for tv they wanted me to be upright so they could see my face basically 
that made me extremely nervous raising the heart rate 
and there is no way to slow my heart rate down 
and i started having ischemia to the heart 
my heartbeat would go from 120 to 50 to 150 to 40 to 20 to 150 again 
so i let my feet out and i started floating to the top 
they had doctors with the pst you know so sitting there waiting 
as a magician i try to show things to people that seem impossible 
and then he stopped walking in front of him was her 
sure she had aged a little 
gusty entered her boldly and made love to her rhythmically while she filmed him because she was a keen amateur pornographer 
and that provides the ground for a type of action because consensus of each moment allows us to act 
we have three critical terms economy civil society and the state 
we propose 10 
the least important form of capital in this project is financial capital -- money 
now the issue that should concern us here -- and that's the challenge that i would like to pose to this group -- is again it takes 16 years in your countries to produce somebody with a bs degree 
every conceivable form of infrastructure had broken down 
so when violence erupts in a country like afghanistan it's because of that legacy 
look there's a very little known fact countries that have a legal average income per capita of 1000 dollars don't produce drugs 
cotton does not compete with opium a t-shirt does 
i'm all for it after all i raised a lot of it 
and then i'll let you in on a secret which is why i am an incurable optimist 
well it's been calculated a few degrees' rise in the earth's temperature would melt the polar ice caps 
and the trends for those who are at the periphery of our society who are the poorest and the most vulnerable the trends give rise to a great case for pessimism 
it will cause rising seas it will cause saline deposited into wells and into lands 
for some it will lead to anger religious and sectarian violence and terrorism 
a minimum of 20 to 30 inches of increase in sea levels is the best case that we can hope for and it could be 10 times that 
enough of the bad news human beings have always risen to the challenge 
20 years ago there were three and a half million 
this disease is called sudden wealth syndrome  
all throughout the technology world we're seeing young people bitten by this disease of sudden wealth syndrome 
more reasons to be optimistic in the '60s and i am a creature of the '60s there was a movement 
and on july 7th around the world i learned only yesterday there will be global live earth concerts 
now that doesn't mean that people understand that global warming hurts the poorest and the weakest the most 
we visited every house in india searching for smallpox -- 120 million houses once every month for nearly two years 
thank you very much 
in the history of our planet there have been three great waves of evolution 
but we had to do it the hard way in the old days by choosing offspring that looked a particular way and then breeding them 
the scientists that made this cute little creature ended up slaughtering it and eating it afterwards 
a cama is a camel-llama hybrid created to try to get the hardiness of a camel with some of the personality traits of a llama 
they did it with puppies 
and so some states have decided to allow them some states have decided to ban them 
and before you get too worried about it here in the united states the majority of food you buy in the supermarket already has genetically-modified components to it 
this is prometea the first cloned horse 
these were the first cloned calves the first cloned grey wolves and then finally the first cloned piglets alexis chista carrel janie and dotcom 
this is the use of animals now to create drugs and other things in their bodies that we want to create 
these are two creatures that were created in order to save endangered species 
and now using a joystick they can send this creature around the lab and control whether it goes left or right forwards or backwards 
we've taken away the autonomy of this animal 
and he used that as the it piece of a mechanism which ran a flight simulator 
i don't know but in fact it is a fully living brain that we have managed to keep alive to do our bidding 
this is a mouse created by charles vacanti of the university of massachusetts 
this is what frankenstein's lab looks like 
we are not only already using these things in animals some of them we're already beginning to use on our own bodies 
he was raised by very supportive and interested parents 
and the observations that he made on that epic journey were to be eventually distilled into his wonderful book on the origin of species published 150 years ago 
now what is so interesting and to some the extent what's a bit infamous about the origin of species is that there is only one line in it about human evolution 
if only darwin had nasa 
this has tremendous implications for our understanding of the evolution of human skin pigmentation 
and that skin pigmentation itself was a product of evolution 
so living at the equator we got lots and lots of ultraviolet radiation and the melanin -- this wonderful complex ancient polymer compound in our skin -- served as a superb natural sunscreen 
major moves outside of our equatorial homeland from africa into other parts of the old world and most recently into the new world 
but it's all uva and significantly that uva has no ability to make vitamin d in your skin 
humans have been on the move for a long time 
here are just some of the biggest movements of people voluntary movements in the last 5000 years 
and not all these moves were voluntary 
evolution helps us 
but we need to think about how he compares in terms of his pigmentation to other people on earth 
they also run the risk of vitamin d deficiency if they have desk jobs like that guy 
darwin i think would have appreciated this even though he eschewed the importance of climate on the evolution of pigmentation during his own life 
well the topic i'm going to discuss is one which is in a certain sense very peculiar because it's very old 
now why do i show a cauliflower a very ordinary and ancient vegetable 
if you try to weigh it -- of course it's very easy to weigh it and when you eat it the weight matters -- but suppose you try to measure its surface 
if you cut with a sharp knife one of the florets of a cauliflower and look at it separately you think of a whole cauliflower but smaller 
now what did humanity do with that 
well surprisingly enough it's good in many ways 
it used to be very time-consuming but now it's nothing 
anatomists were arguing very much about that 
this cloud is completely 100 percent artificial 
and the only part which is natural is a number the roughness of the cloud which is taken from nature 
mathematicians got into self-praise to an extent which was absolutely amazing that man can invent things that nature did not know 
in particular it could invent things like a curve which fills the plane 
i read the book that mr eiffel wrote about his tower and indeed it was astonishing how much he understood 
then i was telling my assistant i don't see anything can you paint it 
it was very easy and you can write many books very fast about it 
in a way it's the story of my life 
if you could find something new anything you will get your career made 
it's so complicated 
obviously from extraterrestrials 
thank you very much 
in 1984 in what can only be considered one of the greatest crimes of humanity nearly one million people died of starvation in my country of birth ethiopia 
not because there was not enough food -- because there was actually a surplus of food in the fertile regions of the south parts of the country -- but because in the north people could not access or entitle themselves to that food 
most africans today by far are farmers 
it also has very high cost implications 
speaking of risk we have seen that price volatility of food crops in africa is the highest in the world 
in the american midwest farmers used to load grain onto barges and send it upriver to the chicago market 
what's really important is that the ecx will operate a market information system to disseminate prices in real time to farmers around the country using vsat technology to bring an electronic price dissemination directly to farmers 
and they come to the market knowing what grades their products will achieve in terms of a price premium 
we believe that the winds of change are here and that we can do it 
we believe that the stakes are high but that the returns will be even greater 
ethiopia's agricultural market is 30 percent higher than south africa's grain production and in fact ethiopia is the second largest maize producer in africa 
it's a bit funny to be at a conference dedicated to things not seen and present my proposal to build a 6000-kilometer-long wall across the entire african continent 
the threat is desertification 
it is always the same never the same endlessly fascinating 
one billion grains of sand come into existence in the world each second 
just south of the sahara we find the sahel 
now there is an alternative to just planting trees and hoping that they won't get chopped down 
inside of the dunes we find shade 
here i am playing the part of the mad scientist working with the bugs at ucl in london trying to solidify them 
well i was inspired for my architectural form by tafoni which look a little bit like this this is a model representation of it 
these are cavernous rock structures that i found on the site in sokoto 
that's not true at all 
so there it is -- architectural anti-desertification structures made from the desert itself 
my design as it takes you down the rabbit hole is fraught with many challenges and difficulties in the real world 
our goal is a repository of published designs so clear so complete that a single burned dvd is effectively a civilization starter kit 
he was talking about the space aliens 
i have never built an atomic pile 
think about it 
i was pretty good at the video games i was not very good at the other part so i stayed alone with the cosmos 
now you could describe this as a simple misunderstanding -- a strange encounter among humans 
i went with my friend tim mcgonigal who sat on my left 
i remember she had some sort of injury to her ankle an ace bandage and she had crutches 
i was starting high school at the time i would say she was a junior but i had never seen her before she didn't go to my school 
i mean i liked him a lot better than the sandworms 
except for the girl 
and the way i remember it the movie featured these details 
but i was exhausted and dog-bitten and so i said no 
i realized that the day would only have two possible outcomes either catherine would come back to the hotel or she would never come back to the hotel 
but he did not seem so very sure for he sat down to wait with me 
i mean somebody pays you to go around and travel and look at some of the most beautiful places on the planet 
we know that hurricanes have always happened in the past 
we hear a lot about the collapse of cod 
it's a little hard to understand that because you can go to a costco in the united states and buy cheap fish 
the trophy fish were so big that you couldn't put any of those small fish up on it 
and people paid less in 1950 dollars to catch that than what people pay now to catch those little tiny fish 
you can see the rows in the bottom the way you can see the rows in a field that has just been plowed to plant corn 
it was when i was on holiday last early autumn in france 
this is from the coast of brittany which is being enveloped in this green algal slime 
the governments of the world are taking this really seriously 
the consequence of that is that all those nutrients that fuel the great anchoveta fisheries of the sardines of california or in peru or whatever those slow down and those fisheries collapse 
now i haven't got anything against efficiency 
in the world i describe to you we have to be right over here at the right-hand side at six grams of carbon 
so i want to just spend a couple of minutes on system dynamics 
so it looks a little bit like this 
that's called the circular flow of the economy 
they want to hunker down they want to look to the future 
are we these novelty-seeking hedonistic selfish individuals 
it is about allowing ourselves the freedom to become fully human recognizing the depth and the breadth of the human psyche and building institutions to protect rembrandt's fragile altruist within 
and we're going to do it 
we're just going to click on naturejobsuk 
and this too requires investment investment -- for example in places -- places where we can connect places where we can participate shared spaces concert halls gardens public parks libraries museums quiet centers places of joy and celebration places of tranquility and contemplation sites for the cultivation of a common citizenship in michael sandel's lovely phrase 
chris anderson while they're taking the podium away just a quick question 
you're making news out of the things that tell you that we're flourishing 
but it has to have political leadership 
the napalm is burning there quite nicely 
oil doesn't sink it floats 
and the other thing it does is it spreads out the moment it hits the water 
it triples the amount of oily messy goo that you have in the water and it makes it very hard to handle 
when the chemistry of the oil and water also hits our politics it's absolutely explosive 
they have a eureka moment when we suddenly understand oil in a different context 
you might notice that many gas pumps including this one are designed to look like atms 
early journalists looked at these spills and they said this is a filthy industry 
and the thing about john d is that he went into this chaotic wild-east of oil industry and he rationalized it into a vertically integrated company a multinational 
and then there's this guy okay 
so the thing about water oil spills is that they are very politically galvanizing 
they really influence people 
everything that we are really stemmed from this period 
one of the things that happened with the two previous oil spills was that we really worked on some of the symptoms 
and these guys i mean if they were in the us they might be actually here in this room 
and then the guy in the exxon uniform stepped out and we realized it was okay 
so what i'm going to talk to you about now is what do we have to do this time 
we need to kind of get down and do the gritty work of reducing our dependence upon this fuel and these molecules 
cynthia schneider these programs are reaching incredibly deeply into society 
people become so engaged that they have volunteers just like political volunteers anyway who fan out over the countryside campaigning for their candidate 
one of them lima sahar is a pashtun from kandahar a very conservative part of the country 
it turns out that competition and winning is a universal human value 
and then a thought came across my mind if things go pear-shaped on this swim how long will it take for my frozen body to sink the four and a half kilometers to the bottom of the ocean 
nearly two billion people -- so one in three people on this earth -- rely on the water from the himalayas 
i carried on for another five or six strokes and then i had nothing in my body and i went down to the bottom of the lake 
it is the most frightening and panicky feeling that you can have 
and there we sat down and we did a debrief about what had gone wrong there on mt everest 
take some time to rest and think about things 
i say i do hardware because it sort of conveniently encompasses everything i do 
so this talk is going to be about how do we make things and what are the new ways that we're going to make things in the future 
and i was laughing about this with the very smart colleagues i have and said you know well if i have to talk about the future what is it 
literally think of proteins as subroutines that you can string together to execute a program 
and this is being built by a group of students at zurich for a design competition in biology 
took me six years at mit and about that many pages to describe what i was doing and it took him one page and so this is our muse tucker 
and the ribosome here is another little computer that helps in the translation of the proteins 
these are little mechanical computers 
these are five-state state machines 
in a neutral state they won't bind at all 
so now i'm going to show you the hands-free autonomous self-replication 
so neil gershenfeld showed you this video on wednesday i believe but i'll show you again 
and how do we think about materials and structure sort of as an information and computation problem 
this is a machine where you literally define a boundary condition 
we will be an overwhelmingly urban species 
and the correlation of course is that denser places tend to have lower emissions -- which isn't really all that difficult to figure out if you think about it 
and we're basically using mobility to get the access we need 
and it is possible of course to increase the density of the communities around us 
do they even take the very waste matter that we have from food and fiber and so forth and turn it back into soil and sequester carbon -- take carbon out of the air in the process of using our cities 
because right now our economy by and large operates as paul hawken said by stealing the future selling it in the present and calling it gdp 
president clinton if you're here thank you 
well why has violence declined no one really knows but i have read four explanations all of which i think have some grain of plausibility the first is maybe thomas hobbes got it right he was the one who said that life in a state of nature was solitary poor nasty brutish and short not because he argued humans have some primordial thirst for blood or aggressive instinct or territorial imperative but because of the logic of anarchy in a state of anarchy there's a constant temptation to invade your neighbors preemptively before they invade you more recently thomas schelling gives the analogy of a homeowner who hears a rustling in the basement being a good american he has a pistol in the nightstand pulls out his gun and walks down the stairs 
it removes the need for a hair trigger for retaliation to make your deterrent threat credible and therefore it would lead to a state of peace eisner -- the man who plotted the homicide rates that you failed to see in the earlier slide -- argued that the timing of the decline of homicide in europe coincided with the rise of centralized states 
this was an argument from the political scientist james payne 
because we have been doing something right and it sure would be good to find out what it is 
we learned it in college 
we have liberia we have congo 
income per person i can put that here 
that's why we are so scared about flu isn't it 
and especially it's interesting to see china and the united states during 200 years because i have my oldest son now working for google after google acquired this software 
mao tse-tung eventually brought health to china and then he died and then deng xiaoping started this amazing move forward 
and i come now into projections but i have to stop at the door of lehman brothers there you know because --  that's where the projections are not valid any longer 
east europe latin america and oecd countries 
it's lincoln here advancing them 
and we have countries all this way 
and what has happened in the world 
we used to boast about fast social progress 
that's where we were 1900 
and you can see it's not that easy that it is war which caused this 
and here in zambia there is peace 
if i split tanzania in its income the richer 20 percent in tanzania has more hiv than the poorest one 
and it's really different within each country 
it's similar to the pellagra epidemic in mississippi in the '30s 
we have seen it here in mozambique 
that used to be the illegal diamond trade from the unita-dominated area in angola 
don't get confused of the progress of the emerging economies and the great capacity of people in the middle income countries and in peaceful low income countries 
i am a reformed marketer and i now work in international development 
he said there's just not in demand 
and as a marketer i found that curious 
and it turns out that there are three main messages used by the donor agencies for these condoms fear financing and fidelity 
they package it with the red ribbon that reminds us of hiv put it in boxes that remind you who paid for them show pictures of your wife or husband and tell you to protect them or to act prudently 
and so the lesson is this it doesn't really matter what you're selling you just have to think about who is your customer and what are the messages that are going to get them to change their behavior 
it was before the avian flu had reached europe 
i'll see what i can do ok 
generations go by somebody says hey why don't we put it on a stick 
just absolutely delights the little ones 
point is there's obviously collaboration and organization going on beyond national bounds 
a lot of forms of non-zero-sum behavior in the realm of economics and so on in everyday life often leads to cooperation 
now this sounds like an intrinsically upbeat worldview in a way because when you think of non-zero you think win-win you know that's good well there are a few reasons that actually it's not intrinsically upbeat 
i have a whole global governance sermon that i will spare you right now because i don't think that's going to be enough anyway although it's essential 
that is to say --  -- thank you thank you that is to say remember my whole view of morality is that it boils down to self-interest 
doing the best i can ok 
it was kind of along these lines and the allegation was that i have quote affection for terrorists 
and a kind of saving higher moral level something that kind of literally saves the world 
yahweh is our savior means he has saved the nation of israel which at the time was a pretty high-level social organization 
i am very very happy to be amidst some of the most -- the lights are really disturbing my eyes and they're reflecting on my glasses 
because despair civil war hunger and famine although they're part and parcel of our african reality they are not the only reality 
but they also succeed at the job of entrepreneurship 
support private investment in africa both domestic and foreign 
which country is that 
the productive margin in our governments' search for revenue does not lie in the domestic economy it lies with international donors 
the imf the world bank and the cartel of good intentions in the world has taken over our rights as citizens and therefore what our governments are doing because they depend on aid is to listen to international creditors rather than their own citizens 
they talk to international donors 
where has all the aid gone 
uganda's recurrent expenditure -- by recurrent what do i mean 
the editor of discover told us 10 of them i'm going to give you the eleventh 
so they came to me -- cnn -- and they said professor seligman would you tell us about the state of psychology today 
look doctor seligman we can see you're really not comfortable in this medium 
not good enough and that's what i'm going to be talking about 
it should be just as concerned with building strength as with repairing damage 
and starting about six years ago we asked about extremely happy people 
that's what aristotle was talking about 
the first life is the pleasant life and it's simply as best we can find it it's having as many of the pleasures as you can as much positive emotion as you can and learning the skills -- savoring mindfulness -- that amplify them that stretch them over time and space 
in two of the three great arenas of life by the time len was 30 len was enormously successful the first arena was work 
it turned out that -- len grew up in long island and he played football and watched football and played bridge -- len is in the bottom five percent of what we call positive affectivities 
when he walks onto the floor of the american exchange at 930 in the morning time stops for him and it stops till the closing bell 
and we think there's a recipe for it and it's knowing what your highest strengths are 
just one example one person i worked with was a bagger at genuardi's 
her highest strength was social intelligence so she re-crafted bagging to make the encounter with her the social highlight of every customer's day 
now obviously she failed 
what you get out of that is not smiley-ness 
i'd like you to remember someone who did something enormously important that changed your life in a good direction and who you never properly thanked 
i hope all of you have such a person 
but they were empty 
and so the parallel thing holds with technology entertainment and design i believe 
so in conclusion the eleventh reason for optimism in addition to the space elevator is that i think with technology entertainment and design we can actually increase the amount of tonnage of human happiness on the planet 
and if technology can in the next decade or two increase the pleasant life the good life and the meaningful life it will be good enough 
here's an example 
four years ago i was at the beach with my son and he was learning how to swim in this relatively soft surf of the delaware beaches 
so this represents -- this is a cross-sample of some remarkable images taken by some of the world's greatest photojournalists working at the very top of their craft -- except one 
but to be a great photojournalist you have to have more than just one or two great photographs in you 
but the centerpiece species of zakouma are the elephants 
and instead created a story that touched our audiences deeply 
instead of just knowledge of this park he created an understanding and an empathy for the elephants the rangers and the many issues surrounding human-wildlife conflicts 
he saw that this was a living and breathing and vital part of how the entire urban area functioned 
we also want to look for solutions 
jim took what could have been a straight-up medical science story and gave it a human dimension that touched our readers deeply 
but there are also times when photographers simply encounter things that are when it comes down to it just plain fun 
thank you 
and my father was a soldier and my uncle was a fisherman and also a poacher 
for three times i applied to biomedical science to be a doctor 
with the end of the dictatorship regime of mobutu sese seko that most of you know life became very very difficult 
so they started fleeing from the east to the west 
all my friends said we are leaving because we are a target 
but i'm not going to the east because i don't know swahili 
because he's pygmy he knows how to track elephants in the forest 
they came to told me i have to save him 
everywhere there has been constant extraction of mineral killing animals the logging timbers and so on 
that is coltan extraction gold mining 
we have to do it because to let our movement advance 
after a week we celebrated the birthday of that okapi they killed an elephant just 50 meters to the area where the zoo where okapi was born 
i devoted half of it to rebuild the herbarium because we didn't have good infrastructure to start plants 
but is gun industries a tool to rebuild or is it a game 
and they can't go even to university 
thank you thank you 
one of the biggest challenges in computer graphics has been being able to create a photo-real digital human face 
and one of the reasons it is so difficult is that unlike aliens and dinosaurs we look at human faces every day 
we shoot all of these photographs in about three seconds 
if we zoom in on this photograph right here we can see it's a really nice photograph to have of her because she is lit from absolutely everywhere at the same time to get a nice image of her facial texture 
we're just seeing the coarse-scale geometry here 
and thank you very much 
we're roughly two days from the entrance at that point 
otherwise it is completely dark in these places 
next year i'll be leading an international team to j2 
this is one of the places where planetary scientists believe there is a highest probability of the detection of the first life off earth in the ocean that exists below there 
it's basically a nuclear-heated torpedo 
one is how do you do science autonomy underground 
how do you take a robot and turn it into a field microbiologist 
if it passes the microscopic test we go for a collection 
no hands at the wheel 
this is all behavioral autonomy here that's being conducted by the robot on its own 
that's more than you pay for ted if google dropped their sponsorship 
there is a place where you can 
if we're going to get that and make that gas station possible we have to figure out ways to move large volumes of payload through space 
it has never been done 
i like this equipment you know and i really value it so we're not going to burn the gear 
and i'm gonna try and do that within the 18-minute time span that we were told to stay within and to follow the ted commandments that is actually something that creates a near-death experience but near-death is good for creativity 
i think that part of it also begins with a sense of identity crisis you know who am i why am i this particular person why am i not black like everybody else 
i used to draw i thought i would be an artist 
and when you are faced with the prospect of death very soon you begin to think very much about everything 
so in quantum mechanics of course you have dark energy and dark matter 
and that's what i look for in my work a personal meaning 
and they also have to make a living and people need to be fed 
it may be something that is perhaps more serious -- as i said human rights in burma 
this leads to this question 
in this case i was writing a story that included some kind of detail period of history a certain location 
especially when good things happen and in particular when bad things happen 
but i do think there's a kind of serendipity and i do want to know what those elements are so i can thank them and also try to find them in my life 
is it because i had the filter that i have such a strong coincidence in writing about these things 
it takes a while but i have to let go of them and just go there and be there 
and the reason is that until wonder came along and figured out how to spread the idea of sliced bread no one wanted it 
and when i talk about it i usually pick business because they make the best pictures that you can put in your presentation and because it's the easiest sort of way to keep score 
well this tv-industrial complex informed my entire childhood and probably yours 
and i ignored every message because i don't have a pain reliever problem 
i buy the stuff in the yellow box because i always have 
consumers don't care about you at all they just don't care 
because people saw it and said -- i didn't know that was there -- and they noticed it 
and the thing is people in the fashion business know what it's like to be in the fashion business -- they're used to it 
the rest of us have to figure out how to think that way 
how to understand that it's not about interrupting people with big full-page ads or insisting on meetings with people 
he lived in paris last year he sold 10 million dollars' worth of french bread 
it was neat it was remarkable and slowly it spread from one person to another person until finally it became the official bread of three-star restaurants in paris 
they would ignore the geeks and god forbid the laggards 
to make a product to market an idea to come up with any problem you want to solve that doesn't have a constituency with an otaku is almost impossible 
krispy kreme has a strategy and what they do is they enter a city they talk to the people with otaku and then they spread through the city to the people who've just crossed the street 
they're made from cremains 
oh you like my ring it's my grandmother 
fastest-growing business in the whole mortuary industry 
the first one is design is free when you get to scale 
and the people who come up with stuff that's remarkable more often than not figure out how to put design to work for them 
silk put a product that does not need to be in the refrigerated section next to the milk in the refrigerated section 
for the people who were there and looking at that section it was remarkable 
and i wanted to tell stories about all the amazing things i was seeing underwater incredible wildlife and interesting behaviors 
and the ice that is there is quite thin 
these are the tuna the billfish and the sharks 
but the truth is we're way too efficient at catching them and their stocks have collapsed worldwide 
so this is the true cost of a shrimp dinner maybe seven or eight shrimp and 10 pounds of other animals that had to die in the process 
i also wanted to focus on the shark fishing industry because currently on planet earth we're killing over 100 million sharks every single year 
but before i went out to photograph this component i sort of wrestled with the notion of how do you make a picture of a dead shark that will resonate with readers you know i think there's still a lot of people out there who think the only good shark is a dead shark 
one of the locations was this place called tiger beach in the northern bahamas where tiger sharks aggregate in shallow water 
i also searched on this story for the elusive great hammerhead an animal that really hadn't been photographed much until maybe about seven or 10 years ago 
but this is crucial habitat and it's where they spend the first two three years of their lives until they're big enough to go out on the rest of the reef 
i actually jumped in and photographed this and with the fisherman's permission i cut the turtle out and it was able to swim free 
but you know thousands of other leatherbacks each year are not so fortunate and the species' future is in great danger 
you can see the coal burning plant in the background 
i went down there in the winter time 
and these are animals that had never seen humans before and i was one of the first people they probably had ever seen 
for example they hoped that certain species of fish like the new zealand snapper would return because they had been fished to the brink of commercial extinction 
but when the fish came back and began predating and controlling the urchin population low and behold kelp forests emerged in shallow water 
and that's because the urchins eat kelp 
little blue cod swimming in for a dash of color 
the ocean is indeed resilient and tolerant to a point but we must be good custodians 
but i'm moving past malthus because i think that we just might be about 150 years from a kind of new enlightenment 
and the world's population expected to top out at something hopefully a bit less than 10 billion late this century 
but look what happened in europe after the plague rising wages land reform technological innovation birth of the middle class and after that forward-looking social movements like the renaissance and later the enlightenment 
because transitions are dangerous times 
fear for the future leads to some rash decisions 
i was walking in the market one day with my wife and somebody stuck a cage in my face 
so we're in east borneo this is the place where i started 
what we did was we formulated recipes -- how to go from a starting situation where you have nothing to a target situation 
and once the soil gets dried you're in a dry season -- you get cracks oxygen goes in flames come out and the problem starts all over again 
this is what it looked like for three months 
we lost all the crops no children gained weight for over a year they lost 12 iq points it was a disaster for orangutans and people 
that was why i put it as a single point up there 
you need the bacteria to fix nitrogen and without those microorganisms you won't have any performance at all 
and we have monitored every single one of those trees from space 
in the beginning maybe pineapples and beans and corn in the second phase there will be bananas and papayas later on there will be chocolate and chilies 
and that's green if you look from the tower -- this is when we start attacking the grass 
air humidity is up 10 percent 
each of the families that have sold their land now get a piece of land back 
if one member trespasses the agreement and does cut down trees the other 19 members have to decide what's going to happen to him 
in north sulawesi it is the cooperative -- they have a democratic culture there so there you can use the local justice system to protect your system 
they can now sell part of those fruits to the orangutan project 
now i think the real key to doing it to give a simple answer is integration 
there's no matter of scale it's not a question of scale it's not a question of financial resources 
and most of the people are leaving the city and living outside of the city 
he is invited for a party -- he never wants to leave 
he's a very demanding person 
parks -- old quarries that they were transformed into parks 
so in a city you have to work fast 
and we cannot have all the answers 
you see he's right 
he said there are two types of people in this world those who divide the world into two types and those who do not 
if you said to them don't do this anymore they'd wonder what you were talking about 
you have to create the circumstances where they show themselves 
it means challenging what we take for granted things that we think are obvious 
he said this in december 1862 to the second annual meeting of congress 
i ought to explain that i have no idea what was happening at the time 
so no doubt something fascinating was happening in december 1862 which the americans among us will be aware of 
you know what it means 
but our minds are still hypnotized by them and we have to disenthrall ourselves of some of them 
teenagers do not wear wristwatches 
she doesn't see the point 
it has multiple functions 
everybody who's spoken at ted has told us implicitly or sometimes explicitly a different story that life is not linear it's organic 
i don't mean you shouldn't go to college but not everybody needs to go and not everybody needs to go now 
you know to me human communities depend upon a diversity of talent not a singular conception of ability 
kids sitting in front of unimpressed panels you know with their resumes  flipping through and saying well this is it 
i was very struck by natalie merchant's songs last night recovering old poems 
it's axiomatic why not us 
they went on to describe me as america's greenest ceo 
and theft of our children's future would someday be a crime 
according to paul and anne ehrlich and a well-known environmental impact equation impact -- a bad thing -- is the product of population affluence and technology 
paul and anne ehrlich's environmental impact equation i is equal to p times a times t population affluence and technology 
and i reasoned that if we could make those transformative changes and get rid of t1 altogether we could reduce our impact to zero including our impact on the climate 
fossil fuel usage is down 60 percent per unit of production due to efficiencies in renewables 
down 40 percent in our broadloom carpet business which we acquired in 1993 right here in california city of industry where water is so precious 
we have diverted 148 million pounds -- that's 74000 tons -- of used carpet from landfills closing the loop on material flows through reverse logistics and post-consumer recycling technologies that did not exist when we started 14 years ago 
costs products people marketplaces -- what else is there 
but the marketplace was down 36 percent 
we can see our way now clear to the top of that mountain 
who is that person 
and we're all acutely aware what's it going to mean in the future when we ask someone to pay a hundred dollars for a symphony opera or ballet ticket when that cultural consumer is used to downloading on the internet 24 hours a day for 99 cents a song or for free 
the arts reformation like the religious reformation is spurred in part by technology with indeed the printing press really leading the charge on the religious reformation 
this group others have called the pro ams amateur artists doing work at a professional level 
but i want to be clear just as the religious reformation did not spell the end to the formal church or to the priesthood i believe that our artistic institutions will continue to have importance 
and indeed i think rather than being annihilated the performing arts are posed on the brink of a time when we will be more important than we have ever been 
i salute all of you as activists in that quest and urge you to embrace and hold dear the arts in your work whatever your purpose may be 
thank you 
manchester craftsmen's guild is named after my neighborhood 
built in a tough neighborhood where people have been given up for dead 
my view is that if you want to involve yourself in the life of people who have been given up on you have to look like the solution and not the problem 
and now that i'm giving speeches at conferences like ted i got put on the board of the carnegie museum 
well i think that welfare mothers and at-risk kids and ex-steel workers deserve a fountain in their life 
and he called me into his office -- which is the equivalent of going to see the wizard of oz  -- and john heinz had 600 million dollars and at the time i had about 60 cents 
so at my school we subsidize a gourmet lunch program for welfare mothers in the middle of the inner city because we've discovered that it's good for their stomachs but it's better for their heads 
i've actually eaten seven of those baskets and they're very good 
remember i'm the black kid from the '60s who got his life saved with ceramics 
let me show you what these people do 
we have a world class gallery because we believe that poor kids need a world class gallery so i designed this thing 
so he jumped in the van he went to miss jones' house and said miss jones i knew you wanted to come to your kid's art opening but you probably didn't have a ride 
and there is no statistical difference between the white parents and the black parents 
she said well i work for a company called hewlett-packard 
and i said well there's an easy solution to that problem 
he said because i heard you built the center and i didn't believe that you did it and i wanted to see for myself 
well we did win and our name was literally in lights over madison square garden 
and that was our first recording studio which was the broom closet 
and this is what i want to do when i grow up 
this is in a place called san francisco 
and i said herbie this is my concept of a training center for poor people 
and now i really want to build one 
and i promised these people that i was going to build this thing and we're going to build it all right 
and i said if i can follow that music i'll get out into the sunlight and i'll be ok 
and i don't think i'm crazy 
so 10 times more bacterial cells than human cells on a human being 
at the best you're 10 percent human but more likely about one percent human depending on which of these metrics you like 
and so we wanted to think if there couldn't be a different way that bacteria live 
what you're looking at on this slide is just a person from my lab holding a flask of a liquid culture of a bacterium a harmless beautiful bacterium that comes from the ocean named vibrio fischeri 
we just took the picture by turning the lights off in the room and this is what we see 
but when they grew to a certain cell number all the bacteria turned on light simultaneously 
the question that we had is how can bacteria these primitive organisms tell the difference from times when they're alone and times when they're in a community and then all do something together 
this is like the stealth bomber of the ocean 
and then as the cells grow they're all releasing that molecule into the environment so there's lots of molecule there 
but the one that's probably the most important to you is virulence 
this is the vibrio fischeri molecule 
so then we started to look at other bacteria and these are just a smattering of the molecules that we've discovered 
the left-hand part of the molecule is identical in every single species of bacteria 
what that does is to confer exquisite species specificities to these languages 
each molecule fits into its partner receptor and no other 
each bacteria uses a particular molecule that's its language that allows it to count its own siblings 
anywhere on your body it looks pretty much like this and what i hope you can see is that there's all kinds of bacteria there 
couldn't these be new kinds of antibiotics 
and so now of course we have this global problem in infectious diseases 
the first one is we've targeted the intraspecies communication system 
i hope that what you've learned is that bacteria can distinguish self from other 
this is exactly what happens in your body 
but then to finish with a plug for all the good and miraculous bacteria that live on the earth we've also made pro-quorum sensing molecules 
remember you have these 10 times or more bacterial cells in you or on you keeping you healthy 
so i'm really a basic scientist not a clinician but in the last year and a half i've started to switch over to use what we've been learning about these patterns of activity to develop prosthetic devices and what i wanted to do today is show you an example of this 
it's really our first foray into this 
like this pattern of pulses here actually means baby's face and so when the brain gets this pattern of pulses it knows that what was out there was a baby's face and if it got a different pattern it would know that what was out there was say a dog or another pattern would be a house 
so this is what we've been working on and this is what our prosthetic does 
so a completely blind retina even one with no front-end circuitry at all no photoreceptors can now send out normal signals signals that the brain can understand 
and so with the standard method the cells do fire they just don't fire in the normal firing patterns because they don't have the right code 
this is just actually the first one that we tried 
so it's different from the motor prosthetics where you're communicating from the brain to a device here we have to communicate from the outside world into the brain and be understood and be understood by the brain 
you can just call it out 
who else 
the worst flute players 
actually that was aristotle's answer too 
peter the greatest benefit to all 
the greatest benefit to all 
all right 
aristotle had a different reason for saying the best flutes should go to the best flute players 
and the point the essential nature of musical performance is to produce excellent music 
suppose you were on the supreme court 
suppose you were deciding the justice of this case 
raise your hand and we'll try to get you a microphone 
that's part of the game of golf  
charlie what do you say to warren 
warren i am not a golfer 
he wouldn't have granted the cart and he had a very interesting dissent 
but since it is the very nature of a game to have no object except amusement  that is what distinguishes games from productive activity  it is quite impossible to say that any of a game's arbitrary rules is essential 
first no real sports fan would talk that way 
on the face of it it seemed to be -- this debate about the golf cart -- an argument about fairness what's an unfair advantage 
so if golfing is the kind of game that can be played while riding around in a golf cart it would be hard to confer on the golfing greats the status that we confer the honor and recognition that goes to truly great athletes 
how many here favor the first policy the state should recognize traditional marriage only 
i'm going to talk about why we have to get our shit together and actually talk about this a bit more than we do 
that was easy ok 
ok hands up anyone in the audience who's not sure whether malaria is a good thing or a bad thing 
you know a lot of people said well you know city boys have no business telling us rural types what to do with our time 
it's a global trance 
but the question is are they so dangerous -- these risks of doing something about aging -- that they outweigh the downside of doing the opposite namely leaving aging as it is 
people worry about overpopulation they say well if we fix aging no one's going to die to speak of or at least the death toll is going to be much lower only from crossing st giles carelessly 
this pro-aging trance is what stops us from agitating about these things 
but it isn't 
so these trajectories here are basically how we would expect people to live in terms of remaining life expectancy as measured by their health for given ages that they were at the time that these therapies arrive 
but if you're only 50 then there's a chance that you might be able to pull out of the dive and you know --  -- eventually get through this and start becoming biologically younger in a meaningful sense in terms of your youthfulness both physical and mental and in terms of your risk of death from age-related causes 
and of course if you're a bit younger than that then you're never really even going to get near to being fragile enough to die of age-related causes 
and that's quite a thought 
so in other words we add two years -- we treble their remaining lifespan starting from the point that we started the therapies 
so we're likely to end up with a very strong change in people's attitudes and of course that has enormous implications 
because the critical thing about this is that even though the damage only eventually causes pathology the damage itself is caused ongoing-ly throughout life starting before we're born 
and the reason it's a losing battle is because the damage is continuing to accumulate 
so these seven things were all under discussion in gerontology a long time ago and that is pretty good news because it means that you know we've come a long way in biology in these 20 years so the fact that we haven't extended this list is a pretty good indication that there's no extension to be done 
and you know what happened 
but i mean look -- how long does it take to spend that on the war in iraq 
and i think we know how to do it and i'll stop there 
audience species on this planet have evolved with immune systems to fight off all the diseases so that individuals live long enough to procreate 
if i project that that would make me think that i would live until 120 if i don't crash on my motorbike 
ninety-nine pence was the starting price and no reserve 
then there was the volcano that interrupted the travel plans of almost all of you and many of your friends including president obama 
i'm here to tell you the story of audur capital which is a financial firm founded by me and kristin -- who you see in the picture -- in the spring of 2007 just over a year before the economic collapse hit 
and we believe that doing emotional due diligence is just as important as doing financial due diligence 
so we like to see profits plus positive social and environmental benefits when we invest 
now that we've had all that happen and we have all this data out there telling us that it's much better to have diversity around the decision-making tables will we see business and finance change 
i want to see more revolutionary thinking and i remain hopeful 
for me it was the start of a long journey but i decided that day to matter 
external debt -- something that i can tell you a long story about because i personally worked on one of the biggest debts on the continent -- has come down dramatically 
because we are confronted with a challenge 
we need to bring it back to say what is the combination of all these factors that is going to yield what we want  
and i want to tell you something 
the issue is not that 
she was three years old and i was 15 
now i put my sister on my back -- burning -- and i walked 10 kilometers with her strapped on my back 
in about two to three hours she started to move 
you know we have to use it well 
for which many people even from other parts of the world are going there to find jobs 
they are just discovering 
let's sit down and really tell you where the money should be channeled and where this aid should go 
how can we get government to combine properly with these private foundations with the international organizations and with our private sector 
aid cannot solve our problems i'm firmly convinced about that 
in fact the chinese minister of finance said to me when i asked him what are we doing wrong in nigeria 
infrastructure infrastructure infrastructure and discipline 
and i repeat it for the continent 
and lastly what are you going to do to be part of this partnership of aid government private sector and the african as an individual 
i will say though that after having done surgery a lot it's somewhat similar to playing a musical instrument 
and i'll tell you that most scientific studies of music they're very dense and when you actually go through them it's very hard to recognize the music in it 
that blood flow causes an increase in local blood to that area with a deoxyhemoglobin change in concentration 
charles limb this is a plastic midi piano keyboard that we use for the jazz experiments 
and so what we did was we brought professional jazz players to the nih and we had them memorize this piece of music on the left the lower-left -- which is what you heard me playing -- and then we had them improvise to the same exact chord changes 
and i've listened to that solo 200 times and i still like it 
and so we had this focal area called the medial prefrontal cortex that went way up in activity 
we had this broad patch of area called the lateral prefrontal cortex that went way down in activity and i'll summarize that for you here 
now these are multifunctional areas of the brain 
the fact that we do it over and over again lets you acclimate to your surroundings 
so how do you study rap scientifically 
with this big screen you can all rap with me okay 
he's just memorized a rhyme for us 
and what we see we do see language areas lighting up but then -- eyes closed -- when you are free-styling versus memorizing you've got major visual areas lighting up 
you have heightened brain activity when you're doing a comparable task when that one task is creative and the other task is memorized 
i mean don't get me wrong calculus is an important subject 
and every student who studies math science engineering economics they should definitely learn calculus by the end of their freshman year of college 
it's understanding data 
look the world has changed from analog to digital 
the majority of our functional brain is distributed over the outer surface layer of the brain and to increase the area that's available for mental capacity the brain surface is highly folded 
our breakthrough was to create an algorithm that unfolds the cortex so that we can map the signals closer to its source and therefore making it capable of working across a mass population 
the second challenge is the actual device for observing brainwaves 
with neutral there's nothing in particular that evan needs to do 
it takes eight seconds to do this and now that that's done we can choose a movement-based action 
so evan choose something that you can visualize clearly in your mind 
so the idea here now is that evan needs to imagine the object coming forward into the screen and there's a progress bar that will scroll across the screen while he's doing that 
the first time nothing will happen because the system has no idea how he thinks about pull 
so one two three go 
okay 
ah good job 
that's really amazing 
so what you want to do -- at least with movement-based actions we do that all the time so you can visualize it 
so i'd like to show you a few examples because there are many possible applications for this new interface 
and bed nets have an effect on the epidemic but you're never going to make it extinct with bed nets 
we could spend hours going over this 
it creates a very high peak power and it lets you do all kinds of interesting things in particular it lets you find hemozoin 
and using both this technique and other optical techniques we think we can make those diagnostics 
we also have another hemozoin-oriented therapy for malaria a way in acute cases to actually take the malaria parasite and filter it out of the blood system 
you can give drug administration 
we have all of the precipitation data and the temperature data 
that's very important because the humidity and precipitation tell you whether you've got standing pools of water for the mosquitoes to breed 
so that sets the stage on which you do this 
now one of the ways you can make them not fly is with ddt 
in 1935 there were 150000 cases a year of malaria in the united states but ddt and a massive public health effort managed to squelch it 
audience yeah 
nathan myhrvold okay so our legal department prepared a disclaimer and here it is 
now after thinking about this a little bit we thought you know it probably would be simpler to do this with a nonlethal laser 
we have the device over here 
now that's a fairly straightforward image processing routine and let me show you how it works 
this is very satisfying 
it grows and is nurtured 
basically a restaurant just like any other 
chairs recycled and recyclable 
i was experimenting with these -- i don't know if you can see it -- but there's a work surface there 
this is the kitchen which is in the same room 
rather than me putting a dish down they were allowed to help themselves to as much or as little as they wanted 
this is the waste room 
in here i have produce and boxes that are unavoidable 
i'm taking the temperature of the canal outside pumping it through the heat exchange mechanism it's turning through these amazing sails on the roof and that in turn is falling softly onto the people in the restaurant cooling them or heating them as the need may be 
in the canal which is just outside the restaurant there is hundreds of meters of coil piping 
he's growing all his own fruit and that's fantastic 
so you've got to watch your space for that 
okay so this is my next project 
i mean the whole thing is is super-sustainable 
and no one's doing that just yet 
this is a herd and it is built according to genetical codes 
in fact it's a new invention of the wheel 
in fact this is better than a wheel because when you try to drive with your bicycle on the beach you will notice it's very hard to do 
ok good 
so as soon it has been to the sea it changes the pattern of zeroes and ones here and it knows always where it is on the beach so it's very simple brain 
so it's a sort of imagination of the simple world of the beach animal 
we did haemophilus influenzae and then the smallest genome of a self-replicating organism that of mycoplasma genitalium 
in 2003 we published our first success 
so ham smith and clyde hutchison developed some new methods for making error-free dna at a small level 
and we can walk through the reasons for that but basically the small cell took on the order of one to two months to get results from whereas the larger faster-growing cell takes only two days 
it's an amazing step forward but we had a problem because now we had the bacterial chromosomes growing in yeast 
and we thought this would be a great test bed for learning how to get chromosomes out of yeast and transplant them 
we narrowed it down to one fragment we sequenced it and found just one base pair had been deleted in an essential gene 
we got a text from dan saying that now the first blue colonies existed 
so early on we developed the notion of putting in watermarks in the dna to absolutely make clear that the dna was synthetic 
it's significant to us 
so when you see how long it took to get an h1n1 vaccine out we think we can shorten that process quite substantially 
you may have heard about the koran's idea of paradise being 72 virgins and i promise i will come back to those virgins 
it's just 29 words in arabic but anywhere from 65 to 72 in translation 
but all is not lost in translation 
and that number 72 never appears 
there are no 72 virgins in the koran 
they all live in colonies consisting of one or a few queens and then all the ants you see walking around are sterile female workers 
here's my study site this is really a picture of ants and the rabbit just happens to be there 
ants never make more ants colonies make more colonies 
and this shows a recently virgin queen here's her wings 
she lays eggs she feeds the larvae -- so an ant starts as an egg then it's a larva 
so things happen to an ant colony 
when it rains in the summer it floods in the desert 
and that's the process that i call task allocation 
that is that there are chambers inside they line the walls of the chambers with moist soil and it dries to a kind of an adobe-like surface in it 
and finally the midden workers put some kind of territorial chemical in the garbage 
so an ant starts out somewhere near the queen 
the queen's in there somewhere she just lays eggs 
so just to reinforce that what you might have thought about ant queens isn't true -- you know even if the queen did have the intelligence to send chemical messages through this whole network of chambers to tell the ants outside what to do there is no way that such messages could make it in time to see the shifts in the allocation of workers that we actually see outside the nest 
we started out with model airplane paint and then we found these wonderful little japanese markers and they work really well 
and so just to summarize the result well it turns out that yes the different tasks are interdependent 
and the second result which was surprising to a lot of people was that ants actually switch tasks 
the same ant doesn't do the same task over and over its whole life 
this process changes with colony age and it changes like this 
instead something about the organization must be changing as the colony gets older 
and what we're learning is that an ant uses the pattern of its antennal contacts the rate at which it meets ants of other tasks in deciding what to do 
and we've just recently demonstrated this by putting extract of hydrocarbons on little glass beads and dropping the beads gently down into the nest entrance at the right rate 
so i want now to show you a bit of film -- and this will start out first of all showing you the nest entrance 
this is taken through a fiber optics microscope it's down inside the nest 
each ant then as it comes back in is contacting other ants 
so what's interesting about this system is that it's messy 
again i don't want to say that this kind of haphazard pattern of interactions produces a factory that works with the precision and efficiency of clockwork 
that we can take the whole idea that gave birth to the internet and bring it down to the physical world in this internet zero this internet of devices 
unlike this screen where the dots are placed carefully this is a raw material 
this was just a proof of principle he did of tiles that interact magnetically where you write a code much like protein folding that specifies their structure 
but i had a problem once i had all these machines i was spending too much time teaching students to use them 
when a user screams into scream buddy their scream is silenced 
but you don't use it for inventory and payroll dec is now twice bankrupt you don't need personal fabrication in the home to buy what you can buy because you can buy it 
and the way you close it is not it for the masses but it development for the masses 
you can see it in their face just this joy of i can do it 
we designed a network sensor and kids would show up and refuse to leave the lab 
this is late at you know 11 o'clock at night and i think i was the only person surprised when what she built worked the first time 
and again that was just for the joy of it 
and then in turn businesses started to grow like making these antennas 
we're learning more from them than we're giving them 
i was showing my kids in a fab lab how to use it 
real invention is happening in these labs 
pdps came between mainframes and minicomputers 
it was there because they wanted to find animals in the mountains but it outgrew it so they built this extraordinary village for the lab 
if this room full of heroes is just clever enough you can solve the problems 
the message coming from the fab labs is that the other five billion people on the planet aren't just technical sinks they're sources 
that has got to be stopped 
somehow that doesn't seem right 
so here we are using 20 million barrels a day -- producing eight importing 12 and from the 12 five comes from opec 
now i had people in washington last week told me he said the saudis can produce the oil for five dollars a barrel 
we're headed to natural gas 
run it through the separator and you're ready to use it 
natural gas will fit all of those 
it will replace or be able to be used for that 
so i have tried to target on where we use the natural gas 
and where i've targeted is on the heavy-duty trucks 
there are eight million of them 
i'm back to theorist again 
so there's nothing going on that impresses me in washington on that plan other than i'm trying to focus on that eight million 18-wheelers 
thank you 
that'll make you abandon something 
i'm a geologist got out of school in '51 and i've been in the industry my entire life 
i'm not a big natural gas producer 
you've made the money you need 
does that make sense 
the government is not successful on these things 
but chris i think where we're headed the long-term i don't mind going back to nuclear 
there isn't anything wrong with nuke 
tbp fracking what is fracking 
i mean seriously the department of energy did not have anything to do with fracking 
the first frack job was in '47 
there's no problems 
if someone comes to you with a plan that really looks like it might be part of this solution are you ready to invest in those technologies even if they aren't maximized for profits they might be maximized for the future health of the planet 
when you think about resilience and technology it's actually much easier 
the internet was also very real this is a real way for humans to communicate with each other it's a big deal 
people on the east coast in 1849 when they first started to get the news they thought ah this isn't real 
you had dotcom fever and you had gold fever 
and they wouldn't let the other half out to go look for the first half because they were afraid they wouldn't come back 
they had bad burn rate in the gold rush a very bad burn rate 
this is a commercial that was played on the super bowl in the year 2000 
 bride #1 you said you had a large selection of invitations clerk but we do 
husband #2 not for another 15 minutes announcer after all it's your special day 
ourbeginningcom life's an event announce it to the world 
so there's a much better analogy that allows you to be incredibly optimistic and that analogy is the electric industry 
this was a huge -- as you would expect -- a huge capital build out 
well it was because that heavy infrastructure had already been laid down 
they would -- each room typically had a light bulb socket at the top 
and there's a rotor there -- that this motor is spinning 
and they were really happy that the guy had a speakerphone because then they had to wait on hold for an hour to talk to somebody to give them an access code after they got there 
because you know resilience -- if you think of it in terms of the gold rush then you'd be pretty depressed right now because the last nugget of gold would be gone 
she -- but you know if you really do believe that it's the very very beginning if you believe it's the 1908 hurley washing machine then you're incredibly optimistic and i do think that that's where we are 
the golden rule is great i'm a big supporter of both 
in the beginning there was compassion and i mean not just when human beings first showed up but actually even before that 
i warned you this was not going to be very warm and fuzzy 
now there's more good news that came along later in evolution a second kind of evolutionary logic 
and so you wind up most easily extending compassion to friends and allies 
so i hope i've got your attention with this promise of good news that may save the world 
basically a zero-sum game is the kind you're used to in sports where there's a winner and a loser 
either way your fortunes add up to zero that's a zero-sum game 
now if you're playing doubles then the person on your side of the net is in a non-zero-sum relationship with you because every point is either good for both of you -- positive win-win -- or bad for both of you it's lose-lose 
the deployment of the golden rule most naturally happens along these non-zero-sum channels 
with zero-sum channels you would expect something else 
but it may and the good news is that history has naturally expanded these webs of non-zero-sumness these webs that can be these channels for compassion 
that's the story of civilization 
and also sometimes people don't recognize the non-zero-sum dynamics in the world 
i think politicians can help foster non-zero-sum relationships economic engagement is generally better than blockades and so on in this regard 
if there's one thing i can encourage everyone to do politicians religious leaders and us it would be what i call expanding the moral imagination -- that is to say your ability to put yourself in the shoes of people in very different circumstances 
once upon a time i did a book called how buildings learn 
so the design problem for today is going to be how do you house an eventual monumental clock like this so it can really tick save time beautifully for 100 centuries 
and it looked like a way to go until you start thinking about what does deep time do to a building 
this is the parthenon it's only 2450 years old and look what happened to it 
and now it's a pathetic ruin and no one even knows what it was used for 
underground in a place that's really solid 
it's right on the eastern border of nevada 
it starts with the image the image is a picture you have in your mind of the goal at the end of the journey 
the labyrinth is a concept it's like a twilight zone it's a place where it's difficult where you get disoriented maybe you get scared -- but you have to go through it if you're going to get to some kind of deep reintegration 
the hillis algorithm 10 factorial gives you that number 
something you didn't expect that caps what you did expect 
and then how about a memento number seven 
what are the elements that will most affect your ideas and decisions 
people think they're just the size of shrubs but that's not actually true 
that's interesting 
but it goes a mile-and-a-half in a straight line due east into the range into very interesting territory -- except that as you'll see when we go inside in a minute we were hoping for limestone but in there is just shale 
competent rock is rock that will hold itself up without any shoring 
you may recognize a couple of the miners there 
and alexander rose on the left there worked with a bunch of people from the national park to survey the whole mine it's a mile deep 
kurt bollacker and alexander rose designed a radically wireless station 
but there's no bears and there's no poison oak and there's basically no people because this place has been empty for a long time 
well here's a potential approach 
you need to come up the lincoln canyon 
it's a secret passage it's like something from tolkien 
and then of course the next thing i hear is i've made it to the top you can see all of creation from up here 
in fact there he is that's alexander rose 
this discovery changed everything about our sense of these cliffs and what to do with them 
so even with the slowing of the rotation of the earth and so on the clock will keep perfectly good time 
so here we're looking from the south look north 
over on the eastern side it's gentle as you can see 
and that's not snow -- that's what the white limestone looks like 
another is the experience in the mountain 
and the third is the experience from the mountain which is really dominated by the view shed of the spring valley there behind danny and if you look off to the right out there 15 miles across to the schell creek range 
this is rocky mountain junipers that have been there for thousands of years 
ok let's take one more look at the mountain itself 
and this stone takes a perfect polish 
most of the amazingness of the clock we can borrow from the amazingness of the mountain 
and often i'm driving in a taxi and i see a hole in a shirt or something that looks very interesting or pretty or functional in some way that i'd never seen happen before 
i don't know where inspiration comes from 
and i think about you know their roles and about how you have to like watch what your daughters look at 
so actually check this out 
i was dating this guy right 
i was dating this guy and it was going on for about a year right 
and i kind of try not to look back you know 
and frankly i don't really know what to call myself 
too much time on computer bridge which is you know like that's so  somehow like about ten years ago i thought that the most unboring place in the world would be like a tv studio like for a day show some kind of day talk show 
because it's all of these things that i love all kind of in one place 
hi there 
rod cutting hair 
just checking because some people want to look you know aggressively ugly 
a oh no we're just staging rod we're just staging it 
i'll tell you that i cook a lot also i love to cook 
this is what i've been doing because i think it's the most fun thing in the world 
it's got a lot of different things on it 
yeah but i can never find buttermilk ever 
chef for cream 
have you ever wondered how such a situation can be turned around 
have you ever looked at the arab uprisings and thought how could we have predicted that 
but i believe now that we're moving into a new age and that age the new york times dubbed recently as the age of behavior 
and these ideas and narratives that bump people across borders are increasingly beginning to affect the way in which people behave 
if we look at islamists if we look at the phenomenon of far-right fascists one thing they've been very good at one thing that they've actually been exceeding in is communicating across borders using technologies to organize themselves to propagate their message and to create truly global phenomena 
but having been born in essex at the age of 16 i joined an organization 
by the age of 24 i found myself convicted in prison in egypt being blacklisted from three countries in the world for attempting to overthrow their governments being subjected to torture in egyptian jails and sentenced to five years as a prisoner of conscience 
the age of behavior where ideas and narratives were increasingly defining behavior and identity and allegiances 
in certain countries mosque minarets are being banned 
and why are democracy aspirants falling behind 
so the ideas and the narratives of al-qaeda come to your mind immediately 
one of their leaders was killed in pakistan recently 
to go around saying that i believe democratic culture is the best that we've arrived at as a form of political organizing is associated with extremism 
when talking about those reasons let's break down certain preconceptions 
but without freedom of speech you can't have free and fair elections 
in the '80s and '90s when islamism started in the region it spread across the mena region as a whole 
now that's a big claim i'm going to try to back it up 
slow text-based conversations then real-time voice based conversations 
he traces the edges of the individual networks and then color codes them 
but they weren't given that choice because their own citizens beat them to the punch 
essentially to say we will do anything to placate you just please stop protesting in public 
and so the protest kept going 
and so they began to arrest the protesters 
all of that is over 
he had said in january that he would not sign a bill that granted telecom immunity for possibly warrantless spying on american persons 
it was senator obama when they created it they changed the name later 
he had to issue a reply 
and he said essentially i have considered the issue 
media the media landscape that we knew as familiar as it was as easy conceptually as it was to deal with the idea that professionals broadcast messages to amateurs is increasingly slipping away 
that's the media environment we've got 
and today after the global economic crisis there was a whole new set of rules about how the state should intervene 
the first to my mind is what i call as the ideas that have arrived 
we thought of people as a liability 
this change has contributed to the vitality and the whole economy 
and the fact that we have english is now becoming a huge strategic asset 
one is the question of education 
the third thing is again cities 
but today finally after economic reforms and economic growth i think the notion that cities are engines of economic growth cities are engines of creativity cities are engines of innovation have finally been accepted 
a lot of the indian problems are related to the ideology of caste and other things 
therefore we will fundamentally rethink the way we look at the environment the way we look at energy the way we create whole new paradigms of development 
why does what's happening 10 thousand miles away matter to all of you 
and that makes a huge difference 
when india was growing at about three 35 percent and the population was growing at two percent its per capita income was doubling every 45 years 
i've been there six times four times i did work with national geographic making tectonic plate measurements twice i went with nasa doing remote sensing devices 
that gives you an idea of just how severe things are near the summit 
there were three other expeditions on the mountain an american team a new zealand team and an imax team 
and from there we climb up to camp two which is sort of the foreground 
if you notice the summit of everest is black 
this is not good weather to climb in so the climbers are just waiting hoping that the wind's going to die down 
the summit would be in the foreground 
but what happened that year was the wind suddenly and unexpectedly picked up 
i have an oxygen hose connected here 
ok this is a view taken on the summit ridge itself 
but either way you fall for the rest of your life 
this is taken from camp three where i was 
so as the climbers came by me i sort of assessed whether or not they were in condition to continue on further down 
his wife was home in new zealand seven months pregnant with their first child and rob asked to be patched into her that was done and rob and his wife had their last conversation 
it's a tackle box filled with medical supplies 
what we did was try to warm them up as best we could put oxygen on them and try to revive them which is difficult to do at 21000 feet when the tent is freezing 
as i was taking care of these climbers we got a startling experience 
but beck wasn't dead he heard that but he was completely unable to move 
now you go to this one and you see how much more the frontal lobes are lighting up 
he's trying to get his muscles going and get out of this 
it's too cold he can't keep his metabolic fires going and you see there's no more red here his brain is quieting down 
he's thinking about what he's got to do to save himself 
he's not thinking about his family now and he's getting himself motivated 
a helicopter came in at 21000 feet and carried out the highest helicopter rescue in history 
it's our trailer because i know obviously you guys are busy many of you may not have had a chance to see it 
if we could roll 
michael moriarty's wife it's really hard for him to not have his dad 
they're shooting at me 
deborah scranton thank you 
we were one of the lucky ones to get in the class with the sony cameras and the vista software 
i mean we were there for an hour talking 
and it really highlighted something that i would like to ask you guys to think about and hopefully to help with which is i think a lot of us are very afraid to have conversations about war and about politics 
how do we open it up to really be able to have a conversation 
it was mass casualties 
this is blood 
five soldiers filmed the entire time 
they spent their entire day outside the wire trying to save iraqi lives -- the iraqis who work on the post 
and for me it's trying to bridge that disconnect 
i get -- i'm often asked you know for me what have been some of the special moments from having worked on this film 
and he looked at me and i smiled and then i saw the tears start welling up in his eyes 
so when i talk about a disconnect it's not only for maybe those people who don't know a soldier which there obviously are you know these days it's not like world war ii where there was a war front and a home front and everybody seemed involved 
do you give money to any of the charities 
do you really care 
and it was something called ecorock 
and they worked absolutely very very very hard 
that's the finished production line there 
we must change everything 
so let's first talk about focused ultrasound 
and i hold in my hand a tissue-mimicking phantom 
it is transparent made just for you 
this is a setup i put in a physics lab 
we need to reach a target inside the brain 
but you may not know that he tried to perform lobotomies in the brain noninvasively with focused ultrasound in the '50s 
and it makes you ponder why those pioneers failed 
they were missing the vision 
it is approved under an fdaide at the university of virginia in charlottesville using focused ultrasound to ablate a point in his thalamus 
we attach a transducer in this case to the brain but if it will be a different organ it will be a different transducer attached to the patient 
it's a target in the thalamus 
it doesn't do any damage but it elevates the temperature by a few degrees 
but here we can get both the anatomical imaging and the temperature maps in real time 
so once the physician verifies that the focus spot is on the target he has chosen then we move to perform a full-energy ablation like you see here 
and you have to understand what is in people's mind when they are willing to take the risk 
they drove like three hours from their farm to the hospital 
so again this is an immediate relief 
i don't see without this nation taking it as some collective will or something that is a national goal to make that happen it will not happen 
and it's not just because of regulation it's because of the amount of money needed under the current evidence-based medicine and the size of trials and so on to make it happen 
and we have better-than-surgery results in breasts 
women suffer from that disease 
in the fashion industry there's very little intellectual property protection 
it's because it's a lot harder for knock-off artists to knock off these designs because they can't knock off the logo 
now the reason for this the reason that the fashion industry doesn't have any copyright protection is because the courts decided long ago that apparel is too utilitarian to qualify for copyright protection 
now fashion designers have the broadest palette imaginable in this creative industry 
people think this is a magical thing how does it happen 
johanna blakley imagine that 
they make deals with the fast fashion giants and they come up with a way to sell their product to a whole new demographic the santee alley demographic 
very low novelty standard anybody can register anything 
that is a very difficult question to answer 
fireworks displays the rules of games the smell of perfume no 
it is more complex than this but this will do 
the problem is that digital technology has completely subverted the logic of this physically fixed expression versus idea concept 
this individual lives in the atacama desert in chile and it happens to be 3000 years old 
and i'm also trying to create a means in which to step outside our quotidian experience of time and to start to consider a deeper timescale 
i'd been traveling in japan without an agenda other than to photograph and then i heard about this tree that is 2180 years old and knew that i had to go visit it 
this is a clonal tree as well 
i spoke to the biologist who discovered this tree and he told me that that spindly growth you see there in the center is most likely a product of climate change 
does anybody know how old the oldest tortoise is -- any guesses 
and then you might have heard of this giant clam that was discovered off the coast of northern iceland that reached 405 years old 
however it died in the lab as they were determining its age 
i had the opportunity to travel around the limpopo province in south africa with an expert in baobab trees 
they contain thousands of years of their own histories within themselves and they also contain records of natural and human events 
and it actually never sheds those leaves so it also bears the distinction of having the longest leaves in the plant kingdom 
this is something called an underground forest 
the tree can easily recover 
but what's unique about it is that it's doing dna repair below freezing 
it's my hope that by going to find these organisms that i can help draw attention to their remarkable resilience and help play a part in insuring their continued longevity into the foreseeable future 
our leaders and ourselves want everything but we don't talk about the costs 
and when we would gather as fellows she would push us to think about how the elders in native american culture make decisions 
they said they would try so hard to remember the fragments of the dance hoping that others were alive and doing the same 
but we find those entrepreneurs who put people and the planet before profit 
and it's only when we honor them and celebrate them and give them status that the world will really change 
for two years he hardly made any money a tiny stipend but he apprenticed with this incredible housing developer named tasneem saddiqui 
he said long story 
we can take the easier road the more cynical road which is a road based on sometimes dreams of a past that never really was a fear of each other distancing and blame 
i had the great honor of working with the child psychologist dr robert coles who stood up for change during the civil rights movement in the united states 
my final story is about a young beautiful man named josephat byaruhanga who was another acumen fund fellow who hails from uganda a farming community 
and we placed him in a company in western kenya just 200 miles away 
and he said to me at the end of his year jacqueline it was so humbling because i thought as a farmer and as an african i would understand how to transcend culture 
robert kennedy once said that few of us have the greatness to bend history itself but each of us can work to change a small portion of events 
but we do not know his face 
i find that hard to believe 
it also has to be sufficiently detailed 
all we did was look for portraits that had the characteristics of a self-portrait and look they are very similar 
they are made in the right order 
it has stored recorded can fastly retrieve the meanings of thousands tens of thousands of objects actions and their relationships in the world 
now movement has advanced to the point where it can actually control movement simultaneously in a complex sequence in complex ways as would be required for example for playing a complicated game like soccer 
you could go out into the community in monterey and you'd have difficulty finding a boy that has this ability 
and in fact they result in a wonderful differentiation in humankind in the way that in fact no two of us are quite alike 
and we try to track the changes that occur as the new skill or ability is acquired 
from these studies we defined two great epochs of the plastic history of the brain 
and that is the period in which the brain is setting up in its initial form its basic processing machinery 
and i see the brain actually develop a processor that is specialized -- specialized for that complex array a repertoire of sounds 
he's successful in his retrieval of food with this tool every time 
we can look down in the brain of the monkey 
we've actually distorted the map by the exercise 
and each one of them changes in ways that are specific to the skill or ability 
it represents changes of hundreds of millions possibly billions of synaptic connections in your brain 
that is why you in your many skills and abilities are a unique specialist a specialist that's vastly different in your physical brain in detail than the brain of an individual 100 years ago enormously different in the details from the brain of the average individual 1000 years ago 
it's not english it's noisy english 
changing it in detail it takes about 30 hours on the average 
you can see that most of the children on the left side of the distribution are moving into the middle or the right 
this is a substantially large impact 
i'm specifically interested in things like autism and cerebral palsy these great childhood catastrophes 
but also in your future is brain aerobics 
get ready for it it's going to be a part of every life not too far in the future just like physical exercise is a part of every well organized life in the contemporary period 
of course a lot of people will ignore this advice 
and one of the stories he told me so often when i was a young boy was of the first british atomic bomb test 
what he was trying to do with me was to inspire me to protect the world and show me just how fragile the world is 
i love the place 
fresh water freezes at zero 
i remember just trying to get out of the water 
and for a swimmer you need to feel your hands because you need to be able to grab the water and pull it through with you 
we are going to actually have to take them off 
and i remember looking into the ice and there were big chunks of white ice in there and the water was completely black 
it's a very frightening very very frightening thought 
it's all a little bit frightening and emotional 
the first thing we need to do is we need to break this problem down into manageable chunks 
i've just come back from giving a series of speeches in some of the poorest townships in south africa to young children as young as 10 years old 
we need to believe in ourselves 
but the most important thing we must do is i think we must all walk to the end of our lives and turn around and ask ourselves a most fundamental question 
you take about eight or so carbon atoms about 20 hydrogen atoms you put them together in exactly the right way and you get this marvelous liquid very energy-dense and very easy to refine into a number of very useful products and fuels 
but what about oil where is it in the energy system 
and that continues into the future with the renewables that we're developing today reaching maybe 30 percent of primary energy by mid century 
i picked it up outside of marble falls texas 
and it's different than this limestone you can see that 
now millions of abalone every year make this shell 
it's the same stuff as this and the same stuff as this 
and why because the lowly abalone is able to lay down the calcium carbonate crystals in layers making this beautiful iridescent mother of pearl 
very specialized material that the abalone self-assembles millions of abalone all the time every day every year 
how the molecules are put together 
here's a piece of coal 
no wonder that most of the most important international operators in germany but also in france and the uk and scandinavia everywhere systematically bribed 
they are not as good at bribing as many of their international competitors are but they were not allowed to show their strengths because the world was eaten up by grand corruption 
in the first session -- we had three sessions over the course of two years 
they even applaud it 
the world bank has turned from saulus to paulus under wolfensohn they became i would say the strongest anti-corruption agency in the world 
they have to have a much more transparent financial governance 
and that's what it's about 
we use portraiture as a way to deliver those lives but that's it 
and i thought really what we need is an elders program to just sit at the feet of amazing people and hear them talk 
that's barbara walters and others like that and we like that 
and he had never appeared in public since that point 
and she said well something very weird was happening 
i didn't know what was going on but i was so part of the process of getting that out 
these were people through their 90s 
but after the interview i got a call very gruff voice from a woman 
never ever get up on a stage with somebody who's modest because all of these people have been assembled to listen to them and they sit there and they say aw shucks it was an accident 
the worst interview i ever did william l shirer 
and she stonewalled me it was unbelievable 
that's the problem here and she's fighting me for that and so then i asked her a question -- i didn't know how i was going to get out of it -- i asked her a question about her days as a playwright and again characteristically instead of saying oh yes i was a playwright and this is what blah blah blah she said oh playwright everybody knows i was a playwright 
she wanted the control of her final moment and she did it amazingly 
his father was an sob and in fact he was another comedian with an unhappy childhood but then we were off and running 
again some of you will know him most of you won't dumas malone 
and here is this man who had given his whole life to uncovering jefferson and connecting with him and he said well  -- i'm going to do a bad southern accent 
i have a story a story that i would like to share with you 
and it's an african story 
and so maybe you're thinking now why how an italian filmmaker based in boston is so interested in this story 
and i was born in zambia 
i have the good fortune of being a filmmaker-in-residence at the center of digital imaging arts at boston university 
there are several themes from the documentary but they are re-edited and made for you ok 
milverton nwokedi you cut a nice movie with just 10000 dollars in nigeria here 
they can afford to watch their robocop and whatever 
because nobody believed that nollywood can come out of africa 
narrator suspense fun and intrigue 
it's the blockbuster comedy 
it is not what you hear you know from the western press 
man let's go 
like they go here now now you see the gun there but you won't see any guns shot we use knock-out 
kevin books ikeduba what i'm scared of is just the explosion will come up in my face 
you know this is nollywood where the magic lives 
but always with a smile always with an enthusiasm that is incredible 
the nigerian filmmakers really really are doing what they like 
and so it's a very very important thing for them and for their audiences 
filmmakers friends of mine they look at nollywood and they say wow they are doing what we really want to do and make a buck and live with this job 
no stories around the campfire 
difficult eh it's meaningless 
i think that the key to a healthy society is a thriving community of storytellers and i think that the nigerian filmmakers really have proved this 
it’s not an added sequence just some voices from nollywood 
and we know that there are more 
they can be rented for pennies 
you can be in a lagos traffic jam and you can buy a movie or some bananas or some water yes 
in fact it appeared in a porno comic book which is the slide on the right 
on the left-hand side i had the context of those little houses and i tried to build a building that fit into that context 
and then i did a law school for loyola in downtown la 
and it was my theory or my point of view that one didn't upstage the neighborhood -- one made accommodations 
i mean the story i tell is that i got mad at postmodernism -- at po-mo -- and said that fish were 500 million years earlier than man and if you're going to go back we might as well go back to the beginning 
and so i started making these funny things 
and the client said why no fish 
it was a dialog with the context again 
couldn't find it 
so  
and it's one of the nicest pieces i've ever made i think 
for reasons we don't want to talk about it got delayed 
i went around toronto and found a bathtub like my grandmother's and i put the fish in 
and we've started to work on things 
the highlight of the performance was at the end 
and so i did a lot of dirty things with chain link which nobody will forgive me for 
it's in perspective and everything 
but we were trying to collide our ideas to put objects next to each other 
like a morandi -- like the little bottles -- composing them like a still life 
and he pushed that 
and it was this interaction between that kind of up-the-ante stuff that became pretty interesting 
and i still think the time magazine picture will be of the binoculars you know leaving out the -- what the hell 
i said if i can't get the craft that i want i'll use the craft i can get 
and it was all of one material and the metal could go on the roof as well as the walls 
i was given an opportunity to design an exhibit for the metalworkers' unions of america and canada in washington and i did it on the condition that they become my partners in the future and help me with all future metal buildings etc etc 
and then more metal and some chain link in santa monica -- a little shopping center 
it gave me an opportunity to make a sculpture out of it 
when you have to do something really cheaply it's hard to get perfect corners and stuff 
he didn't recommend me by the way 
i keep trying to make it work 
it's never been finished 
this is the city hall over here somewhere and the courthouse 
sohio is on the axis here and we followed the axis and they're two kind of goalposts 
and all this stuff at the bottom is a museum and an idea for a very fancy automobile entry 
and following that basic idea of the village we changed it as we got into it 
that's the living room 
you come down from this level along the stairway and you enter the bedroom here going into the lake 
these stonehenge things were designed to give foreground and to create a greater depth in this shallow lot 
i was trying to get around this plan coupe -- how do you do it 
jay chiat is a glutton for punishment and he hired me to do a house for him in the hamptons 
and then this is a kind of a shopping mall with a rodeo and restaurants 
it has a chamber hall 
there's commercial at the ground floor 
the acoustician in the competition gave us criteria which led to this compartmentalized scheme which we found out after the competition would not work at all 
and the ritz-carlton tower is being designed with exposed steel non-fire proof much like those old gas tanks 
and the food wasn't as good as the stuff and so it failed 
thank you very much 
i know bill joy was talking to you about the wonders of carbon nanotubes so i'm going to talk to you about the wonders of carbon macro-tubes which is charcoal 
what we wanted to do was we wanted to find a way to harness this waste resource and turn it into a fuel that would be something that people could easily cook with something like charcoal 
after some time after setting it on fire you seal it to restrict the oxygen that goes into the kiln and then you end up with this carbonized material here 
however you can't burn this it's too fine and it burns too quickly to be useful for cooking 
so we had to try to find a way to form it into useful briquettes 
compared to the sugarcane charcoal where we actually have to teach people how to form it into briquettes and you have the extra step of cooking the binder this comes pre-briquetted 
but this is one of the incredibly rare situations where you also have economic benefits 
they can generate income from this 
they can save the money that they were going to spend on charcoal and they can produce excess and sell it in the market to people who aren't making their own 
i mean the world where advanced building materials means cement roofing tiles that are made by hand and where when you work 10 hours a day you're still only earning 60 dollars in a month 
and more than half of you would be living on less than a dollar a day 
do you need to find entrepreneurs or venture capitalists or what do you need to take what you've got and get it to scale 
these are some of my kids with a salad bar 
and the very first thing was about regional food -- trying to eat food from within our region 
we can't keep feeding our kids pesticides and herbicides and antibiotics and hormones 
the usda allows these antibiotics these hormones and these pesticides in our food supply and the usda paid for this ad in time magazine 
it's no wonder you know we have criminals 
what goes in is what we are 
the cdc the center for disease control has said of the children born in the year 2000 -- those seven- and eight-year-olds today -- one out of every three caucasians one out of every two african-americans and hispanics are going to have diabetes in their lifetime 
and it's because of what we feed them 
this is the usda portion size that little tiny thing 
in case you can't tell that's like pink danish and some kind of cupcakes 
in fact this may be what a lot of parents serve as opposed to -- this is what we try and serve 
there's not a strawberry tree or a carrot bush 
you're not going to get the next generation or the generation after to be able to think like this if they're not nourished 
and these calendars really started to lay out my program 
you know we have to change it 
we have to teach kids that if they're on a diet of refined sugar they go up and down just like if they're on a diet of crack 
and we have to pull it all together we have composting in all of our schools 
because you know what many of us are sort of at the end of our careers and we need to be giving these kids -- these young kids the next generation -- the tools to save themselves and save the planet 
i had 90 employees 
in this country we're spending 110 billion dollars a year on fast food 
that 8 billion comes down to two dollars and 49 cents -- that's what the government allocates for lunch 
and those are the same kids who are going to be getting sick 
look how odd he looks with the eyebrows missing 
max has kindly donated his photograph to me 
our research has shown that the parents and close loved ones of these children adore them 
we crave the approval of our peers 
i'd like you all in the audience now to push your lower jaw forward 
people know now that i'm enthusiastic that i'm a happy person 
he maintained a calm insouciance 
we can categorize it like that 
because you might say well this type of surgery might be regarded as cosmetic 
i'll move it off and we'll have a blank slide for those who are squeamish amongst you 
and again as i told you if they have a caring family and good work life then they can lead normal and fulfilled lives 
so it's not simply a western phenomenon 
we make judgments on people's faces all the time 
good-looking people are always judged as being more friendly 
this is an image of ann who's had her right jaw removed and the base of her skull removed 
so it's very valuable to have that tool in our armamentarium 
but the patients are going to have to take drugs that suppress their immune system for the rest of their lives 
we're still not curing enough patients -- it's the most disfiguring cancer 
we still can't get rid of scars 
whereas i felt that when you design you either improve or you create a detriment to the community in which you're designing in 
working within the united states most people look at poverty and they see the face of a foreigner but go live -- i live in bozeman montana -- go up to the north plains on the reservations or go down to alabama or mississippi pre-katrina and i could have shown you places that have far worse conditions than many developing countries i've been to 
so in the past seven years -- this isn't just about nonprofit 
what it showed me is that there's a grassroots movement going on of socially responsible designers who really believe that this world has got a lot smaller and that we have the opportunity -- not the responsibility but the opportunity -- to really get involved in making change 
so it's really important that if we're designing and trying to create change we build that change 
and it wasn't doctors telling us this it was actual villagers that we were staying with 
we just don't know how to show this 
and on the fourth week the doctors come and they mow out an area put a tensile structure on the top and when the doctors have finished treating and seeing patients and villagers you cut down the clinic and you eat it it's an eat your own clinic 
and you have to keep the maintenance down 
and so we decided to look at the idea of sports and create a youth sports center that doubled as an hiv/aids outreach center and the coaches of the girls' team were also trained doctors 
so this is the designer he's out there working with the first ever women's soccer team in kwa-zulu natal siyathemba and they can tell it better 
video well my name is sisi because i work at the african center 
this was a connection just a meeting with somebody who wanted to develop africa's first telemedicine center in tanzania 
this is a 370-dollar shelter that can be easily assembled 
designing housing this house is going to go in in a couple of weeks 
we put together very quickly a washroom 
this is shandra and the calhouns they're photographers who have documented the lower ninth for the last 40 years 
one billion people live in abject poverty 
if we do nothing about the housing crisis that's about to happen in 20 years one in three people will live in an unplanned settlement or a refugee camp look left look right one of you will be there 
and i want this whole thing to work multi-lingually 
the idea of needs-based competitions -- x-prize for the other 98 percent if you want to call it that 
we also want to look at ways of matchmaking and putting funding partners together 
there should be a sheet i don't have time to read this because i'm going to be yanked off 
so i'm going to speak about a problem that i have and that's that i'm a philosopher 
and i get hoots of derision and cackles and growls because they think that's impossible you can't explain consciousness 
my late lamented friend bob nozick a fine philosopher in one of his books philosophical explanations is commenting on the ethos of philosophy -- the way philosophers go about their business 
i'm sure that people here who work on say climate change and global warming or on the future of the internet encounter people who have very strong opinions about what's going to happen next 
but with regard to consciousness people seem to think each of us seems to think i am an expert 
no other ingredients at all we're just made of cells about 100 trillion of them 
the content -- there's color there's ideas there's memories there's history and somehow all that content of consciousness is accomplished by the busy activity of those hoards of neurons 
so this is the problem so i have to do a little bit of the sort of work that a lot of you won't like for the same reason that you don't like to see a magic trick explained to you 
it's one that i predicted in the last page or two of my 1991 book consciousness explained where i said if you did experiments of this sort you'd find that people were unable to pick up really large changes 
and as i walked towards the picture i was expecting detail that wasn't there 
you're familiar with a more recent technology which is -- there you can get a better view of the blobs 
now what does your brain do when it takes the suggestion 
i don't think so not a chance but then how on earth is it done 
it's the same thing 
the brain isn't actually putting the detail in your head at all 
is the shape on the left the same as the shape on the right rotated 
yes 
and if you read that literature one of the things that you really have to come to terms with is even when you're the subject in the experiment you don't know 
well that's where you have to go backstage and ask the magician 
how many of you see that sort of boundary with the necker cube floating in front of the circles 
can you see it 
when you see the cube one way behind the screen those boundaries go away 
and i supposed that that was just a flat truth always true 
let me just pause this for a second if i can 
so now we're going to be subjects in the experiment 
audience yes 
so 155 seconds is the median time for subjects in his experiment there 
how many still don't see it how many still don't see it 
thank you very much 
and i ever met more humble people 
the mosque where the respectful foreigner is showered with blessings and with tears and welcomed as a gift 
what do we know about the women 10 years after the war 
well the thesis of the bottom billion is that a billion people have been stuck living in economies that have been stagnant for 40 years and hence diverging from the rest of mankind 
the last time the rich world got serious about developing another region was in the late 1940s 
yes you tear up the eleventh commandment -- national sovereignty 
we need to be at least as serious as we were then 
the commodity booms are pumping unprecedented amounts of money into many though not all of the countries of the bottom billion 
so a mass of new discoveries 
just to give you one example angola alone is getting 50 billion dollars a year in oil revenue 
so here comes a bit of science and this is a bit of science i've done since the bottom billion so it's new 
come back 15 years later 
you know how rights to resource extraction are being sold at the moment how they've been sold over the last 40 years 
a company flies in does a deal with a minister 
thank you 
i was an unlikely person to be doing this 
i never studied sculpture engineering or architecture 
it's a self-portrait titled wide hips 
returning to india to work with those fishermen we made a net of a million and a half hand-tied knots -- installed briefly in madrid 
my life was not going to be the same 
next challenge the biennial of the americas in denver asked could i represent the 35 nations of the western hemisphere and their interconnectedness in a sculpture 
i read about the recent earthquake in chile and the tsunami that rippled across the entire pacific ocean 
i started my journey 30 years ago 
and that also brought me to the fact that this poses such a risk to our society 
and together they only form about 15 years of supply 
but now we have a real technology to do this 
when they control their brain they can control their pain 
when you do what do you want to control 
you will be able to look at all the aspects that make you yourself all your experiences 
these are some of the areas we're working on today that i don't have time to go into in detail 
but i want to leave with you the big question 
we are the first generation that's going to be able to enter into using this technology the human mind and brain 
what is worth dying for 
we know that it's possible to live in a failed state where everything that can go wrong does go wrong -- where mothers cannot feed their children where strangers cannot find the basis for peaceful collaboration where people are murdered indiscriminately 
for instance there are 21 states in our country where corporal punishment in the classroom is legal where it is legal for a teacher to beat a child with a wooden board hard and raising large bruises and blisters and even breaking the skin 
but we can ask the obvious question is it a good idea generally speaking to subject children to pain and violence and public humiliation as a way of encouraging healthy emotional development and good behavior 
now many of you might worry that the notion of well-being is truly undefined and seemingly perpetually open to be re-construed 
when this statue was carved the average life expectancy was probably 30 
does not tempt us to say that there are no truths to be known about human nutrition 
many people worry that a universal morality would require moral precepts that admit of no exceptions 
and yet chess is a domain of perfect objectivity 
but what does voluntary mean in a community where when a girl gets raped her father's first impulse rather often is to murder her out of shame 
just let that fact detonate in your brain for a minute your daughter gets raped and what you want to do is kill her 
but if we are in a reflective mood we can ask is this the perfect expression of psychological balance with respect to variables like youth and beauty and women's bodies 
whenever we are talking about facts certain opinions must be excluded 
paint your picture of what rolling the clock 50 years forward 100 years forward how you would like to think of the world balancing moral progress with richness 
but again then we have to talk about well-being in a larger context 
sam this is a conversation i would actually love to continue for hours 
we don't have that but maybe another time thank you for coming to ted 
and then within zoology i took the course or the discipline of entomology the science of insects 
because biological control phenomenon you can see it in your backyard 
so this phenomenon of natural control exists literally everywhere 
so it's everywhere and we need to know how to exploit it 
what damage [does] it actually inflict on the plant 
insects those six-legged organisms and spiders or mites the eight-legged organisms 
on your right-hand side you can see a cucumber leaf and on the middle cotton leaf and on the left a tomato leaf with these little stipplings 
by the way it's springtime now in israel 
when temperature rises sharply you can see those bad ones those aphids all over the plants in your hibiscus in your lantana in the young fresh foliage of the spring flush so-called 
this is all natural this is all natural 
again we'll start first with the pest the thrips 
this is a sweet pepper which is not consumable because it is suffering from a viral disease transmitted by those thrip adults 
many different parts 
by the way they have a very nice landscape -- you see the jordanian mountains on the one hand and the jordan valley on the other hand and a good mild winter and a nice hot summer which is an excellent condition to mass-produce those creatures 
here we come with those natural enemies in order to reverse a little bit of the wheel and to bring more natural balance to the agricultural plot by reducing those chemicals 
in this table you can actually see what is an impact of a successful biological control by good bugs 
but if we go for example to this place southeast israel the arava area above the great rift valley where the really top-notch -- the pearl of the israeli agriculture is located especially under greenhouse conditions or under screenhouse conditions -- if you drive all the way to eilat you see this just in the middle of the desert 
step by step it does narrow 
so i'm saying it on behalf of all the biocontrol petitioners and implementers in israel and abroad really give nature a chance 
how can we understand what makes some societies more fragile than other societies the problem is obviously relevant to our situation today because today as well there are some societies that have already collapsed such as somalia and rwanda and the former yugoslavia there are also societies today that may be close to collapse such as nepal indonesia and columbia 
what is there that we can learn from the past that would help us avoid declining or collapsing in the way that so many past societies have 
why did they all end up dead well in my five-point framework the first item on the framework is to look for human impacts on the environment people inadvertently destroying the resource base on which they depend and in the case of the viking norse the vikings inadvertently caused soil erosion and deforestation which was a particular problem for them because they required forests to make charcoal to make iron 
or again the collapse of the soviet union took place within a couple of decades maybe within a decade of the time when the soviet union was at its greatest power 
so this is a frequent theme societies collapse very soon after reaching their peak in power 
and i would expect that if our human civilization carries on then maybe in the next century people will be asking why on earth did these people today in the year 2003 not see the obvious things that they were doing and take corrective action 
one blueprint for trouble making collapse likely is where there is a conflict of interest between the short-term interest of the decision-making elites and the long-term interest of the society as a whole especially if the elites are able to insulate themselves from the consequences of their actions where what's good in the short run for the elite is bad for the society as a whole there's a real risk of the elite doing things that would bring the society down in the long run 
so that's one general conclusion about why societies make bad decisions conflicts of interest 
instead all the major threats facing us today are problems entirely of our own making and since we made the problems we can also solve the problems that then means that it's entirely in our power to deal with these problems 
so i think i'm actually the first one here -- i lead 
and meanwhile i use nonsense as you can see 
this was one of a series called zany afternoons which became a book 
but the zeppelin was the biggest thing that ever moved made by man 
there's moscow shirley hope they speak esperanto 
those for example are mark iv british tanks from 1916 
happy little story isn't it 
anybody who was anybody had an apartment there 
it's obviously modeled on the titanic 
i thought i could jazz it up a bit have a little fun with it 
this is the word side of my brain 
and then when it ran a lovely lady an old lady named mrs edgar rosenberg -- if you know that name -- called me and said she loved the cover it was so sweet 
pretty elegant nothing like a crash to end a joke that completes my oeuvre 
okay i'm going to show you again something about our diets 
there's six million species of insects on this planet six million species 
there was an estimation a conservative estimation a couple of years ago that the us economy benefited by 57 billion dollars per year 
small animals eat insects 
and here you see me enjoying a meal with caterpillars locusts bee pupae -- delicacies 
you're eating at least 500 grams per year 
we're even doing this on purpose 
now the situation in the world is going to change for you and me for everyone on this earth 
there was an fao conference last october that was completely devoted to this 
and we eat quite a lot of it 
in the developing world it's much lower 
so if you would be an entrepreneur what would you do 
i gave you at least four arguments in favor 
there are entrepreneurs in the netherlands that produce them and one of them is here in the audience marian peeters who's in the picture 
well in the netherlands we have an innovative minister of agriculture and she puts the insects on the menu in her restaurant in her ministry 
reset the three minutes that's just not fair 
i would still be on my bad hip that was so disappointing 
great excellent 
so no suddenly i wasn't averse to butting any geezer off the list 
they were desperate for volunteers because the average age of the volunteer at the hospital gift shop was 75 
so next thing you know i had my bright blue volunteer vest i had my photo id and i was fully trained by my 89-year-old boss 
i draped them casually over the chair in the doctor's office 
but i'd like to ask you how would you tell the time if you didn't have an iphone 
you know i've always wanted one of these 
and this one this is a replica from a 15th-century device 
so tonight if it's clear you'll be able to see the summer triangle 
step three is identify the star on the front of the device 
he would know what time the sun would rise and what time it would set 
probably not one made of brass he would have one made out of wood or paper and the vast majority of this first computer was a portable device that you could keep in the back of your pocket 
so what does the astrolabe inspire 
and what we gain with a new technology of course is precision and accuracy 
i'm just going to show you how the robot works 
so even though there is nothing in nature that looks like this really we were inspired by biology and applying the principles of walking to this robot thus it's a biologically inspired robot 
we want to fold up the legs and shoot it up for long-range motion 
we developed our adaptive gait planner 
welcome to romela the robotics mechanisms laboratory at virginia tech 
this robot is an amoeba robot 
robotic air powered hand with elastic ligaments 
we wanted to go tackle this problem in a very different direction 
so for example in iraq you know the war zone there is roadside bombs currently you send these remotely controlled vehicles that are armed 
we actually have a fan club for the robot darwin dynamic anthropomorphic robot with intelligence 
so based on that success the following year we did the proper mechanical design starting from kinematics 
and thus darwin i was born in 2005 
dennis hong so there is actually a competition called robocup 
we were the very first team in the united states that qualified in the humanoid robocup competition 
we truly believe this is going to be the very first running humanoid robot in the united states so stay tuned 
how do we develop these kinds of ideas 
we have a fully autonomous vehicle that can drive into urban environments we won a half a million dollars in the darpa urban challenge 
we also have the world's very first vehicle that can be driven by the blind 
he gave a talk about how education and school kills creativity 
for us roboticists engineers and scientists these tools these are the courses and classes you take in class 
these are all the tools that we need 
bertie county is kind of a prime example in the demise of rural america 
there are more buildings that are empty or in disrepair than occupied and in use 
he was brought in in october 2007 as the new superintendent to basically fix this broken school system 
so in february of 2009 dr zullinger invited us project h design -- which is a non-profit design firm that i founded -- to come to bertie and to partner with him on the repair of this school district and to bring a design perspective to the repair of the school district 
we now call this place home 
but beyond our personal reasons for wanting to be there there is a huge need 
it allows elementary-level students to learn core subjects through game play and activity and running around and screaming and being a kid 
so the first batch of computers are being installed later this summer and we're helping dr zullinger develop some strategies around how we might connect the classroom and the home to extend learning beyond the school day 
so we thought what if you could bring back shop class but this time orient the projects around things that the community needed and to infuse shop class with a more critical and creative-design-thinking studio process 
so over the course of two semesters the fall and the spring the students spend three hours a day every single day in our 4500 square foot studio/shop space 
so what studio h might offer her is a way to develop skills so that she might give back in the most meaningful way 
so for him studio h offers him a way to develop the skills he will need as an architect everything from drafting to wood and metal construction to how to do research for a client 
and going out into the community and interviewing your neighbors about what kind of food they buy and from where and why -- that's a homework assignment 
because when you zoom out that far you lose the ability to view people as humans 
if you are a blind child in india you will very likely have to contend with at least two big pieces of bad news 
so i felt that i needed to do two things 
here's the eye with the opaque lens the opaque lens extracted and an acrylic lens inserted 
in fact the story holds true even if you have a person who got sight after several years of deprivation 
so the way we study that is let's say we find a child who has light sensitivity 
and we've used this general approach to study many different visual proficiencies but i want to highlight one particular one and that is image parsing into objects 
so any image of the kind that you see on the left be it a real image or a synthetic image it's made up of little regions that you see in the middle column regions of different colors different luminances 
and nobody knows how this integration happens and that's the question we asked with project prakash 
doctor what are their shapes 
doctor now 
so we are creating dylan which is a computational system with an ambitious goal of taking in visual inputs of the same kind that a human child would receive and autonomously discovering what are the objects in this visual input 
here's what a baby-cam video looks like 
what's amazing is that working with such highly degraded input the baby very quickly is able to discover meaning in such input 
even before the ball gets to a place the child is already looking there 
so to summarize prakash in its five years of existence it's had an impact in multiple areas ranging from basic neuroscience plasticity and learning in the brain to clinically relevant hypotheses like in autism the development of autonomous machine vision systems education of the undergraduate and graduate students and most importantly in the alleviation of childhood blindness 
you know he's thinking what am i getting myself into 
and he said no no really you can 
and no disabled person had ever done that -- run at a collegiate level 
it was really really hot 
and it's the first -- i had just gotten these new sprinting legs that you see in that bio and i didn't realize at that time that the amount of sweating i would be doing in the sock -- it actually acted like a lubricant and i'd be kind of pistoning in the socket 
he kept me on the right track 
everyone was taking pictures -- what is this girl running on 
i'm sitting there like oh my god oh my god 
so they call us out and you know -- ladies you have one minute 
and i had to think why did i do this 
you know show us more than one set of legs 
no these are my cosmetic legs actually and they're absolutely beautiful 
it has a shock absorber in it so it like shhhh makes this neat sound when you jump around on it all right 
in these 
for me while i'm such a serious athlete on the track i want to be feminine off the track and i think it's so important not to be limited in any capacity whether it's you know your mobility or even fashion 
i mean i love the fact that i can go in anywhere and pick out what i want -- the shoes i want the skirts i want -- and i'm hoping to try to bring these over here and make them accessible to a lot of people 
two weeks ago aimee was up for the arthur ashe award at the espys 
they didn't even want to touch that one they just did it 
what we're looking at here is the insidious cost of ringtone piracy 
but now you can find out all about -- unfortunately my weight is a little higher than that but -- all about what happens 
so i think in terms of the fact that math has been liberated from calculating 
it's the chore 
computers allow us to do that -- and this is not a small problem by any means 
that's an amazing amount of human endeavor 
and i'll say hmm not sure i'll think about it roughly 
well one of them is they say you need to get the basics first 
that somehow if you use a computer it's all mindless button-pushing but if you do it by hand it's all intellectual 
might have been 50 years ago but it isn't anymore 
why are we using computers to show a student how to solve a problem by hand that the computer should be doing anyway 
same principles applied -- calculations harder 
so the problem we've really got in math education is not that computers might dumb it down but that we have dumbed-down problems right now 
so if you go through lots of examples you can get the answer you can understand how the basics of the system work better 
so programming is the way i think we should be doing that 
this was an example i built for my daughter 
you can see that this is a very early step into limits and differential calculus and what happens when you take things to an extreme -- and very small sides and a very large number of sides 
and yet that's a really important practical view of the world 
it's like the land and the king  they're inseparable they are one 
the contract is the same as with real word objects in real world containers 
and finally to pull out all the stops this is a system called urp for urban planners in which we give architects and urban planners back the models that we confiscated when we insisted that they use cad systems 
it projects down digital shadows as you see here 
there are inter-shadowing studies that children can operate even though they don't know anything about urban planning to move a building you simply reach out your hand and you move the building 
this work is 15 years old 
and the great thing about it was that alex was so dedicated to the idea of verisimilitude the idea that the putative 2054 that we were painting in the film be believable that he allowed us to take on that design work as if it were an r&ampd effort 
and the result is sort of gratifyingly perpetual 
people still reference those sequences in minority report when they talk about new ui design 
these are logistics elements that are scattered across the united states 
this is a system called tamper which is a slightly whimsical look at what the future of editing and media manipulation systems might be 
we'll go over to jacques tati here and grab our blue friend and put him down on the table as well 
let me leave with one final thought and that is that one of the greatest english language writers of the last three decades suggested that great art is always a gift 
can it be for every man or is this just for corporations and movie producers 
that's our goal entirely 
so this is the inevitability about it 
i just like to dive right in and become sort of a human guinea pig 
it was a wonderful experience 
you can just google it 
as i say in my book i'm jewish in the same way the olive garden is italian 
the first thing i did was i got a stack of bibles 
i had christian bibles 
so i wanted to follow that rule 
and there were two types of laws that were particularly challenging 
but it's a big part of the bible so i figured i had to address it 
i wanted to see how dressing biblically affected my mind 
and i explained my project and he said well i am an adulterer are you going to stone me 
they really did a fantastic job 
i wanted it to be about religion in america 
so this was very inspiring to me 
i recommend jim wallis and tony campolo 
they're very inspiring leaders even though i disagree with much of what they say 
and i would say but that's crazy 
the key is to pick and choose the right parts 
there's the phrase called cafeteria religion and the fundamentalists will use it in a denigrating way and they'll say oh it's just cafeteria religion 
you're just picking and choosing 
the story starts in kenya in december of 2007 when there was a disputed presidential election and in the immediate aftermath of that election there was an outbreak of ethnic violence 
and she quickly said it's too much 
and enough people looked at it and found it valuable enough that the programmers who created ushahidi decided they were going to make it open source and turn it into a platform 
and it represents the ability of the world's population to volunteer and to contribute and collaborate on large sometimes global projects 
and once they've done it they can do it again and they could work on getting it better 
even with the sacred printing press we got erotic novels 150 years before we got scientific journals 
so before i talk about what is i think the critical difference between lolcats and ushahidi i want to talk about their shared source 
at pick-up time the teachers who have been with your children all day would like you to be there at the appointed hour to take your children back 
late pick-ups went up every week for the next four weeks until they topped out at triple the pre-fine average and then they fluctuated at between double and triple the pre-fine average for the life of the fine 
they were operating with social constraints rather than contractual ones 
it's value created by the participants but enjoyed by society as a whole 
the goals set out by ushahidi are not just to make life better for the participants but to make life better for everyone in the society in which ushahidi is operating 
we've got a choice before us 
and may it run forever because it gives people like me a living 
there were two sundays in between but of course sundays are church days so you don't play on sundays and one day it rained so they all sat around making friends with each other 
and then you worked out your strategy and you came and fought the next day and you went back home again 
take a look you could play it in the dump with some rocks over there you could play it in a little alley -- you couldn't hit square anywhere because the bat hit the wall don't forget the air conditioning and the cable wires 
as you can see you can play anywhere 
and we won this world cup in 1983 
and so we allowed multinationals into india 
we cut customs duties we reduced import duties and we got all the multinationals coming in with multinational budgets who looked at per-capita income and got very excited about the possibilities in india and were looking for a vehicle to reach every indian 
but what a game we had m s dhoni got it right in the air but misbah-ul-haq what a player 
a massive massive success india the world tt champions 
so it was a different india 
now all of the sudden if you were to bowl a shot -- if mumbai were to bowl a shot for example they needn't go to kalbadevi or shivaji park or somewhere to source them they could go to trinidad 
so he played in hyderabad went straight after the game went from the stadium to hyderabad airport sat in a private corporate jet -- first refueling in portugal second refueling in brazil he was in west indies in time 
they started going to the cricket to watch shah rukh khan 
for a long time india was this country of poverty dust beggars snake charmers filth delhi belly -- people heard delhi belly stories before they came 
hopefully it'll make everyone richer hopefully it'll make the game bigger and hopefully it'll give cricket commentators more time in the business 
we all make decisions every day we want to know what the right thing is to do -- in domains from the financial to the gastronomic to the professional to the romantic 
and surely if somebody could really tell us how to do exactly the right thing at all possible times that would be a tremendous gift 
this is what statisticians technically call a damn fine bet 
calculating odds would seem to be something rather easy there are six sides to a die two sides to a coin 52 cards in a deck 
it's because the mind recalls words by their first letter 
why in the world would anybody ever play the lottery 
well there are many answers but one answer surely is we see a lot of winners right when this couple wins the lottery or ed mcmahon shows up at your door with this giant check -- how the hell do you cash things that size i don't know 
when was the last time that you saw extensive interviews with everybody who lost 
you can't say to yourself i'm as likely to win as anybody because you're not as likely to win as leroy 
because they had the sense that declining wages are worse than rising wages even when the total amount of wages is higher in the declining period here's another nice example 
here's a $2000 hawaiian vacation package it's now on sale for 1600 
this tendency to compare to the past is causing people to pass up the better deal in other words a good deal that used to be a great deal is not nearly as good as an awful deal that was once a horrible deal 
now just in case you're not getting it here's a schematic of what happened ok 
the difference is that when you lost the ticket you say to yourself i'm not paying twice for the same thing 
nonetheless their predictions are perverted by a comparison that then does not carry through and change their experience 
when you go to buy groceries with it it doesn't go i'm the money saved on the car stereo or i'm the dumb money saved on the car it's money 
and if a drive across town is worth 100 bucks it's worth 100 bucks no matter what you're saving it on people don't think that way 
well by and large people are enormously impatient 
imagine that you can have 50 dollars in a year -- that's 12 months -- or 60 dollars in 13 months 
this is just a graph showing the results that i just suggested you would show if i gave you time to respond which is people find that the subjective value of 50 is higher than the subjective value of 60 when they'll be delivered in now or one month respectively -- a 30-day delay -- but they show the reverse pattern when you push the entire decision off into the future a year 
what causes the bug is it the drama of the event -- that it's so spectacular 
i don't want to say -- please i'm going to get quoted somewhere as saying terrorism is fine and we shouldn't be so distressed 
what i'm saying is that surely rationally our distress about things that happen about threats should be roughly proportional to the size of those threats and threats to come 
there's no question 
and so we evolved these responses 
it turns out that the value of buying a lottery ticket is not winning 
that's what you think it is all right 
and as a result many people look at economists as stupid people 
it's the sequel to an inconvenient truth and it explores all the solutions that will solve the climate crisis 
or we can scroll through the pages at the bottom 
mike matas and so throughout the whole book al gore will walk you through and explain the photos 
this photo you can you can even see on an interactive map 
and while it's playing we can pinch and peak back at the page and the movie keeps playing 
this is very strange for me because i’m not used to doing this i usually stand on the other side of the light and now i'm feeling the pressure i put other people into and it's hard  
so we’ll go with the first piece 
court i don't want to get rid of you 
boy look man reading don't feed no one 
boy arguing with you is a waste of time marcus 
marcus when a man resorts to profanities it’s a sure sign of his inability to express himself 
did you ever move your fuckin' ass from hollywood to go and film something real 
the first piece was really there's a young woman talking about nigeria that she has a feeling she'll be happy there 
so that whole thing that whole childhood echoes and takes me into the next piece 
commander soldiers you are going to fight a battle so you must get ready and willing to die 
c success the change is only coming through the barrel of the gun 
i don’t remember how we got there 
the injection made us not to have mind 
various voices you will die you will die  
onicha ezra  
why you giving these to me 
mr ezra gelehun please stand 
no we don’t 
mr gelehun i'd like to remind you you're not on trial here today 
you are not on trial 
e so you are a liar 
thank you 
in the process of my research i actually spent a bit of time in sierra leone researching this 
i met psychosocial workers who worked with them 
frank gehry i listened to this scientist this morning 
i mean it is astonishing for an artist for an architect to become actually an icon and a legend in their own time 
and i realized when i'd come into the meetings with these corrugated metal and chain link stuff and people would just look at me like i'd just landed from mars 
and like the playwright said the other day -- i could relate to him you're not sure 
yeah 
there aren't many people around that are really involved with architecture as clients 
if you think about the world and even just in this audience most of us are involved with buildings 
i knew craig and respected him 
i knew you'd ask that question 
i tried to understand that language as a beginning as a place to jump off and there was so much of it being done by spec builders and it was trivialized so much that it wasn't  
siza on the other hand continued in portugal where the real stuff was and evolved a modern language that relates to that historic language 
i tried to get him a couple of jobs and they didn't pan out 
where you  it's like jazz you improvise you work together you play off each other you make something they make something 
richard koshalek [unclear] starts from 2004 
you can come to the opening i'll invite you 
i'd seen drawings you had presented here at ted 
they came for three days 
you've all heard the frank lloyd wright story when the woman called and said mr wright i'm sitting on the couch and the water's pouring in on my head 
rsw didn't get a laugh 
what do you bring to it 
that's what reminded me of it 
just before going to lunch with the mayor we went to the harbor commissioner 
we sat down and we had a drink of water and everybody was quiet 
so i got up 
they just brought us there to hustle this group you know to create a project 
because i want to get a standing ovation like everybody so  
but reliable dutchman --  -- fantastic 
and this was the text -- in words as fashion the same rule will hold/ alike fantastic if too new or old/ be not the first by whom the new are tried/ nor yet the last to lay the old aside 
so it was going nowhere 
that's what happens 
silas usually has a better touch with his choice of quotations 
don't be trendy if you want to be serious 
but we don't have time 
there were 10 artists invited to participate in it and it was one of those things where it was extremely competitive and i didn't want to be embarrassed so i worked very hard on this 
but i was absolutely stuck on the idea of art is and trying to determine what art was 
we've watched the financial markets that we uniquely create -- these markets that were supposed to be foolproof -- we've watched them kind of collapse before our eyes 
and of course if we are put in environments where we can't deal with it in some sense makes sense that we actually might mess certain things up 
it feels like we might almost just be built to make errors in certain ways 
so this is the question my students and i wanted to get at 
what if we put holly into the same context as humans 
because you know it's great for us but bad for humans 
they were these kind of weird things 
so the monkeys get really good at this 
the monkeys would rip-off the tokens at every available opportunity -- from each other often from us -- you know things we didn't necessarily think we were introducing but things we spontaneously saw 
we were a little impatient so we wanted to sort of speed things up a bit 
sounds great but you get one more choice to earn a little bit more money 
your other option is a bit safe your just going to get some money for sure 
so see what your intuition is here 
most people say why should i be risky when i can get 1500 dollars for sure 
and now imagine that i have you make another choice but this time it's a little bit worse 
they actually tend to go a little risky 
and this means that sometimes we'll actually switch our preferences to avoid this 
what you saw in that last scenario is that subjects get risky because they want the small shot that there won't be any loss 
they're why stock investors hold onto losing stocks longer -- because they're evaluating them in relative terms 
the question we were interested in is whether the monkeys show the same biases 
sometimes the monkeys get no bonus -- so this is a bonus of zero 
now the monkeys meet two guys who aren't giving them bonuses they're actually giving them less than they expect 
so you know a little bad -- sorry sorry sorry 
when you're watching your stocks plummet into the red when you're watching your house price go down you're not going to be able to see that in anything but old evolutionary terms 
but we have to recognize that we have those limitations 
we have this great north and there was a pretty small population and my father was an avid outdoorsman 
but what i think it was telling me is that we are this transient thing that's happening and that the nature that you see out there -- the untouched shorelines the untouched forest that i was able to see -- really bring in a sense of that geological time that this has gone on for a long time and we're experiencing it in a different way 
this rebirth of grass and then i went out for years trying to photograph the pristine landscape 
so there's this thing that is pulling me in both directions 
but we've become totally disconnected from them 
that if we keep putting things through industrial and urban existence back into the system -- if we keep doing that -- we can continue on 
because i think everything that we're involved in -- our clothing our cars our roads and everything -- are directly a result 
i'm going to move to some pictures of china 
so this created a reservoir 600 kilometers long one of the largest reservoirs ever created 
and again the rebuilding of the city -- to me it was sad to see that they didn't really grab a lot of i guess what we know here in terms of urban planning 
this is a shot in one of the biggest squares in guangdong -- and this is where a lot of migrant workers are coming in from the country 
so this is a pink uniform at this factory it's a shoe factory 
and they have dorms for the workers 
this is one with 45000 so every lunch there's about 12000 coming through for lunch 
they sit down they have about 20 minutes 
they're not getting enough so they're not going to move 
shanghai was a very intriguing city -- it's exploding on a level that i don't think any city has experienced 
in fact even shenzhen the economic zone -- one of the first ones -- 15 years ago was about 100000 people and today it boasts about 10 to 11 million 
so this is three of the visible blast furnaces within that shot 
i think one of the issues that we here are facing with china is that they're using a lot of the latest production technology 
but that is the trick that they've got right now that they're winning with is that they're using all the latest technologies and extrusion machines and bringing all the components into play but the assembly is where they're actually bringing in -- the country workers are very willing to work they want to work 
i had to have them freeze for 10 seconds to get this shot 
there are 500 of these machines they're worth about 200000 dollars each 
so you have about 12 people running this and they're just inspecting it -- and they're just walking the lines 
this was one of the biggest factories i've ever seen 
but this is what happens to most of the computers 
and as much as there are great things around the corner -- and it's palpable in this room -- of all of the things that are just about to break that can solve so many problems i'm really hoping that those things will spread around the world and will start to have a positive effect 
some of you might know he's a tedster -- stephen sagmeister and i are working on some layouts and this is still in preliminary stages these aren't the finals but these images with worldchangingcom can be placed into any kind of media 
so we're looking at this as trying to build out 
and anything that you can do to promote that would be fantastic 
that would be fantastic so those are my three wishes 
and i'd like to start at the very beginning 
the more stuff that's mine the better 
and of course it's your stuff if it's broken 
and they extract the metals by hand 
so about 20 years ago i literally started in my garage tinkering around trying to figure out how to separate these very similar materials from each other and eventually enlisted a lot of my friends in the mining world actually and in the plastics world and we started going around to mining laboratories around the world 
and instead of plopping down several hundred million dollars to build a chemical plant that will only make one type of plastic for its entire life our plants can make any type of plastic we feed them 
we use a very highly automated process to sort those plastics not only by type but by grade 
so i hope i've changed the way you look at at least some of the stuff in your life 
mother nature wastes very little reuses practically everything 
and i hope that you stop looking at yourself as a consumer -- that's a label i've always hated my entire life -- and think of yourself as just using resources in one form until they can be transformed to another form for another use later in time 
now it was not always wonderful at that table 
in fact you could come down to the tree to get your gifts and get ready to sing and then get ready for breakfast without even taking a bath or getting dressed except that daddy messed it up 
now that's compassion 
so let me tell you i kind of look at the world this way 
i see -- always it stirs my heart -- a picture of dr martin luther king jr 
this is the picture they said it's going to be too volatile for you to go 
we are so connected that we must treat each other as if an action toward you is an action toward myself 
and whatever else is needed i will provide it and pay for it when i return 
this always seemed to me to be a deepening of the sense of what it means to be a good samaritan 
but now to be a good samaritan -- and i always say and to be a good american -- for me is not simply to congratulate myself for the individual acts of care 
and if mama eternal has taught us correctly this song will make sense not only to those of us who are a part of this gathering but to all who sign the charter for compassion 
i just want to say my name is emmanuel jal 
and also telling it like now 
and also the easiest one was when i was doing it in form of a music 
i wanted to revenge for my village 
my every moment 
run duck play dead and hide 
but still as i wonder i won't go under 
i was ready to eat 
give us tools give the farmers tools 
and now we have a couple in university 
♫ what would i be ♫ ♫ if emma never rescued me ♫ ♫ what would i be ♫ ♫ another starving refugee ♫ ♫ what would i be ♫ ♫ if emma never rescued me ♫ ♫ yeah yeah ♫ ♫ yeah i would have probably died from starvation ♫ ♫ or some other wretched disease ♫ ♫ i would have grown up with no education ♫ ♫ just another refugee ♫  thank you 
we've used fear if you like to grab people's attention 
a deer freezes very very still poised to run away 
and i think that's what we're doing when we're asking people to engage with our agenda around environmental degradation and climate change 
and unsurprisingly people all around the world say that what they want is happiness for themselves for their families their children their communities 
okay they think money is slightly important 
it thinks in terms of how much bang do we get for our buck 
they are doing that on a quarter of the resources that are used typically in [the] western world -- a quarter of the resources 
what's happening in costa rica 
99 percent of their electricity comes from renewable resources 
and so in strict happy-planet methodology we've become less efficient at turning our ultimate scarce resource into the outcome we want to 
a child entering school today will be my age in 2050 
and i put it to you that is not business as usual 
i think we want the lot of humanity to keep on increasing 
and the point of these is they are not quite the secrets of happiness but they are things that i think happiness will flow out the side from 
keep building them 
the second one is be active 
based on a lot of evidence for mindfulness cognitive behavioral therapy [very] strong for our well being 
they don't need a lot of material goods to be satisfied 
all that being good and no real credit for it 
so i said well mom and dad what about santa claus 
santa would come to our house while we were at nine o'clock high mass on christmas morning but only if all of us kids did not make a fuss 
there's only one obvious conclusion to reach from this mountain of evidence our family was too strange and weird for even santa claus to come visit and my poor parents were trying to protect us from the embarrassment this humiliation of rejection by santa who was jolly -- but let's face it he was also very judgmental 
they had to fit two criteria they had to be old enough to be able to understand the whole concept of the age of reason and not yet seven 
i just realized that the age of reason starts when you turn seven and then you're capable of committing any and all sins against god and man and bill said so and then i said so you're six you have a whole year to do anything you want to and god won't notice it and he said so and i said so so everything and i turned to run i was so angry with him 
and she said listen the cut-off date to start kindergarten was september 15 
so i took the bus downtown to get the new libra poster 
now i was raised in the pacific northwest around a lot of church of latter-day saints people and you know i've worked with them and even dated them but i never really knew the doctrine or what they said to people when they were out on a mission and i guess i was sort of curious so i said well please come in and they looked really happy because i don't think this happens to them all that often 
and i sat them down and i got them glasses of water -- ok i got it i got them glasses of water 
and they told me this story all about this guy named lehi who lived in jerusalem in 600 bc 
i wanted to say ok don't start with this story 
i said oh come on i mean even if women tried to have a baby every single year from the time they were 15 to the time they were 45 assuming they didn't die from exhaustion it still seems like some women would have some time left over to hear the word of god and they said no 
and they said oh -- hey well we also believe that when you go to heaven you get your body restored to you in its best original state 
or if you'd gone blind you could see 
if someone came to my door and i was hearing catholic theology and dogma for the very first time and they said we believe that god impregnated a very young girl without the use of intercourse and the fact that she was a virgin is maniacally important to us --  -- and she had a baby and that's the son of god i mean i would think that's equally ridiculous 
yes breast cancer 
overcome with the enormity of it all and the complete feeling of loss of control i shed copious tears and asked my dear husband jayant 
i danced between chemo and radiation cycles and badgered him to fit it to my performing dance schedule 
it's the power of bringing ourselves to the attention of something that so animates you so moves you that something even like cancer becomes insignificant 
it's the power of an image 
nobody really did anything with it pretty much 
they brought all sorts of different computers with them 
so that in all that diversity if i wanted to figure out how to build something out of a bit of this and a bit of this everything i looked into i had to connect to some new machine i had to learn to run some new program i would find the information i wanted in some new data format 
and that is what has made it most fun 
they're much more than we'd originally imagined when we put together the little initial website that we started off with 
one of the great -- yes a lot of people have seen it -- one of the great ted talks 
hans put up this presentation in which he showed for various different countries in various different colors -- he showed income levels on one axis and he showed infant mortality and he shot this thing animated through time 
so he'd taken this data and made a presentation which just shattered a lot of myths that people had about the economics in the developing world 
it had underground all the data ok data is brown and boxy and boring and that's how we think of it isn't it 
in this case hans had put the data together he had found from all kinds of united nations websites and things 
we're using them for people we're using them for places we're using them for your products we're using them for events 
i wrote an article entitled linked data a couple of years ago and soon after that things started to happen 
ok we have to ask for raw data now 
practice that it's important because you have no idea the number of excuses people come up with to hang onto their data and not give it to you even though you've paid for it as a taxpayer 
the people who are going to solve those -- the scientists -- they have half-formed ideas in their head they try to communicate those over the web 
and that is what linked data is all about 
you get this really huge power out of it 
then i realized that what i was getting from giving was a narcissistic hit -- that i felt good about myself 
right now as bill mcdonough has pointed out the objects that we buy and use have hidden consequences 
and i spent a couple of weeks going around with a social work agency that ministered to the homeless and i realized seeing the homeless through their eyes that almost all of them were psychiatric patients that had nowhere to go they had a diagnosis it made me -- what it did was to shake me out of the urban trance where when we see when we're passing someone who's homeless in the periphery of our vision it stays on the periphery 
one day soon after that -- it was a friday -- at the end of the day i went down -- i was going down to the subway it was rush hour and thousands of people were streaming down the stairs 
and anyway the next morning we had to go along to the jeweler and get it cut off 
and then yes all these other ones as well i mean how do you do this 
so i suppose you're not going to be able to kick me off the stage since you asked the question 
so just help us with some of the numbers 
i mean how big is the group overall 
no i mean i think -- ca but is that your hair 
ok 
of course 
yeah well 25 years earlier we'd launched the sex pistols' god save the queen and i'd certainly never expected that 25 years later -- that she'd actually knight us 
well i got pulled out of the sea i think six times by helicopters so -- and each time i didn't expect to come home to tell the tale 
but the ends of all those balloon trips were you know -- something seemed to go wrong every time and on that particular occasion the more experienced balloonist who was with me jumped and left me holding on for dear life 
yeah no i put on my oxygen mask and stood on top of the balloon with my parachute looking at the swirling clouds below trying to pluck up my courage to jump into the north sea which -- and it was a very very very lonely few moments 
the years -- and until i stopped looking at the polls you were sort of regarded as this great hero in the uk and elsewhere 
ok this isn't exactly hardball ok 
didn't -- weren't you just terrible at school 
and generally the people would say oh well that's bad news 
did this really happen 
and making us go on wonderful long bike rides 
but is there a risk here 
i was actually prosecuted under two quite ancient acts in the uk 
we changed it to social diseases and people came along with acne and spots but nobody came with vd any more 
and john mortimer the playwright defended us 
so seriously is there a dark side 
there was a nasty biography written about you by someone 
i mean do you think about life balance 
but the problem with capitalism is extreme wealth ends up in the hands of a few people and therefore extreme responsibility i think goes with that wealth 
and is there a risk that the kind of the business heroes of the west get so excited about -- i mean they're used to having an idea getting stuff done and they believe profoundly in their ability to make a difference in the world 
but i think business leaders can bring their entrepreneurial know-how and help governments approach things slightly differently 
well richard when i was starting off in business i knew nothing about it and i also was sort of -- i thought that business people were supposed to just be ruthless and that that was the only way you could have a chance of succeeding 
so i would like to thank you for that inspiration and for coming to ted today thank you 
i would say with a great smile i will definitely pass 
he just started asking where did you buy the radio how much is it 
and he said oh i teach at a college of arts 
it can be ruins or it can be music or it can be painting or drawing or writing whatever it is 
but it is just a kind of trace of that time 
so it took about 24 hours to get this line 
so what we see is just what we think often and most of the time we don't see what it is 
so this work from this period is mostly like -- you know this is a work called light makes dark 
this is an exact negative 
but a solution arrived after being quiet and not working for about six seven months in the restroom when i was changing the air freshener that goes from solid substance to vapor 
this is the work i made out of that material 
so i told them i'd like to start an air freshener company 
so i just started doing this work to inquire further about how to sculpt the space between this object and there 
because as a visual artist if i'm seeing this and i'm seeing that -- but how to sculpt this you know 
it's the same in marketing 
it only took one robust observation from copernicus to blow that idea out of the water 
take bp -- they spent millions of pounds over many years building up its credentials as an environmentally friendly brand but then one little accident 
the same is true of marketing 
it makes this distribution of energy a democratizing force which is ultimately good for your brand 
i see you're all up on the history of hurdy-gurdy -- vielle à roue 
it's also the only instrument that uses this kind of technique 
and today the hurdy-gurdy is used in all sorts of music -- traditional folk music dance contemporary and world music -- in the uk in france in spain and in italy 
but the moment you fall in love you become extremely sexually possessive of them 
but the main characteristics of romantic love are craving an intense craving to be with a particular person not just sexually but emotionally 
and then the very last question i would ask them -- i would always have to work myself up to this question because i am not a psychologist 
the motor of the brain it's a drive 
and in fact i think it's more powerful than the sex drive 
you know you can feel it when you're just driving along in your car 
i think romantic love evolved to enable you to focus your mating energy on just one individual at a time thereby conserving mating time and energy 
they've got incredible people skills negotiating skills 
they're highly imaginative 
and -- basic math  
we are seeing the rise of female sexual expression 
indeed arranged marriages are on their way off this braid of human life 
i even think that marriages might even become more stable because of the second great world trend 
it may decline some more 
not at any time on this planet have women been so educated so interesting so capable 
however there's always kinds of complications in this 
in these three brain systems lust romantic love and attachment -- don't always go together 
but i want to tell you a story about -- to illustrate 
i've been carrying on here about the biology of love 
and wasn't that rickshaw driver handsome 
these circuits are deeply embedded in the human brain 
they're going to survive as long as our species survives on what shakespeare called this mortal coil 
one of the threads that seems to have come through loud and clear in the last couple of days is this need to reconcile what the big wants -- the big being the organization the system the country -- and what the small wants -- the individual the person 
charlie ledbetter yesterday i thought talked very articulately about this need to bring consumers to bring people into the process of creating things 
and that's what i want to talk about today 
319 
i think something happens i think a head may appear in a second 
we showed them the whole cut and they were all completely what is this 
and the point is when you lie in a hospital bed all day all you do is look at the roof and it's a really shitty experience 
it's a history of invention based around this 
when we actually went and watched this procedure taking place -- and i'll explain this in a second -- it became very obvious that there was a human dimension to this that they really weren't recognizing 
why do we line up the square milk carton with the square fence 
because we kind of have to -- we're just compelled to 
we don't know why but we do 
so what is this i hear you all ask no i don't 
so what seems like a very clunky product is in fact incredibly useful 
these guys are using this very successfully 
how far you can anticipate what follows from it what are the threats what are the possibilities the challenges the opportunities 
and all the components are there which are now in common parlance in our vocabulary you know 30-odd years later wind energy recycling biomass solar cells 
for example if in that bucky-inspired phrase we draw back and we look at planet earth and we take a kind of typical industrialized society then the energy consumed would be split between the buildings 44 percent transport 34 percent and industry 
if you compared detroit with a city of a northern european example -- and munich is not a bad example of that with the greater dependence on walking and cycling -- then a city which is really only twice as dense is only using one-tenth of the energy 
in other words you take these comparable examples and the energy leap is enormous 
how does it affect the design of buildings 
the one example i take is a corporate headquarters for a company called willis and faber in a small market town in the northeast of england commuting distance with london 
this building was wired for change 
in other words we didn't have the technology to do what would be really interesting on that building 
and if i fast-forward in time what is interesting is that the technology is now available and celebratory 
the library of the free university which opened last year is an example of that 
so it's not a kind of sacrifice quite the reverse 
and just to give a sort of glimpse of that technology the ability to plot points in the sky and to transmit to transfer that information now directly into the factory 
for wind tunnels we would literally put them in a wind tunnel and blast air and the many kilometers of cable and so on 
i mean major transformation 
it's been well known that the dead sea is dying 
how do you make them more friendly at that scale 
hong kong i refer to as a kind of analog experience in a digital age because you always have a point of reference 
250 -- excuse me 50000 people working 24 hours seven days 
contagious is a good word 
laughter is contagious passion is contagious 
and that directly increased student wellbeing 
and that can't happen in a classroom 
and ahmedabad got the first child-friendly zebra crossing in the world 
man this program is wonderful 
we have to start collecting from 555 
kbs so the charter of compassion starts right here 
it was incredible 
now i was paid in dollars as a consultant and i looked at my income tax return and tried to ask myself is there a line in my return which shows how much of this income has gone to the people whose knowledge has made it possible 
i tried to convince myself that no no i have worked for the policy changes 
and this was a moment of great pain and trauma because i couldn't live with it any longer 
in fact they invite the honey bees through their colors and the bees don't keep all the honey for themselves 
these are the three guiding principles of the honey bee network that whenever we learn something from people it must be shared with them in their language 
you cannot discriminate 
i'm so sorry to say that 
the rice that you ate in the lunch and you will eat today is transplanted by women bending in a very awkward posture millions of them every season in the paddy season when they transplant paddy with their feet in the water 
and feet in the water will develop fungus infections and that infection pains because then other insects bite that point 
and this is what he got painted 
there could be nothing more wrong than the maslowian model of hierarchy of needs because the poorest people in this country can get enlightenment 
so here's a model where a two-wheeler washing machine  
so it is better it is safer it is affordable it is energy-efficient 
so why are people willing to adjust with that mismatch 
for example cell phones we have 400 million cellphones in this country 
now the eminent model the long-tail model tells you that small sales of a large number of books for example having only a few copies sold can still be a viable model 
look at what he is doing 
but he has modified a two-wheeler so that he can get autonomy and freedom and flexibility 
and we have a very vibrant network in china particularly but also emerging in brazil and other parts of the world 
i can't change the condition of the road but i can make the cycle run faster 
and this is a donkey cart which they modified 
this is in china this girl needed a breathing apparatus 
there's a whole range of innovations that we have 
a car which runs on compressed air with six paisa per kilometer 
and he didn't mean the comfort of a five-course dinner as opposed to a one-course meal but he really meant the comfort of the quality of the building for the people 
so in an indirect way you can see the sun 
and what they did is they created an integral building element to improve the quality of the space that surrounds the visitors of the museum 
they created this shade that you can see here which actually covers the sun but opens up to the good light from the sky 
they allowed themselves a few mistakes along the way 
this is richard kelly who was born 100 years ago which is the reason i bring him up now because it's kind of an anniversary year 
he meant something like this -- where the light gives direction to the space and helps you to get around 
these three distinct elements together make a lighting environment that helps us to feel better 
how do they share their culture 
the problem is though that i wanted to explain to you how this really works -- but i can have four of these on my finger so you would not to be able to really see them 
so just to explain 
why are all these motorways permanently lit 
can we maybe be much more selective and create better environments that also benefit from darkness 
can we engage people more in the lighting projects that we create so they really want to connect with it like here 
where have they come from where are they going 
and it only embodies all these stories and all this suspense because of the darkness and the light 
they pointed out that i believe it was between 30 and 50 years from today they will be steering cars by wire without all that mechanical stuff 
it really was a big idea in technology when we started applying it in the ibot for the disabled community 
the big idea here is i think a new piece of a solution to a fairly big problem in transportation 
for instance in that time 91 percent of america lived either on farms or in small towns 
so the car -- the horseless carriage that replaced the horse and carriage -- was a big deal it went twice as fast as a horse and carriage 
it all made sense with 91 percent of the people living there 
three million people die every year in cities due to bad air and almost all particulate pollution on this planet is produced by transportation devices particularly sitting in cities 
i don't look like a motor vehicle 
we're a recreational vehicle that doesn't really matter and i don't spend my time doing that kind of stuff 
then she looks up she's looking up and she says and i'm 81 years old and i don't drive a car anymore 
we need water 
we figured out how to put a vapor-compression distiller on this thing with a counter-flow heat exchanger to take the waste heat then using a little bit of the electricity control that process and for 450 watts which is a little more than half of its waste heat it will make 10 gallons an hour of distilled water from anything that comes into it to cool it 
so if we put this box on here in a few years could we have a solution to transportation electricity and communication and maybe drinkable water in a sustainable package that weighs 60 pounds 
we tend to do any technology that we think is sufficiently important we'll typically do it twice once we want to do it first 
and then it's time to do it again last year 
after it falls below a critical price it will tend if it's successful to rise above a critical mass a penetration 
and maybe you have reasons for starting to connect them and bring the rest of your entertainment in 
this is a fascinating research from who that shows the effect of generic drugs on anti-retroviral drug compounds and cocktails 
linux is another good example 
two percent isn't 20 percent but in the car business which is slow moving that's huge that's arrival 
free is something that comes with digital because the reproduction costs are essentially free it comes with ip because it's such an efficient protocol it comes with fiber optics because there's so much bandwidth 
it's an economic force it's a technical force 
you know there could be a film's [unclear] there but it's basically every song ever made could be stored on 400 dollars worth of storage by 2008 it takes that entire element the physical element of songs off the table 
because of some of technologies we've been talking about 
and by definition every one of you who is in this room must consider yourself a global soul a global citizen 
even more problematic they're not listening to poor people themselves 
in 2002 i met this incredible entrepreneur named amitabha sadangi from india who'd been working for 20 years with some of the poorest farmers on the planet 
and he was expressing his frustration that the aid market had bypassed low-income farmers altogether despite the fact that 200 million farmers alone in india make under a dollar a day 
but the market also had bypassed low income farmers because these systems were both too expensive and they were constructed for fields that were too large 
in fact when you go back to the beginning there were no private investors who would be willing to take a risk on building a new technology for a market class that made under a dollar a day that were known to be some of the most risk-averse people on the planet and that were working in one of the riskiest sectors agriculture 
secondarily we wanted to see if we could export this drip irrigation and bring it into other countries 
in arusha tanzania a to z textile manufacturing has worked in partnership with us with unicef with the global fund to create a factory that now employs 7000 people mostly women 
so that in the terrorist attacks of november they were the first responder and are now beginning to scale because of partnership 
president obama understands that 
it's not hyperbole to say that these civil society institutions and these social entrepreneurs are building real alternatives to the taliban 
it was about 115 degrees 
and because i wanted to impress you all with slides since i saw the great presentations yesterday with graphs i made a graph that moves and i talk about the makeup of me 
during the hurricane you had msnbc posting about the hurricane on their blog updating it frequently this was possible because of the easy nature of blogging tools 
they sent a search party and i overheard people saying they wish i had killed myself jumped off bible peak 
and i won it i reached all of these people and i had tens of thousands of people reading about my life everyday 
and then i wrote a post about a banjo 
and my husband -- this is my husband who is very hot -- he won an award for being hot --  -- he told me you cannot buy a banjo 
and those people who know me understood my joke 
how much money does he spend on beer in a year 
and then i got people saying leave him 
and why are they reading this 
this is not science but this was enough for me to be really so interested in how we have evolved and how we can trace our line 
this is the only picture i have and to think of what we have the ability to do with our blogs to think about the people who are on those $100 computers talking about who they are sharing these personal stories -- this is an amazing thing 
and -- and so i printed out her -- or i sent a pdf of her blog to her family and they passed it out at her memorial service and even in her obituary they mentioned her blog because it was such a big part of her life 
you can see in its shape and its streamlined design it's powered for ocean swimming 
it flies through the ocean on its pectoral fins gets lift powers its movements with a lunate tail 
this tuna symbolizes what's the problem for all of us in the room 
so take a look at that animal 
so in a program called tag-a-giant we've actually gone from ireland to canada from corsica to spain 
and that's the fisheries off the state of north carolina 
they're coming together that could be tuna sex -- and there it is 
so from data like this we're able now to put the map up and in this map you see thousands of positions generated by this decade and a half of tagging 
salmon sharks go down to the tropics to pup and come into monterey 
we just need to put it together 
we have the technology that's shown us where it is 
hi there i'm hasan i'm an artist 
basically this is the fbi offices in tampa where i spent six months of my life -- back and forth not six months continuously 
or questions such as -- actually during the polygraph which was how it finally ended after nine consecutive of them -- one of the polygraph questions was  
and it's like guys i travel a lot 
don't want to make it look like i'm making any sudden moves 
and so i just kept doing this over and over and over 
then i'd make websites 
so you can see delta 1252 going from kansas city to atlanta 
this was on delta 719 going from jfk to san francisco 
these are the airports that i hang out in because i like airports 
but if you can cross-reference this with the other data then you're basically replaying the roll of the fbi agent and putting it all together 
this is exactly where my old apartment in san francisco was 
and then sometimes you get this 
so there's multiple databases 
so there's different categorizations of meals eaten outside empty train stations empty gas stations 
at 156 pm was this one at 459 pm was this one 
every few moments i shoot the image 
so by me putting all this information out there what i'm basically telling you is i'm telling you everything 
and the reason their information has any value is well because no one else has access to it 
and by me cutting out the middle man and giving it straight to you the information that the fbi has has no value so thus devaluing their currency 
so in a way i'm glad that i'm completely obsolete 
and you know some of my friends have always said hey you're just paranoid why are you doing this 
so you can see that the homeland security likes to come by -- department of homeland security 
bruno giussani hasan just curious 
so it's just become another day 
and everything's automated at the other end 
on the day you are in a place where there is no coverage the fbi gets crazy 
well it goes to the last point that i was at 
hasan thank you very much  
you all know the truth of what i'm going to say 
but first see what a miserable lot we are 
even the people just below the top have less good health than the people at the top 
and there you see it in relation to the measure of inequality i've just shown you which i shall use over and over again in the data 
that's very important in poorer countries but not in the rich developed world 
but in the more equal societies it rises to 60 or 65 percent 
this is violence 
there's a about a tenfold difference there log scale up the side 
but it goes from about 40 to 400 people in prison 
basically it's asking do rich fathers have rich sons and poor fathers have poor sons or is there no relationship between the two 
one is that in graph after graph we find the countries that do worse whatever the outcome seem to be the more unequal ones and the ones that do well seem to be the nordic countries and japan 
it's not just one or two things that go wrong it's most things 
i am not talking about perfect equality i'm talking about what exists in rich developed market democracies 
it also leads to status insecurity 
the big change in our understanding of drivers of chronic health in the rich developed world is how important chronic stress from social sources is affecting the immune system the cardiovascular system 
thank you 
well i didn't have that in mind so  
the acid will ruin the gold plating 
beneath it is a wonderful knife 
no but is it fun 
so i type design emotion and my website wasn't first again 
it's so much fun to drive 
and then a psychologist alice isen did this wonderful experiment 
so she'd bring people into the room and there'd be a string hanging down here and a string hanging down here 
you get a little problem you say ah i'll figure it out 
there's an amazing amount of stuff that's built into the brain 
behavioral is subconscious you're unaware of it 
almost everything we do is subconscious 
and the tea is sitting in this stuff to the right -- the tea is to the right of this line 
and the reason you might buy it now is because you care about the environment 
the other neat thing  
so that's the new me 
the graph was interesting although you need to consider it carefully 
it did not correlate with the size of classrooms 
if you took the same technology and piloted it into one of those remote schools where the score was 30 percent and let's say took that up to 40 percent -- that will be a completely different thing 
the last question is what everybody said but you know i mean they must have poked their head over the wall and asked the people in your office can you show me how to do it and then somebody taught him 
he came there and he started to fiddle around with the touchpad 
i left the computer there with lots of cds -- i didn't have any internet -- and came back three months later 
and as soon as they saw me they said we need a faster processor and a better mouse 
so i said but how did you understand what's going on over there 
so then i measured and they were using 200 english words with each other -- mispronounced but correct usage -- words like exit stop find save that kind of thing not only to do with the computer but in their day-to-day conversations 
this is the himalayas up in the north very cold 
i want to just cut this short we did this over and over again 
so if they have access to the computer they will teach themselves including intelligence 
but we got a clean learning curve almost exactly the same as what you would get in a school 
i'll leave it at that because i mean it sort of says it all doesn't it 
an educational technology and pedagogy that is digital automatic fault-tolerant minimally invasive connected and self-organized 
and it's about rediscovering idealism in all of that wreckage 
i negotiated with saddam's diplomats at the un 
i'd already served in germany norway various other places but i was posted to new york to serve on the un security council for the british delegation 
and there i dealt with things like the middle east peace process the lockerbie issue -- we can talk about that later if you wish -- but above all my responsibility was iraq and its weapons of mass destruction and the sanctions we placed on iraq to oblige it to disarm itself of these weapons 
i decided to take a sabbatical in fact at the new school bruce 
so took a running leap and jumped over the edge of a cliff 
but in a way i've got used to the sensation of it 
a lot of my friends were still in it 
it was anarchy 
and it's a very horrible thing to see anarchy to know that the police and the military -- there were lots of military troops there -- actually can't stop that rampaging mob who's coming down the street 
they were not allowed a foreign office to help them deal with this immensely complicated process which became known as the final status process of kosovo 
and i came to kosovo and advised the kosovo government 
if they can't do it who's left to deal with it 
so we will be bringing darfuri rebel groups the northern cypriots and the southern cypriots rebels from aceh and awful long laundry list of chaotic conflicts around the world 
that is the politics of the 21st century and in a way independent diplomat embodies that fragmentation that change that is happening to all of us 
now today we're not talking about good and bad tv 
this is something that clearly separates us from the animal kingdom 
is television literally functioning as our conscience tempting us and rewarding us at the same time 
we surveyed the top-20 nielsen shows every year for 50 years -- a thousand shows 
viewers had responded dramatically 
this was the first show that allowed viewers to say my god i can comment on how i feel about the vietnam war about the presidency through television 
it can change us 
that's mapped against the red dot unemployment which is a simple bureau of labor department statistic 
we had the bursting of the tech bubble 
i can vote you off the island 
there has not been a decade of television without a definitive dominant tv mom 
maude findlay the epitome of the irreverent 1970s who tackled abortion divorce even menopause on tv 
murphy brown took on a vice president when she took on the idea of single parenthood 
this era's mom bree van de kamp 
so here's the metaphor i'm offering today 
previous to this time i was very selfish and self-righteous 
and on this higher level he becomes loving and forgiving 
but here's the weirdest place of all war 
i passes insensibly into a we my becomes our and individual faith loses its central importance 
now profane is the opposite of sacred 
it just means ordinary or common 
durkheim believed that anything that unites us takes on an air of sacredness 
i'm offering the metaphor of a staircase in the mind 
so here's the million-dollar question for social scientists like me is the staircase a feature of our evolutionary design 
or is it a bug a mistake in the system -- this religious stuff is just something that happens when the wires cross in the brain -- jill has a stroke and she has this religious experience it's just a mistake 
there's a mutation in the gene and one of them mutates to follow a selfish strategy 
it's so big and powerful and efficient that it can take resources from the greens from the defectors the cheaters 
and pretty soon the whole population is actually composed of these new superorganisms 
we're not locked into cooperation the way bees and ants are 
we're bees we busted out of the hive during the enlightenment 
we unleashed earth-changing creativity and generated vast wealth and comfort 
what's missing 
and that gives me hope because people are not purely selfish 
every man is a piece of the continent a part of the main 
thank you 
there was no more space in the house so i went out to the backyard and without any previous building experience and about 3000 dollars and some recycled materials i built this space 
there was enough space and i had control which was very important 
he won the silver medal for ireland in the 1992 olympics and he trains in this space he trains other people 
museum quality 
i had requested slides kind of adamantly up till the -- pretty much last few days but was denied access to a slide projector 
these are a couple of garage doors painted identical situated next to each other 
so here's the first door you know you get the message 
this is for a book by metropolis 
when i first contacted william burroughs about being part of it he said no he said he didn't believe it was the end of print 
and also surprisingly it was done in kind of a cheap metal and it had completely rusted through and water everywhere and spiders 
and i thought you know what were they thinking 
got no way of tracking it so i could be totally wrong 
i don't have the site it's just the piece itself 
i found out that's very true working on this campaign worldwide 
but anyway this is one of the ads i was most pleased with because they were all elaborately art-directed and this one i thought actually felt like the girl was looking at the computer 
in germany they made one small change without checking with me -- nor did they have to because it was done through agencies -- but see if you can tell the difference 
so i understand their logic i totally disagree with it i think it's a very small-minded approach the world is certainly much more global and i certainly think the people of germany could have handled a little black girl sitting in front of a computer though we'll never know 
article on bryan ferry -- just really boring article -- so i set the whole article in dingbat 
it's kind of horsey type but the texture -- the second plane not quite hitting there was something more enticing if that's the right -- it's not the right word -- but in this cover than time or newsweek 
it did not let up 
there were a lot of orphans made this day and here's a dead body being brought out 
this is my desktop 
this is -- i like found art hand lettering's coming back in a big way and i thought this was a great example of both 
but i was asked to give a talk at a conference in sacramento a few years back 
and i remembered seeing this photograph of my father who was a test pilot and he told me that when you signed up to become a test pilot they told you that there was a 40 to 50 percent chance of death on the job 
i've spent the past year thinking about what it really should be about 
before that obviously technology didn't exist but obviously it did 
but it's still very very productive so i'm attempting to say if we take technology's view of the world what does it want 
and i think once we ask that question we have to go back actually to life because obviously if we keep extending the origins of technology far back i think we come back to life at some point 
brian farrell's work is all part of this agenda to try and actually discover all the species on earth 
more and more of the inert matter of the globe is being touched and animated by life 
and the last thing i bring back this nudibranch 
and so the general long-term trends of evolution are roughly these five ubiquity diversity specialization complexity and socialization now i took that and said ok what are the long-term trends in technology 
that we see there's a general hammer and hammers become more and more specific over time 
there's obviously diversity huge numbers of things 
so the major trends in technology evolution actually are the same as in biological evolution the same drives that we see towards ubiquity towards diversity towards socialization towards complexity that is maybe not a big surprise because if we map out say the evolution of armor you can actually follow a sort of an evolutionary-type cladistic tree 
he has one of the world's largest collections -- about 500 of them 
but the most interesting aspect about this is that if you look at those red lines at the bottom those indicate basically a parentage of a type of cornet that was no longer made that does not happen in biology 
and when we take that we take this idea of what culture is doing and add it to what the long-term trajectory -- again in life's evolution -- we find that each case -- each of the major transitions in life -- what they're really about is accelerating and changing the way in which evolution happens 
so all these steps in evolution are increasing basically the evolution of evolvability 
so if you have life hacking -- life means hacking the game of survival -- then evolution is a way to extend the game by changing the rules of the game 
and each time we make a new opportunity place we're allowing a platform to make new ones 
that's what technology wants 
i'm going my gosh i had never seen anything like this in my life 
and you walk up to the front of the tank then you realize that these animals all have different personalities some of them would hold their ground others would slink into the back of the tank and disappear in the rocks and one in particular this amazing animal  
and what i learned in school though was really beneficial 
if you're a wildlife filmmaker and you're going out into the field to film animals especially behavior it helps to have a fundamental background on who these animals are how they work and you know a bit about their behaviors 
so we created a way to find out  and i got my first look at that famous beak in action 
and octopus are they live in all the oceans 
and as you go deeper that lovely blue water you were launched in gives way to darker and darker blue 
and finally it's a rich lavender and after a couple of thousand feet it's ink black 
but we're just going to zip right past this area this area that includes about 95 percent of the living space on our planet and go to the mid-ocean ridge which i think is even more extraordinary 
and the top of this mountain range is splitting apart creating a rift valley 
the surrounding water is just a couple of degrees above freezing 
and this kind of life and death of hydrothermal vent communities is going on every 30 or 40 years all along the ridge 
but encouragingly i've seen just the opposite 
well how it happened is the local community galvanized 
and these problems are so large and global and it's just overwhelming 
my answer to that is don't look at the big overwhelming issues of the world 
and we can make changes to our behavior that will influence and affect the environment like those people changed the health of that bay 
i was afraid of womanhood 
not that i'm not afraid now but i've learned to pretend 
i've learned to be flexible 
back in the '50s and '60s when i was growing up little girls were supposed to be kind and thoughtful and pretty and gentle and soft and we were supposed to fit into roles that were sort of shadowy -- really not quite clear what we were supposed to be 
now my mother was different 
and i just ate it up 
because women are on the ground floor and we know the traditions so well we can bring a different voice to the table 
and then also my family was in chaos and i drew to try to bring my family together --  -- try to bring my family together with laughter 
but i feel blessed to be able to work with them 
two hundred years ago the united states was less than a few percent urbanized 
it's now more than 82 percent 
now listen to this every week for the foreseeable future until 2050 every week more than a million people are being added to our cities 
however cities despite having this negative aspect to them are also the solution 
so we have this kind of dual nature 
that's the quest 
so here's two questions that i have in my head when i think about this problem 
we use them metaphorically -- the dna of a company the metabolism of a city and so on -- is that just bullshit metaphorical bullshit or is there serious substance to it 
and if that is the case how come that it's very hard to kill a city 
you could drop an atom bomb on a city and 30 years later it's surviving 
this is just a tiny range actually it's us mammals we're one of these 
rat that's a rat -- could have been you 
we're all pretty much the same 
and you see you're very familiar with this 
despite the fact that this is the most complex and diverse system in the universe there's an extraordinary simplicity being expressed by this 
so a wonderful thing about all of biology is that it expresses an extraordinary economy of scale 
and you're very familiar with these networks 
and here's the summary of what i'm saying 
heart rates are slower you live longer diffusion of oxygen and resources across membranes is slower etc 
here it is which says that the bigger you are the more you have per capita unlike biology -- higher wages more super-creative people per capita as you get bigger more patents per capita more crime per capita 
see companies they scale 
there it is after some little fluctuations at the beginning when companies are innovating they scale beautifully 
but you notice i've cheated because i've only gone up to '94 
and i put in front of them an authentic experience that allowed them to learn for themselves 
the problem then becomes how do you take seventh- and eighth-graders to a talk about genocide and deal with the subject in a way that is responsible and respectful and they know what to do with it 
i moved there primarily to be part of a learning environment that validated the way that i knew that kids learned and that really wanted to investigate what was possible when you are willing to let go of some of the paradigms of the past of information scarcity when my grandmother was in school and when my father was in school and even when i was in school and to a moment when we have information surplus 
it asked them to create for themselves and it allowed them to fail process learn from 
ask them to go to places to see things for themselves to actually experience the learning to play to inquire 
this is one of my favorite photos because this was taken on tuesday when i asked the students to go to the polls 
there are words that we're truly afraid of 
this was an issue from 2002 that they published with a lot of different articles on the bionic human 
regenerative medicine is what business week put up when they did a story about regenerative medicine not too long ago 
and you can basically see that the richer a country is the older the people are within it 
and why is this a particularly dramatic challenge right now 
in 2010 two workers per retiree in the us 
this is age versus cost of health care 
this video i think gets across the concept that i'm talking about quite dramatically 
the way to do that is to develop a conversation with the body 
in a child before the age of about six months if they lose their fingertip in an accident they'll re-grow their fingertip 
we heard yesterday about the importance of new materials 
i wouldn't be telling you this story if it weren't compelling 
this is a horse the horse is not in pain 
after treatment that's what it looks like 
he chills the dish it changes its properties and he peels it right out of the dish 
it's the coolest stuff 
in this case at the end of the bypass operation you're going to see the stem cells from the patient that were removed at the beginning of the procedure being injected directly into the heart of the patient 
this was a randomized trial 
there go the cells 
here's another example of stem-cell therapy that isn't quite clinical yet but i think very soon will be 
so you could go in you could get your tummy-tuck 
japan is the oldest country on earth in terms of its average age 
in the united states we've had a somewhat different approach 
but there's been no strategic investment to bring all of the necessary things to bear and focus them in a careful way 
and these tedsters are -- you know as innocent as that name sounds -- these are the philanthropists and artists and scientists who sort of shape our world 
and what could i possibly have to say that would be distinguished enough to justify my participation in something like that 
well my characters like the ones in my shows allow me to play with the spaces between those questions 
what i should tell you -- what i should tell you is that they've each prepared their own little ted talks 
well you know she calls herself black -- she's really more like a caramel color if you look at her 
frankly i'm kvelling just to be here with all the luminaries you have attending something like this you know 
so many others you see they're just wonderful 
but anyway i should have started by saying just how lucky i feel 
you know i couldn't have dreamed of such a thing as a young girl 
you know your parents must be very proud 
the point is i'm happy somebody has practical ideas to get us out of this mess 
so happy continued success 
sorry this is such a wonderful opportunity and everything to be here right now 
my name is noraida and i'm just -- i'm so thrilled to be part of like your ted conference that you're doing and everything like that 
actually you could say i grew up in the capital of dominican republic otherwise known as washington heights in new york city 
and i think he's mexican so that's -- honestly that's close enough for me right now so --  i just -- i'm sorry 
okay sorry so anyway what i was trying to say is that i really love ted 
like it's -- i can't get over this right now 
so basically like da bomb -- what dominican-american benevolent organization for mothers and babies does is basically we try to advocate for students who show a lot of academic promise and who also happen to be mothers like me 
i come from a multicultural family 
and we were only 11 years old so it was not appropriate  
although you know it was wonderful 
well i just wanted to quickly say good evening 
but when sarah jones asked me to please come to ted i said well you know first i don't know that you know -- before two years ago you would not find me in front of an audience of people much less like this because i did not like to give speeches because i feel that as an immigrant i do not have good english skills for speaking 
but that's where we had some problems 
the daughter's marriage is very special to the mom 
and i said yes men can be difficult but all women have to get used to that 
so i always teach my kids to respect american ideas but i told my daughter that this is one exception --  -- that she is not gay she is just confused by this american problem 
thank you very very much i love you 
finished university education got a medical degree 1986 
but critical poverty this slide is from a presentation i gave not that long ago gapminderorg tells the story of the gap between africa and the rest of the world in terms of health care 
yes i'm sorry if it upsets some of you but i think you need to see this that's the floor ok 
because it's scary and it's expensive but we need to have it ok 
that's mike mike comes out from mississippi 
see that's one of the problems we have in nigeria and in africa generally 
it looks like all these americans are here and yes one brit and he's not going to do anything -- he thinks he's british actually and he's actually nigerian i just thought about that 
we eventually got it working is the truth but it was one of these even older than the one you saw 
no yes doesn't matter it worked 
and currently we're working on oxygen -- oxygen delivery on-site 
so that's not new what we're doing is applying this technology to it 
these are members of my graduating class 1986 
and finally i get a call last year and then i have to go up after jj abrams 
hollywood gathers around power tables and the valley gathers around power tables 
but i'm actually here today to tell a story 
and what he said was he wasn't so much afraid that he might die but that he hadn't done the things that he wanted to with his life 
but for me personally it was a real change 
i went from living in a house with five guys in palo alto and living off their leftovers to all of a sudden having all kinds of resources 
connecting them together through conferences -- like a ted -- brings so many powerful connections or through the world forum on social entrepreneurship that my foundation does at oxford every year 
so in 2003 i started to make my way around los angeles to talk about the idea of a pro-social media company and i was met with a lot of encouragement 
one of the lines of encouragement that i heard over and over was the streets of hollywood are littered with the carcasses of people like you who think you're going to come to this town and make movies 
one of these films in particular called north country was actually kind of a box office disaster 
and that to me spoke volumes because it's -- the film started about a true-life story about a woman who was harassed sued her employer led to a landmark case that led to the equal opportunity act and the violence against women act and others 
at that point i thought i knew something about global warming 
and we have 10 films in production right now and dozens others in development 
and one thing that i've learned is that there's never one right way to make change 
and i can imagine if we do this the headlines in 10 years might read something like these new aids cases in africa fall to zero us imports its last barrel of oil --  -- israelis and palestinians celebrate 10 years of peaceful coexistence 
and i believe that working together we can make all of these things happen 
the next day all the artists were invited to join mandela in robben island where he was going to give a conference to the world's press standing in front of his former prison cell 
he was wearing a t-shirt like the one i wear now 
i've subsequently become an envoy for scotland and hiv 
i tell her story to everyone because she represents one of millions of hiv/aids orphans 
i think that's fair to say it's almost everyone in the hall 
but now we have this new layer of private sovereignty in cyberspace 
and their decisions about software coding engineering design terms of service all act as a kind of law that shapes what we can and cannot do with our digital lives 
the reality is that even in democratic societies today we do not have good answers for how you balance the need for security and law enforcement on one hand and protection of civil liberties and free speech on the other in our digital networks 
this is a map of social networks worldwide and certainly facebook has conquered much of the world -- which is either a good or a bad thing depending on how you like the way facebook manages its service 
in plain english that means censorship and surveillance of their users 
this has a chilling effect on people's ability to use the internet to hold government accountable 
thank you very much 
comparable in its own very peculiar way to the achievements of microsoft or google 
here are some of those same weightlifters after their 1989 makeover 
and so i resolved to travel around the world examining this global criminal underworld by talking to policemen by talking to victims by talking to consumers of illicit goods and services 
now organized crime in a globalizing world operates in the same way as any other business 
and it is this western desire to consume that is the primary driver of international organized crime 
and as a consequence of this trade britain alone lost eight billion dollars in revenue 
so what were these guys doing with all the money they were making 
well this is where we come to globalization because that was not just the deregulation of global trade 
this one however is in central british columbia where i photographed it 
what they've done is they've shifted their operations 
people don't smoke as much dope or visit prostitutes quite so frequently during a recession 
and so as soon as i saw this drop into my inbox i dispatched it hastily to the recycle bin and spared myself a very nasty infection 
it's such a large conference 
mark serfaas it's pretty cool huh pursuing happiness 
i mean -- no i mean like in the ted sense 
1860 -- am i good 
and my name and it would tell me and i have to tell you right now this is an unadulterated piece of software this is a real internet browser and this is an actual google site and we're going to test it out live today 
am i feeling lucky 
ze frank oh amazing 
needless to say i was able to leave my job 
four years later i still get probably two or three hundred emails a day from people i don't know and it's been an amazing opportunity to kind of get to know different cultures you know 
and that was embarrassing 
so the scribbler is an attempt to create a generative tool 
i mean this is incredible this is an 11-year-old girl -- drew this and submitted it it's just gorgeous 
none of the haikus were written by the same person and in fact no line was -- you know each line is contributed by a different person at a different -- at a different time 
it dances to music lotte reiniger an amazing shadow puppeteer in the '20s that started doing more elaborate things 
chris anderson ladies and gentlemen mr ze frank 
well this is 2009 
so i'm going to talk about it 
we get the geneticists keeping on telling us how extremely closely we are related -- hardly any genes of difference very very closely related 
i'm not talking about airy-fairy stuff about culture or psychology or behavior 
professor tobias came over from south africa and spoke to university college london 
you've believed it through generations 
so that is what they have done now 
aaron filler from harvard said isn't it time we stopped talking about selective pressures 
he kept it to himself for 30 years 
and at that time it became set in stone the aquatic theory should be dumped with the ufos and the yetis as part of the lunatic fringe of science 
i suggested it and people said no no no 
peals of merry laughter 
that crazy woman she's off again she'll say anything won't she 
this has come 'round to be that all those naked pachyderms have aquatic ancestors 
so this is a close connection between nakedness and water 
here you can't find anybody to compare it with because we're the only animal that walks upright on two legs 
there is only one circumstance in which they always all of them walk on two legs and that is when they are wading through water 
david attenborough thinks it's significant as the possible beginning of our bipedalism 
in the whale it's complete no fat inside at all all in blubber outside 
we can speak 
try to imagine a gorilla performing the same maneuver and you can see that compared with gorilla we are halfway to being shaped like a fish 
there is nothing there 
i don't believe it 
there was professor tobias he's come over 
daniel dennett he's come over 
so the third thing that might happen is a very beautiful thing 
i can tell you that in three words 
the textbooks don't mention it 
and it's pretty simple 
everybody's got one -- all of you 
and so when working as an interaction designer or as an artist who deals with participation -- creating things that live on in or around the human form -- it's really a powerful space to work within 
and it is a tool that actually enables one to listen to their own innards 
when i meet a glacier for the very first time what do i do 
do i carve a message in the snow 
but really the most satisfying experience i've had is the act of listening which is what we need in any good relationship 
and just as with the wall how i wanted to be more wall-like with this project i'd actually like to take more a of glacial pace 
so how do you do that 
that doesn't move 
here's my promise to you if you are consistent and do this within three months the elected official will start calling you when that issue comes up and say what do you think 
now when you approach these animals you need to understand there's a dangerous end to them and you also need to approach them with some level of respect and a little bit of wariness 
if you had the right information you would have done the right thing  
if they follow protocol they'll pick up the phone and say hey do you have the original 
and you actually get into the folder that the elected official actually has to read 
so what your letter means i've got to tell you we are all in a party and political officials are the pinatas 
living systems are in constant conversation with the natural world through sets of chemical reactions called metabolism 
and this is the conversion of one group of substances into another either through the production or the absorption of energy 
now that's exactly the kind of process that i'm interested in when we're thinking about sustainable materials 
it is able to move around its environment 
it can follow chemical gradients 
it can undergo complex reactions some of which are happily architectural 
here this is a protocell and it's vigorously shedding this skin 
the protocells can actually move away from the light 
so this is really interesting now we have an architecture that connects a city to the natural world in a very direct and immediate way 
this is a river 
the reasons vary state to state but mostly in the details 
but as more people showed up wanting water the folks who were there first got a little concerned and in 1865 montana passed its first water law 
there's another thing happening around the country which is that companies are starting to get concerned about their water footprint 
so what can they do about this remaining water footprint that can have serious effects on the ecosystem 
he doesn't lose the water right he just chooses to apply that right or some portion of it to the stream instead of to the land 
this guy's measuring the water that this leaves in the stream 
he's by far the happiest man ever measured by science 
compassion is fun 
therefore to create the conditions for global compassion all we have to do is to reframe compassion as something that is fun 
these are leaders who are highly ambitious for the greater good 
and they according to the research make the best business leaders 
and if you look at these qualities in the context of compassion we find that the cognitive and affective components of compassion -- understanding people and empathizing with people -- inhibits tones down what i call the excessive self-obsession that's in us therefore creating the conditions for humility 
this awareness of serving the greater good is very self-inspiring and it creates fertile ground for compassion to grow in 
that's one 
the second ingredient is autonomy 
and this also creates the conditions for compassion in the workplace 
i found this to be true both on the individual level and at a corporate level 
and what i recognized was that there was an incredible window of opportunity for us as a world community to come together and end torture as an investigative tool 
we often think of torture as being political torture or reserved for just the worst but in fact 95 percent of torture today is not for political prisoners 
so it's just a place where there was no rule of law 
in burundi i walked into a prison and it wasn't a 12-year-old boy it was an 8-year-old boy for stealing a mobile phone 
and when i walked up to the prison director i said you've got to let her out 
so the pieces are not only the training of the lawyers but us finding a way to systematically implement early access to counsel because they are the safeguard in the system for people who are being tortured 
but the third and most important thing is that we make a commitment to this 
and the reason that i think that those words are interesting is because those were the same kinds of words that were used for people who decided they would end slavery or end apartheid 
so you know there's bars and by the time that vishna was getting bigger which means what gets bigger your head gets bigger 
so he would come to the first bar the second bar and then the third bar and then really slowly move his head so he could fit through and come back third second first and he would grab my pinkie because what he wanted to do every day is he wanted to go visit 
and i will do the one thing that i can do 
thank you 
we were in queens we were building the big big big big building in midtown so we were in the small small small boondocks 
but it's not only that 
in italy in milan especially contemporary art really doesn't have that much of a place 
they tried to make a toddler's gas mask in such a way that the toddler can be held by the parent because proximity of the body is so important 
instead she said no no work and leisure can be together 
yeah that's particularly gorgeous -- it's the tv dinner of 2001 
i would like instead to talk about how great some designers are 
it's a long story because it started before 2001 and it was called emergency 
so designers sometimes don't do things that are immediately functional but they're functional to our understanding of issues 
this is cindy van den bremen who is a dutch designer that's done this series of capsters 
they range from this fluffy toy that is about hugging you -- because autistic children like to be hugged tight so it has a spring inside -- all the way to this doll with a mirror so the child can see him or herself in the mirror and regain a sense of self 
design really looks upon the whole world and it considers the world in all of its different ranges 
and it was really interesting because i was the last speaker and before me there were people that were really talking about luxury and i didn't want to be a party pooper but at the same time i felt that i had to kind of bring back the discourse to reality 
the rhythm of the sinusoids has changed tremendously just like the rhythm of our life in the past 25 years so i'm not sure anymore what the wavelength is 
but design and science and the possibility of visualizing different scales and therefore really work at the scale of the very small to make it very big and very meaningful 
so africa is a complex continent full of contradictions as you can see 
and i want to tell you that this is my story ok 
and it's the story of many of the africans who are here 
and my father said ok listen 
so we went to the school and because we were nobodies and because we didn't have privilege and because my father didn't have the right last name he was treated like dirt 
but the money ran out 
you don't see the blogger you don't see the harvard-educated lawyer the vibrant person you know 
and you didn't know about the windmill you know 
and i was just moved 
so what is to be done 
and this is an example you know blogging is one way of doing that 
so we need to start getting better 
and going back to the point i was trying to make this is the swahili wikipedia 
swahili is spoken by about 50 million people in east africa 
so that's a start and we've heard of all their other initiatives 
i walked away from a job with one of the top firms in dc covington and burling six figures 
what are they doing 
practically i mean when i was a first-year student in law school my mom's business had collapsed so i was supporting her 
my sister was struggling to get through undergrad 
an example this man changed my life 
i said i want to be a lawyer 
and i'm like because i'm here and it's cheap and you know i kind of like pittsburgh 
i was also building something called the copenhagen wheel which is just a really beautiful beautiful electric bike at a lab at mit called senseable city lab 
this is a place where my friend abhishek sen was interning 
and that's his actual photograph 
she told me that this is how you would typically test for anemia 
but this is not available in parol 
but fundamentally what i believe is that the map behind of me is called basically the map of anemia 
and when i walked in she was already at the table 
and she said i saw your talk live-streamed 
so of course the only thing i could think of to say at that point was yeah me neither 
why did you bring this up have you lost your mind 
and i said i'm just thinking about it a little bit 
and my life did end when that happened 
the first is vulnerability is not weakness 
the majority of people 
i define vulnerability as emotional risk exposure uncertainty 
i am not a natural vulnerability researcher 
so when i became vulnerability ted like an action figure -- like ninja barbie but i'm vulnerability ted -- i thought i'm going to leave that shame stuff behind because i spent six years studying shame before i really started writing and talking about vulnerability 
but in surviving this last year i was reminded of a cardinal rule -- not a research rule but a moral imperative from my upbringing -- you've got to dance with the one who brung ya 
it is to put on some galoshes and walk through and find our way around 
here's why 
i can't wait to tell people this 
the credit goes to the man in the arena whose face is marred with dust and blood and sweat 
that's what life is about about daring greatly about being in the arena 
i know your dad never paid attention even when you made cfo 
shame drives two big tapes -- never good enough and if you can talk it out of that one who do you think you are 
it's uncomfortable but it's adaptive 
i did not interview men for the first four years of my study 
and he said that's convenient 
so i started interviewing men and asking questions 
if you put shame in a petri dish it needs three things to grow exponentially secrecy silence and judgment 
if you put the same amount of shame in a petri dish and douse it with empathy it can't survive 
and i know it's seductive to stand outside the arena because i think i did it my whole life and think to myself i'm going to go in there and kick some ass when i'm bulletproof and when i'm perfect 
we want you to go in 
so what would be better [than] to use the herring gull in its freedom circling and swooping over the sea and [to] use this as a role model 
so maybe we'll try it once -- to fly a smartbird 
we have to turn it go up and go down 
bruno giussani markus i think that we should fly it once more 
i think first it's important for us to recognize what it is to be blind 
today we're reaching not even 10 percent of them 
he had to mortgage all his life savings to make a bank loan 
it is ourselves we are healing 
this helped us build a very ethical and very highly patient-centric organization and systems that support it 
so what is in this video is a surgeon operating and then you see on the other side another patient is getting ready 
and of course one needs the mindset to be wanting to give away what you have as a surplus 
and what we did was a couple of very counter-intuitive things 
and then over time we were able to bring down the cost significantly to about two percent of what it used to be when we started out 
so we're really comparing apples to apples 
so i want to end my talk leaving this thought and challenge to you 
dr v when you grow in spiritual consciousness we identify with all that is in the world so there is no exploitation 
so the question is how do we get the stuff over from the digital into the physical 
let me show you the weight-shifting mobile 
now mass is the first thing the second thing that's shape 
again it's a mobile phone-shaped box and this one can change its shape 
as humans we are social we are empathic and that's great 
so that's very intuitive and that's what we want 
the brown administration and a bunch of my friends basically leveled the energy efficiency of california so it's the same now 30 years later even though our economy has gone up 80 percent per capita 
the dominant demographic event of our time is this screamingly rapid urbanization that we have going on 
it's interesting because history is driven to a large degree by the size of cities 
people are following opportunity into town 
it is not the case that slums undermine prosperity not the working slums they help create prosperity 
these people are valuable as a group 
you look at that lane on the right 
they're doing it through an outlaw thing the informal economy 
and young people in brand new cities they're inventing doing new things in the south 
climate is a profoundly complex nonlinear system full of runaway positive feedbacks hidden thresholds and irrevocable tipping points 
we're going to keep being surprised and almost all the surprises are going to be bad ones 
if all of the electricity you used in your lifetime was nuclear the amount of waste that would be added up would fit in a coke can 
it's interesting say to take a 25-megawatt 25 million watts and you compare it to the standard big iron of an ordinary westinghouse or ariva which is 12 16 billion watts 
these things are way smaller they're much more adaptable 
this is a list of them 
and as those events keep happening we're going to say okay what can we do about that really 
here is an example that climatologists like a lot one of the dozens of geoengineering ideas 
now this shouldn't come as a surprise to us 
as with bp the hole does get plugged at least temporarily but not before exacting a tremendous price 
now both of these options -- the boy genius and the scammer -- are going to make you vastly overconfident and therefore more prone to taking even bigger risks in the future 
the gulf of mexico is a very big ocean 
in other words the ocean is big she can take it 
a new bubble will replace the old one 
now looking at these images it's difficult to grasp the scale of this operation which can already be seen from space and could grow to an area the size of england 
an escape hatch has been reached 
ok dh oh all right 
i'm now pushing my luck i'm skipping right to six cups 
also three with his left 
oh it's time for richard's help  
excuse me could we work on the design of the microphone 
wow you've been working out 
ok here we go 
there you go 
first one 
what happened there 
do you want me to hold you or not dh don't hold me that hard 
just do it juggler boys you say 
even the pencil 
will someone please throw a small farm animal up onto the stage 
where's gloria  
yeah a little sketchy 
what do you want me to do with it 
nice 
oh barry is there nothing you can't do 
you are my hero you're my jim shea jr 
i do i do 
please please stay seated stay seated thank you 
thank you very much 
i have a big impact on the planet to travel here by plane 
one billion people have not enough to eat 
palm tree plantation in borneo 
i always show my pictures in the street 
man the most beautiful thing that has happened to me in life 
woman love love is nice if you can have it 
eighth man i had a big laugh today 
ninth man you see family is  it's awful 
my family  what can i say 
if someday i can achieve something i would like to say thank you daddy and mommy 
if i do like you i give you one cow and many other things and we become friends 
yab you can also go to the website answer -- respond to the questions also 
now i am going to speak to you about my movie 
video this earth is four and a half billion years old 
there is no business on this movie 
merci beaucoup i love you 
well we have a whole or team general anesthesia nurses and another doctor across from me 
there will be two passes here in the same patient from the same hole 
this was done under local anesthesia as an outpatient 
in the last decade there's been an explosion of use of bone marrow stem cells to treat the patient's other diseases such as heart disease vascular disease orthopedics tissue engineering even in neurology to treat parkinson's and diabetes 
we've just come out we're commercializing this year generation 20 of the marrow miner 
that was all done on a machine that looks like this 
so now what we do is we take a genome we make maybe 50 copies of it we cut all those copies up into little 50-base reads and then we sequence them massively parallel 
and he sequenced he took skin cells healthy skin and cancerous bone marrow and he sequenced the whole genomes of both of them in a couple of weeks no big deal 
and so they were given l-dopa and their symptoms did improve but they weren't totally asymptomatic 
and so what he did was he got his kids sequenced 
thankfully i was able to answer a and i say that honestly in case my life insurance agent is listening 
not hard to imagine my company has software that does this right now 
it can be summed up in a single sentence everything that can happen does 
and things can happen only if these interactions are perfectly balanced 
all of these matter particles come in left- and right-handed varieties and have anti-particle partners that carry opposite charges 
these matter particles all interact with the various force particles 
the most important thing to understand here is that there's a different kind of charge associated with each of these forces 
a particle that hasn't been seen yet but we're pretty sure exists is the higgs particle which gives masses to all these other particles 
and it seems strange that nature would have so many elementary particles 
the most familiar charge is electric charge 
now it turns out the electric charge is actually a combination of two other charges hypercharge and weak charge 
for example this weak force particle and its anti-particle can be created in a collision 
one of the weak particles could decay into an electron and an anti-neutrino and these three still add to zero total charge 
so there's an old idea in particle physics that this known pattern of charges which is not very symmetric could emerge from a more perfect pattern that gets broken -- similar to how the higgs particle breaks the electroweak pattern to give electromagnetism 
this particular choice corresponds to a grand unified theory introduced by pati and salam in 1973 
the larger pattern allows us to predict the existence of particles that have never been seen 
these particles are not uniquely identified by their six charges 
each point in this pattern corresponds to a symmetry of this very complex and beautiful shape 
and this idea that nature is described by mathematics is not at all new 
in 1623 galileo wrote this nature's grand book which stands continually open to our gaze is written in the language of mathematics 
and of course bad for me personally 
in this regard new physics theories are a lot like start-up companies 
as with any large investment it can be emotionally difficult to abandon a line of research when it isn't working out 
i try to balance my life equally between physics love and surfing -- my own three charge directions 
and that shape has remarkable similarities -- and the way it fits into this e8 pattern could be the rest of the picture 
they are more like us than any other living creature and we've heard about that during this ted conference 
chimpanzees i believe more than any other living creature have helped us to understand that after all there is no sharp line between humans and the rest of the animal kingdom 
there isn't time to go into it but it's including things like tree nurseries methods of farming most suitable to this now very degraded almost desert-like land up in these mountains 
ways of reclaiming overused farmland so that within two years they can again be productive 
perhaps build some schoolrooms 
and we've got as is the case around the world about 95 percent of all loans returned 
and as a result of this program something's happening for conservation 
what's happening for conservation is that the farmers living in these 24 villages instead of looking on us as a bunch of white people coming to study a whole bunch of monkeys -- and by the way many of the staff are now tanzanian -- but when we began the tacare program it was a tanzanian team going into the villages 
and everywhere there were these terrible problems 
and you know the kind i'm talking about i'm talking about pollution 
the water -- water is perhaps one of the most crucial issues that we're going to face in this century -- and everywhere water is being polluted by agricultural industrial and household chemicals that still are being sprayed around the world seemingly with the inability to profit from past experience 
in many parts of sub-saharan africa the droughts are so much worse 
well do you think there could be some kind of disconnect between this extraordinarily clever brain the kind of brain that the ted technologies exemplify and the human heart talking about it in the non-scientific term in terms of love and compassion is there some disconnect 
we have compromised their future 
hundreds and thousands of young people around the world can break through and can make this a better world for all living things 
one of their projects will be to help animals -- not just wildlife domestic animals as well 
you can't come to a conference like ted and not have hope can you 
and i mean think of the technologies 
how many of us have children or grandchildren nieces nephews 
people like this are so inspirational 
and i hope that some of us can get together and talk about some of these things especially the roots and shoots program 
and it was very very exciting for me to meet her and see just one example of how young people when they are empowered given the opportunity to take action to make the world a better place truly are our hope for tomorrow 
but other than letting some of you live out your fantasy of looking as cool as tom cruise in minority report the reason why we're really excited about this device is that it really can act as one of these sixth-sense devices that gives you relevant information about whatever is in front of you 
you can get video annotations of the event that you're reading about you can get the latest sports scores etc 
i then in the last few years learned about the pacific garbage patch and the gyre 
and the bigger picture is we need to find a way to turn off the faucet 
it's not just that gyre of plastic that i'm concerned about -- it's the gyre of plastic in the supermarket 
you put something in a bin and you don't have to think about it again 
and i'm sure you'll feel that it's from a safe source 
but what if it wasn't 
the smallest bacteria is about 200 nanometers 
but i got to thinking you know if we were in the middle of a flood zone in bangladesh the water wouldn't look like this 
there we go mind the electrics 
pop the cartridge out pop a new one in 
about half a cent a day to run 
to put that into context the uk government spends about 12 billion pounds a year on foreign aid 
phyllis rodriguez we are here today because of the fact that we have what most people consider an unusual friendship 
and yet it feels natural to us now 
and when i saw it -- and yet through the shock the terrible shock and the terrible explosion in our lives literally we were not vengeful 
i am the mother of zacarias moussaoui 
my son i don't know where he is 
so that's why i decided to tell my story so that my suffering is something positive for other women 
we must be hand-in-hand and do something together 
so if i can save one of the young girls and avoid that they get married and suffer as much as i did well this is something good 
i would like to say that i have learned so much from aicha starting with that day we had our very first meeting with other family members -- which was a very private meeting with security because it was november 2002 and frankly we were afraid of the super-patriotism of that time in the country -- those of us family members 
why did we want to meet her 
and what happened then is we all told our stories and we all connected as human beings 
i never had met someone with such a hard life from such a totally different culture and environment from my own 
and these are always periods ladies and gentlemen accompanied by turbulence and all too often by blood 
for power is not just moving laterally from nation to nation 
it's also moving vertically 
my guess is for what it's worth is that the united states will remain the most powerful nation on earth for the next 10 years 15 but the context in which she holds her power has now radically altered it has radically changed 
but that's not a usual case in history 
a fixed polarity of power means fixed alliances 
canning the great british foreign secretary once said britain has a common interest but no common allies 
at that time the defense of my country was about one thing and one thing only how strong was our army how strong was our air force how strong was our navy and how strong were our allies 
but now one final thing 
collective security is not enough 
peace has come to northern ireland because both sides realized that the zero-sum game couldn't work 
and so suddenly ladies and gentlemen what has been the proposition of visionaries and poets down the ages becomes something we have to take seriously as a matter of public policy 
i started with a poem i'll end with one 
for john donne a recommendation of morality 
but if you ask the average american what the optimal formula of longevity is they probably couldn't tell you 
you have the usda food pyramid 
false 
it reminds me of my college days 
so to make it to age 100 you not only have to have had a very good lifestyle you also have to have won the genetic lottery 
that's why a 65-year-old person is aging at a rate of about 125 times faster than a 12-year-old person 
and research shows that they would be years largely free of chronic disease heart disease cancer and diabetes 
but the real secret i think lies more in the way that they organize their society 
just look at the advertisements 
one fifth the rate of colon and breast cancer big killers here in america 
we're down to one and half right now 
this particular moai these five ladies have been together for 97 years 
and then one day boom we retire 
but they influence each other in profound and measurable ways 
they don't have any conveniences 
that burns calories just as much as going on the treadmill does 
they know how to set up their life in the right way so they have the right outlook 
you know the two most dangerous years in your life are the year you're born because of infant mortality and the year you retire 
and they have strategies to keep from overeating little things that nudge them away from the table at the right time 
and then the foundation of all this is how they connect 
diets don't work no diet in the history of the world has ever worked for more than two percent of the population 
so when i had the chance to give the world's expert in gravity the experience of zero gravity it was incredible 
you can get eight 10 minutes of weightlessness -- how nasa's trained their astronauts for so long 
and you can actually roll some of the pictures now because i don't want to look at me on the screen 
it's almost like that old recipe for chicken soup where you boil the chicken until the flavor is just gone 
these micro-machines which are the envy of nanotechnologists the world over are self-directed powerful precise accurate devices that are made out of strings of amino acids 
and so what i'm going to show you is a three-minute reader's digest version of the first aspect of this film that we produced it's an ongoing project that's going to go another four or five years 
and each of us has about 100000 of these things running around right now inside each one of your 100 trillion cells 
so no matter how lazy you feel you're not really intrinsically doing nothing 
and three years ago one of the things i learned how to do was to become invisible 
i didn't always succeed 
a friend told me shortly after that that she had heard that tim russert a nationally renowned journalist had been talking about me on national tv 
in my country that was the case in 1974 
the women said we agree we'll use pills but we need a doctor to prescribe the pills and we had very very few doctors 
wherever there were people -- and you can see boats with the women selling things -- here's the floating market selling bananas and crabs and also contraceptives -- wherever you find people you'll find contraceptives in thailand 
we introduced our first microcredit program in 1975 and the women who organized it said we only want to lend to women who practice family planning 
it's a part of the village development bank it's not a real bank but it's a fund -- microcredit 
and then we thought we'd help america because america's been helping everyone whether they want help or not 
i said don't worry come over and i'll do the whole lot of you 
and what happened 
then aids came along and hit thailand and we had to stop doing a lot of good things to fight aids 
but unfortunately the government was in denial denial denial 
and he said mechai could you come and join 
he became the chairman of the national aids committee and increased the budget fifty-fold 
and then we gave condoms out everywhere on the streets -- everywhere everywhere 
and then this is the picture i mentioned to you -- the weapon of mass protection 
we all need to help 
and before you can borrow the money you need to be trained 
otherwise they'll never get out of poverty 
and it's a center a focal point for economic and social development 
so we have now found the weapon of mass protection 
in the last 20 years i have published a few books but i have lived in anonymity until february of 2006 when i carried the olympic flag in the winter olympics in italy 
that made me a celebrity now people recognize me in macy's and my grandchildren think that i'm cool 
my measurements 
those athletes had sacrificed everything to compete in the games 
when asked in a tv interview how could she look so good 
sophia loren was right in front of me -- she's a foot taller than i am not counting the poofy hair 
somehow she manages to keep her seven children alive and a few months later she gives birth to premature twins 
somehow the family survives for 16 months and then by extraordinary luck and the passionate heart of a young american man sasha chanoff who manages to put her in a us rescue plane rose mapendo and her nine children end up in phoenix arizona where they're now living and thriving 
once when my daughter paula was in her twenties she said to me that feminism was dated that i should move on 
yes for privileged women like my daughter and all of us here today but not for most of our sisters in the rest of the world who are still forced into premature marriage prostitution forced labor -- they have children that they don't want or they cannot feed 
the place is a small women's clinic in a village in bangladesh 
she's not licensed for that she has never done it 
the woman's face looks like a watermelon 
it is so swollen that you can't even see the eyes 
jenny is horrified at what she has done but then the translator explains that the patient's condition has nothing to do with the operation 
they are paid less than men for the same work if they're paid at all and they remain vulnerable because they have no economic independence and they are constantly threatened by exploitation violence and abuse 
in any war today most of the casualties are civilians mainly women and children they are collateral damage 
i'm talking about men with young minds of course 
six billion hungry carnivores to feed by 2050 
and when you think that 80 percent of global trade in food now is controlled by just five multinational corporations it's a grim picture 
so the grain markets were to the south of the city 
but also you have to imagine it full of food 
and if we look at an image of smithfield in 1830 you can see that it would have been very difficult to live in a city like this and be unaware of where your food came from 
it even got built but nothing to do with this vision that howard had 
so i've come up with an alternative which is sitopia from the ancient greek sitos for food and topos for place 
i believe we already live in sitopia 
so if we were to do that what might sitopia look like 
because without these kinds of people we can't have places like this 
and equally important is the negative version -- don't do to others what you would not like them to do to you 
i sometimes see when i'm speaking to a congregation of religious people a sort of mutinous expression crossing their faces because people often want to be right instead 
and so we have a choice it seems to me 
and also see that it demands acute intelligence not just a gooey feeling 
in this room all this expertise if we joined it all together we could change the world 
who knew about extension managers 
now why would i care about rome particularly 
these are just drawings of rome i get back as often as possible -- i need to 
these are sketches of some of the little details 
here's a little map and i thought of maps at the beginning maybe i should just try and do a little atlas of my favorite streets and connections in rome 
over the spanish steps we go 
she parks her dirigible lowers the anchor rope and climbs down for a closer look inside 
the text here is right side and upside down so that you are forced to turn the book around and you can see it from ground point of view and from her point of view -- looking in the hole getting a different kind of perspective moving you around the space particularly appropriate in a building that can contain perfectly a sphere dimensions of the diameter being the same as the distance from the center of the floor to the center of the oculus 
everything he sees from this point on is slightly affected by the linguine but keeps on moving because this guy's got a job to do 
then i thought wait a minute what am i doing 
if i do a foldout page on the left-hand side and let you just unfold it you see behind it what i mean by scar tissue 
pigeon's progress struck me as a catchy title 
you can see the tombs and pines and so on and so forth along the way 
this is something that's a little bit unusual 
this is one of those things i show to my students because it's a complete bastardization -- a denial of any rules of perspective 
i have all the pieces there's santa maria della pace there's a soccer ball there's a little bit of a bird's wing -- nothing's happening so i had to rethink it 
thank you very much 
so there's something super interesting about natural systems 
the first two are the macrobot and decibot 
one of them is the input from the user as you're building your bricks 
so each chain or each element wants to turn right or left 
you're telling each unit if it should turn right or left 
so you can basically program any three-dimensional shape -- or one-dimensional two-dimensional -- up into this chain completely passively 
at the end of the lecture they asked a number of questions but there was one that's really stuck with me since then 
and he reached the point where he felt that there must be something out there that was smaller than the smallest forms of life that were ever known -- bacteria at the time 
as we started to look at this information we would see that about 20 percent of the genetic information in your nose doesn't match anything that we've ever seen before -- no plant animal fungus virus or bacteria 
so can we have the lights off please so we can see it 
well not quite not quite perfect -- you see in intergalactic space -- intergalactic space is completely dark pitch dark 
that's how big and how dark the universe is 
and that is how un-typical this place is 
now that is knowledge and if that weren't amazing enough the faithfulness with which the one structure resembles the other is increasing with time that is the growth of knowledge 
now how does the solar system -- and our environment in the form of us -- acquire this special relationship with the rest of the universe 
well one thing that's true about stephen hawking's remark -- i mean it is true but it's the wrong emphasis  one thing that's true about it is that it doesn't do it with any special physics there's no special dispensation no miracles involved it does it simply with three things that we have here in abundance 
one of them is matter because the growth of knowledge is a form of information processing information processing is computation computation requires a computer -- there's no known way of making a computer without matter 
and the same -- well if we could do that we'd automatically have an energy supply because the transmutation would be a fusion reactor -- and evidence 
and with a more powerful telescope you'll be able to see stars and planets 
and locally there you could build particle accelerators and learn elementary particle physics and chemistry and so on 
the danger is not at all unprecedented species go extinct all the time 
and it's true that an ounce of prevention equals a pound of cure but that's only if we know what to prevent 
the world is buzzing at the moment with plans to force reductions in gas emissions at all costs 
they're not central to the human effort to face this problem or problems in general 
and that is i understand that optimists greatly outlive pessimists 
it's only 10 years ago this month when we published the first sequence of a free-living organism that of haemophilus influenzae 
we can now do that same genome project in the order of two to eight hours 
and we started the sorcerer ii expedition where we were as with great oceanographic expeditions trying to sample the ocean every 200 miles 
and with doing this we've made some amazing discoveries 
i view that these genes are now not only the design components of evolution 
transposons are just small pieces of dna that randomly insert in the genetic code 
we found that synthesizing accurate dna in large pieces was extremely difficult 
and there's only two countries the us and the former soviet union that had major efforts on trying to create biological warfare agents 
i think future engineered species could be the source of food hopefully a source of energy environmental remediation and perhaps replacing the petrochemical industry 
it was actually a very strange study because the various religious leaders were using their scriptures as law books and they couldn't find anything in them prohibiting making life so it must be ok the only ultimate concerns were biological warfare aspects of this but gave us the go ahead to start these experiments for the reasons we were doing them 
it poses a very fascinating puzzle for us 
in particular check out asia 
zoom in on haiti in outline here 
but deng xiaoping instinctively understood the importance of offering choices to his people 
demonstrated successes there led to a consensus for a move toward the market model for the entire economy 
we can go do it over and over again 
we also need the choices for people 
the final thing we need are choices for leaders 
now when i say that some of you are starting to think well is this just bringing back colonialism 
let us have a hong kong nearby 
some of my citizens will move into that city as well 
many of them totally get the notion of a special zone that people can opt into as a rule 
so let me show you why that's wrong 
take this representation of all of the land 
their kids can get an education 
so what will it take to get started building the first charter cities scaling this so we build many more 
let's have a system where we have ownership of land that is registered in a government office that people can pledge as collateral 
15 seconds studio 
philip zimbardo let's tune into the conversation of the principals in adam's temptation 
come on adam don't be so wishy-washy take a bite i did 
i don't want to get in trouble 
life is temptation it's all about yielding resisting yes no now later impulsive reflective present focus and future focus 
what determines any decision you make 
you can focus on past-positive or past-negative 
and moderate on present-hedonism 
they sacrifice family time they sacrifice friend time 
i'm sure that resonates with some of the tedsters 
told me don't eat that marshmallow because if you wait you're going to get two of them until i learned to balance out 
and of all the places in the solar system that we might go to and search for answers to questions like this there's saturn and we have been to saturn before -- we visited saturn in the early 1980s -- but our investigations of saturn have become far more in-depth in detail since the cassini spacecraft traveling across interplanetary space for seven years glided into orbit around saturn in the summer of 2004 and became at that point the farthest robotic outpost that humanity had ever established around the sun 
in fact just studying the rings alone we stand to learn a lot about the discs of stars and gas that we call the spiral galaxies 
and these molecules high up in the atmosphere of titan get broken down and their products join together to make haze particles 
try to imagine what the surface of titan might look like 
it's cold it's eerie it's misty it might be raining and you might be standing on the shores of lake michigan brimming with paint thinner  
as i said it has a thick extensive atmosphere 
we have instruments on cassini which can see down to the surface through this atmosphere and my camera system is one of them 
they look like they've been pulled apart 
so it was -- i mean i'm getting goose bumps just talking about it 
but this is somewhat of a shoreline 
and obviously it landed in one of these flat dark regions and it didn't sink out of sight so it wasn't fluid that we landed in 
and it's probably the case that this material has washed off the highlands of titan through these channels that we saw and has drained over billions of years to fill in low-lying basins 
and i think you would agree that we have found titan is a remarkable mystical place it's exotic it's alien but yet strangely earth-like and having earth-like geological formations and a tremendous geographical diversity and is a fascinating world whose only rival in the solar system for complexity and richness is the earth itself 
it is a very geologically active body 
or this 
really 
we're having trouble feeding six billion today 
when we look at a map of los angeles or london it is hard to believe that as of 2005 only 15 percent of the world was mapped to a geo-codable level of detail 
at google 40 volunteers used a new software to map 120000 kilometers of roads 3000 hospitals logistics and relief points 
nobel prize nominee hernando de soto recognized that the key to economic liftoff for most developing countries is to tap the vast amounts of uncapitalized land 
welcome to the new world 
when i travel with my work across europe and the united states one question always comes up where is the palestinian gandhi 
israeli soldier a nonviolent protest is not going to stop the [unclear] 
julia bacha when i first heard about the story of budrus i was surprised that the international media had failed to cover the extraordinary set of events that happened seven years ago in 2003 
they had been using nonviolence for about two years but had grown disenchanted since nobody was paying attention 
a week later they held the most well-attended and disciplined demonstration to date 
so the human brain has about a hundred billion neurons in it 
so beyond spatial memory if we look for this grid-like firing pattern throughout the whole brain we see it in a whole series of locations which are always active when we do all kinds of autobiographical memory tasks like remembering the last time you went to a wedding for example 
or better how do you explain when others are able to achieve things that seem to defy all of the assumptions 
why how what 
we say what we do we say how we're different or how we're better and we expect some sort of a behavior a purchase a vote something like that 
all i did was reverse the order of the information 
in other words when we communicate from the outside in yes people can understand vast amounts of complicated information like features and benefits and facts and figures 
when we can communicate from the inside out we're talking directly to the part of the brain that controls behavior and then we allow people to rationalize it with the tangible things we say and do 
and samuel pierpont langley had what we assume to be the recipe for success 
the next 34 percent are your early majority your late majority and your laggards 
the problem is how do you find the ones that get it before you're doing business with them versus the ones who don't get it 
people don't buy what you do they buy why you do it and what you do simply proves what you believe 
they were extremely well-funded 
in the summer of 1963 250000 people showed up on the mall in washington to hear dr king speak 
because there are leaders and there are those who lead
