and so i applied to caltech and they turned me down .PERIOD <BREAK>
but i felt out of control of my life .PERIOD <BREAK>
now ,COMMA eventually ,COMMA one did .PERIOD under the conditions of anonymity ,COMMA they said they would be happy to do this test for us -- so anonymity ,COMMA and <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> dollars per seat that we crashed .PERIOD <BREAK>
there's a beautiful statement on the screen that says ,COMMA light creates ambiance ,COMMA light makes the feel of a space ,COMMA and light is also the expression of structure .PERIOD <BREAK>
and when we do and it swims ,COMMA we see this magnificent bathymetry that the shark knows is there on its path as it goes from california to hawaii .PERIOD <BREAK>

i wanted to know about their seasonality ,COMMA what time of year ,COMMA this is when they first arrive ,COMMA but how long are they around for ?QUESTIONMARK does that give any clues ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
it makes it more organic ,COMMA more natural .PERIOD <BREAK>

if you just multiply by <NUM> million people ,COMMA let's say losing one day a month ,COMMA whatever ,COMMA and you see a vast amount of resource wasted .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA i think in the next <NUM> years ,COMMA if we can get rid of all of the traditional approaches to artificial intelligence ,COMMA like neural nets and genetic algorithms and rule-based systems ,COMMA and just turn our sights a little bit higher to say ,COMMA can we make a system that can use all those things for the right kind of problem ?QUESTIONMARK some problems are good for neural nets ;SEMICOLON we know that others ,COMMA neural nets are hopeless on them .PERIOD <BREAK>
oh ,COMMA but it doesn't matter .PERIOD <BREAK>
and you should see the faces of these people when they realize that those assisting them are like them .PERIOD <BREAK>
so i get two sources .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is a new way to type ,COMMA on my old ,COMMA color classic .PERIOD <BREAK>
beauty ?QUESTIONMARK i don't think i know what beauty is .PERIOD <BREAK>
there are also ,COMMA i think ,COMMA increasing results from the scientific study of humans that ,COMMA indeed ,COMMA we're not born blank slates .PERIOD <BREAK>

when i was a kid ,COMMA no one wore a seat belt .PERIOD <BREAK>
so our research -- and i think the research also at the universities -- are now fixing on these points to say :COLON how can we actually -- and this might sound trivial now to you -- how can we change cooking ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>

over <NUM> percent of the deaths were from respiratory illnesses -- again ,COMMA all preventable and treatable .PERIOD <BREAK>
the second is giving extra money to people who get their master's degree .PERIOD <BREAK>

so we're going along with this .PERIOD and here's ,COMMA just to give you the pattern .PERIOD <BREAK>
this instrument pretty much saved my life .PERIOD <BREAK>
and because they used my own cells to build this bladder ,COMMA it's going to be with me .PERIOD <BREAK>
my time is nearly up .PERIOD <BREAK>
so now ,COMMA what's great about these free-stylers ,COMMA they will get cued different words .PERIOD <BREAK>
i mean ,COMMA like any sort of growing startup organization ,COMMA we are sort of overwhelmed by our growth ,COMMA and that means we're getting enormous quantity of whistleblower disclosures of a very high caliber but don't have enough people to actually process and vet this information .PERIOD <BREAK>
there is a reflex called the lazarus reflex .PERIOD <BREAK>
and they belong on the sidewalks ,COMMA and they'll use it seriously .PERIOD <BREAK>
well ,COMMA i said i'd talk about two windows on human nature -- the cognitive machinery with which we conceptualize the world ,COMMA and now i'm going to say a few words about the relationship types that govern human social interaction ,COMMA again ,COMMA as reflected in language .PERIOD <BREAK>
but it also brought home to me the lessons which erik erikson had tried to instill in all of us about the importance of finding balance in life .PERIOD <BREAK>
and that ,COMMA to me ,COMMA that personal experience was the first time in my life that the mindset i grew up with was changed .PERIOD <BREAK>
so that's not the most fun part of this research ,COMMA although it's interesting .PERIOD <BREAK>
not stamps ,COMMA but one day .PERIOD <BREAK>
harmony is the notes that mozart didn't give you ,COMMA but somehow the contradiction of his notes suggest that .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's called the appointment dynamic .PERIOD <BREAK>
i heard the word carcinoma .PERIOD <BREAK>

he looked at the odds of another world war ,COMMA of a massive volcanic eruption ,COMMA even of an asteroid hitting the earth .PERIOD <BREAK>

now as seductive as the idea of control sounds ,COMMA it's a false premise .PERIOD <BREAK>
and then ,COMMA the rest of their life ,COMMA they will do that three or four hours a day .PERIOD <BREAK>
so in this case ,COMMA sal's looking at two tags there ,COMMA and there they are :COLON the white sharks of california going off to the white shark cafe and coming back .PERIOD <BREAK>

and they could be extinct in less than <NUM> years ,COMMA if we don't do something now to protect them .PERIOD <BREAK>

you can't fight it ,COMMA so embrace it and find a way to work with it .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA my next -- the next thing i was trying to get was copper .PERIOD <BREAK>
so i have to work with a supply chain ,COMMA and i've got to work with the technologies ,COMMA and i've got to work with everything else all the time ,COMMA and so compromises start to fit into it .PERIOD <BREAK>
it makes perfect sense .PERIOD <BREAK>
now that journey ,COMMA and what took me from essex all the way across the world -- by the way ,COMMA we were laughing at democratic activists .PERIOD <BREAK>
they can run up a surface at a meter per second ,COMMA take <NUM> steps in that one second -- you can hardly see them .PERIOD <BREAK>

a wise person knows how to improvise ,COMMA as luke did when he re-washed the floor .PERIOD <BREAK>
that scene sounds like science fiction ,COMMA but is battlefield reality already .PERIOD <BREAK>
maybe their greater ability to cooperate and adapt ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
incomes at that time less than $ <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> per year .PERIOD <BREAK>
if the goal is to build states that can credibly take care of themselves -- and i'm putting that proposition equally ;SEMICOLON you know i'm very harsh on my counterparts -- aid must end in each country in a definable period .PERIOD <BREAK>
but if you think a whole lot of other things matter that lead up to well being -- things like your family relationships ,COMMA friendship ,COMMA community ,COMMA values -- then ,COMMA actually ,COMMA this is an incredibly exciting time to be in politics .PERIOD <BREAK>
we brought these guys together and we started to try and solve this .PERIOD <BREAK>
so that's where we get our nitrogen from .PERIOD <BREAK>
and if you zoom in a bit you can see that all of this area is divided into strips that go over different types of soil ,COMMA and we were actually monitoring ,COMMA measuring every single tree in these <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> hectares ,COMMA <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> acres .PERIOD <BREAK>
or paul baran ,COMMA and his vision for packet switching .PERIOD <BREAK>
and all those phones were in the few urban places .PERIOD <BREAK>
california is basically the equivalent of europe ,COMMA in this .PERIOD <BREAK>

he risked his life as he walked up to people whose families he'd murdered .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so took this first example ,COMMA which is called coxsackievirus ,COMMA and just break it into small windows .PERIOD <BREAK>
there's a whole lot better technology coming ,COMMA and that's part of the change in medicine .PERIOD <BREAK>
now this other line of evidence is a really interesting one .PERIOD <BREAK>
or it could take a fly and put legs where its antennae should be .PERIOD <BREAK>
so we went to the ordinary people that you saw .PERIOD <BREAK>
and she died quietly in her favorite place .PERIOD <BREAK>
really ,COMMA they were actually against it .PERIOD <BREAK>
so that today ,COMMA the people living outside africa have about two and a half percent of their dna from neanderthals .PERIOD <BREAK>

and once you can do that ,COMMA you create the kind of self-knowledge that enables self-mastery .PERIOD <BREAK>
everyone needs certainty that they can avoid pain and at least be comfortable .PERIOD now ,COMMA how do you get it ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
but ,COMMA if you look at this plot ,COMMA you can see that countries that we think about as very similar actually exhibit very different behavior .PERIOD <BREAK>
they've passed the wrong piece of legislation .PERIOD whatever it is .PERIOD <BREAK>
the exact converse is also true .PERIOD <BREAK>
and they are actually going to romanticize this moment in time .PERIOD <BREAK>
now ,COMMA the nusha means the high .PERIOD <BREAK>
you can feel the difference in him and it's beautiful .PERIOD <BREAK>
now ,COMMA some of these same social investors are really interested in africa and understand the importance of agriculture ,COMMA and they even helped the farmers .PERIOD <BREAK>
i'll use these sidewalks in rio as an example .PERIOD <BREAK>
another suggestion has been ,COMMA since we're putting so many robots in the field ,COMMA we can see the time coming where they're actually going to be sending robots out in the field that are autonomous .PERIOD <BREAK>
think about if they are taken away from you ,COMMA if one day you don't actually have them for some reason or another .PERIOD <BREAK>
right now we may think of a big ,COMMA rich country like the u .PERIOD s .PERIOD doing this .PERIOD <BREAK>

the director of sports who's responsible for getting her into the program asks her to come out of class .PERIOD <BREAK>
so unlike traditional magic ,COMMA it uses the power of words ,COMMA linguistic deception ,COMMA non-verbal communication and various other techniques to create the illusion of a sixth sense .PERIOD <BREAK>
but not too long ago ,COMMA i came upon this on the web .PERIOD <BREAK>
if we know those things we can predict their behavior by assuming that everybody cares about two things on any decision .PERIOD <BREAK>
it pairs closely with love ,COMMA which is the will for the other to be happy ,COMMA which requires ,COMMA of course ,COMMA that one feels some happiness oneself and wishes to share it .PERIOD <BREAK>

you can get a mercedes for a very high price ,COMMA very high performance .PERIOD <BREAK>

it's also more benignly known as the honey mushroom or the humongous fungus because it happens to be one of the world's largest organisms as well .PERIOD <BREAK>

when you run the numbers on a calculator ,COMMA you run out of noughts .PERIOD <BREAK>
in case some of you forgot what play is ,COMMA this is what play looks like .PERIOD <BREAK>

there's a huge amount of information about the genetics just by comparing the genetic similarity .PERIOD <BREAK>
here's another really bad one .PERIOD <BREAK>
this time ,COMMA not only did my collectors disappear ,COMMA the political activists decided to ban me and to threaten me and to forbid me from showing .PERIOD <BREAK>

i usually say to people ,COMMA when they say ,COMMA what do you do ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>

there are no ideas and narratives and leaders and symbols advocating the democratic culture on the ground .PERIOD <BREAK>
when i first saw his picture ,COMMA i thought that these superpowers came from his super collar .PERIOD <BREAK>

he's got to find himself a babe and then he's got to latch on for life .PERIOD <BREAK>
they're the things that you'd snatch if the house was on fire .PERIOD <BREAK>

well ,COMMA acknowledge them .PERIOD <BREAK>
it wasn't until we really left earth ,COMMA got above the atmosphere and had seen the horizon bend back on itself ,COMMA that we could understand our planet as a limited condition .PERIOD <BREAK>
well ,COMMA because these sort of things reveal what the true state of ,COMMA say ,COMMA arab governments are like ,COMMA the true human-rights abuses in those governments .PERIOD <BREAK>
i also learned that some of our tastiest mushrooms can clean environmental toxins in soil .PERIOD <BREAK>
this was truly a revolution in surgery .PERIOD <BREAK>
we've heard about this and that .PERIOD but i actually went back and took what i could find ,COMMA the examples in history where there have been prohibitions against technology ,COMMA and then i tried to find out when they came back in ,COMMA because they always came back in .PERIOD and it turns out that the time ,COMMA the duration of when they were outlawed and prohibited ,COMMA is decreasing over time .PERIOD and that basically ,COMMA you can delay technology ,COMMA but you can't kill it .PERIOD so this makes sense ,COMMA because in a certain sense what culture is ,COMMA is the accumulation of ideas .PERIOD <BREAK>
companies can push producers faster than consumers can .PERIOD <BREAK>
they might say ,COMMA i've got a bit of nectar .PERIOD do you want to come and get it ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>

can you take this biosphere ,COMMA that has evolved on a planetary scale ,COMMA and jam it into a little bottle ,COMMA and will it survive ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>

so there was the cobe satellite ,COMMA which was launched in <NUM> ,COMMA and we discovered these variations .PERIOD <BREAK>
because reading is dependent upon the translation of word sounds into this orthographic or visual representational form .PERIOD <BREAK>
in three minutes ,COMMA you just fold this up .PERIOD <BREAK>
now that's a lot of money .PERIOD <BREAK>
but you'll see here a blocked page of what happens when you try to reach certain facebook pages and some other websites that the transitional authorities have determined might incite violence .PERIOD <BREAK>

this is all at the same time .PERIOD <BREAK>
because the truth is ,COMMA when they light their candles at ours ,COMMA there is twice as much light available for everyone .PERIOD <BREAK>
we have to control our numbers ,COMMA and i think this is as important as anything else that's being done in the world today .PERIOD <BREAK>

last slide .PERIOD <BREAK>
what document is it ,COMMA precisely ,COMMA you're talking about ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
back into the room ,COMMA we say ,COMMA hi ,COMMA we're back .PERIOD <BREAK>

and then a visitor from another painting by piero ,COMMA this is from the resurrection of christ -- as though the cast had just gotten of the set to have a chat .PERIOD <BREAK>
maybe it would be a study when we weren't having an atomic war ,COMMA or you could use it as a tv room ,COMMA or ,COMMA as many teenagers found out ,COMMA a very ,COMMA very safe place for a little privacy with your girlfriend .PERIOD <BREAK>
when you get sick ,COMMA it is a bug in your genome .PERIOD <BREAK>

i would never have to make a book and then present it to a gallery and let them decide if my work was nice enough to show it to people .PERIOD <BREAK>
if we were to direct efforts towards training cochlear implant users to hear music -- because right now there's virtually no effort put towards that ,COMMA no rehabilitative strategies ,COMMA very little in the way of technological advances to actually improve music -- we would come a long way .PERIOD <BREAK>
and you can get at them remotely ,COMMA if you happen to have a laptop .PERIOD <BREAK>
here we can see the original reference file being compared to the user generated content .PERIOD <BREAK>
thank you very much ,COMMA i appreciate it .PERIOD <BREAK>
i've shown you just a few things in italics here .PERIOD <BREAK>
six hundred degree f water coming out of the earth .PERIOD <BREAK>

instead of being made on the face of the cone ,COMMA it's made at literally billions of little independent points along this narrow column in the air ,COMMA and so when i aim it towards you ,COMMA what you hear is made right next to your ears .PERIOD <BREAK>
because the kaaba and the rituals around it are relics from the earliest phase of islam ,COMMA that of prophet muhammad .PERIOD <BREAK>

and so when i came in and i started walking around ,COMMA people -- they just knew what was going on .PERIOD <BREAK>
what was ,COMMA for me ,COMMA a very naive observation ,COMMA turned out to be a disaster .PERIOD <BREAK>
so i spent a long time .PERIOD <BREAK>

i think it helps in terms of the support if there are other women in the room .PERIOD <BREAK>
my office folds away ,COMMA easily hidden .PERIOD <BREAK>
we face huge issues as a world -- the financial crisis ,COMMA global warming and this growing sense of fear and otherness .PERIOD <BREAK>
she dreamt she and thousands of other women ended the bloodshed .PERIOD <BREAK>
i'll put the blindfold on .PERIOD <BREAK>

i think if our students ,COMMA if our high school students -- if all of the american citizens -- knew about probability and statistics ,COMMA we wouldn't be in the economic mess that we're in today .PERIOD <BREAK>
but that's not the whole story ,COMMA because there are signals ,COMMA electrical signals ,COMMA that travel along the branches of neurons and chemical signals that jump across from branch to branch .PERIOD <BREAK>
because with that beautiful photo ,COMMA maybe i can also package this little box here that talks about how steaming and boiling actually take different amounts of time .PERIOD <BREAK>

and for me china -- i started photographing it four years ago ,COMMA and china truly is a question of sustainability in my mind ,COMMA not to mention that china ,COMMA as well ,COMMA has a great effect on the industries that i grew up around .PERIOD <BREAK>
we accompanied joshua ,COMMA as he walked the earth ,COMMA visiting villages where he had once killed and raped .PERIOD <BREAK>
by the ' <NUM> s ,COMMA home cooking was in such a sad state that the high fat and spice contents of foods like mcnuggets and hot pockets -- and we all have our favorites ,COMMA actually -- made this stuff more appealing than the bland things that people were serving at home .PERIOD <BREAK>

my colleagues actually went on to test this limitation ,COMMA by increasing the moment of inertia of a student ,COMMA so they had a tail ,COMMA and running them through and obstacle course ,COMMA and found a decrement in performance ,COMMA like you'd predict .PERIOD <BREAK>
maybe we should make people save more when they make more money .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA this is climber .PERIOD <BREAK>
why is it that nelson has access to a cutting-edge technology ,COMMA like the cellphone ,COMMA but doesn't have access to a <NUM> -year-old technology for generating electric light in the home ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
data :COLON i find it incredibly educational .PERIOD <BREAK>
then i went somewhere else .PERIOD <BREAK>
those little lines ?QUESTIONMARK that's the power .PERIOD <BREAK>
perfect .PERIOD <BREAK>
and to say all these years of trying to make a better world ,COMMA and we have failed .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i want to sort of point out the big advantage of framing health in this external way .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's to bring purpose to the lives of millions ,COMMA and he has succeeded .PERIOD <BREAK>
that's the way these things work .PERIOD <BREAK>
the people's supermarket .PERIOD <BREAK>

do you know what ?QUESTIONMARK it's funny ,COMMA but right now it's kind of like that again .PERIOD <BREAK>
keep to the track ,COMMA to the beaten track ;SEMICOLON memory holds all you need of the truth .PERIOD <BREAK>

the world bank president was a third-grader one time .PERIOD <BREAK>

he invented the pencil .PERIOD <BREAK>
so i'm going to get us all on a time machine ,COMMA and we're going to the left ;SEMICOLON we're going to go back to the past to see what the ocean was like .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it's interesting ,COMMA if you think about it ,COMMA how ,COMMA when we think about the civilizations that we look up to as having been pinnacles of human achievement -- whether it's china ,COMMA greece ,COMMA the hindu civilization ,COMMA or the mayas ,COMMA or egyptians -- what we know about them is really about their ecstasies ,COMMA not about their everyday life .PERIOD <BREAK>
i hit my head on my desk .PERIOD i broke my cheekbone ,COMMA i got five stitches on my right eye .PERIOD <BREAK>

maniac regained its memory ,COMMA when the power went off .PERIOD machine or human ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
we do have one unintentional dancer actually ,COMMA the last thing i'm going to show you .PERIOD <BREAK>
now to make sure that this was no reaction of the fly to a flash it could see ,COMMA susana did a simple but brutally effective experiment .PERIOD <BREAK>

so the culture ,COMMA the northern aboriginal culture ,COMMA traditionally has been highly seasonal .PERIOD <BREAK>
the retina chip that we designed sits behind this lens here .PERIOD <BREAK>

failing that ,COMMA visualized information can just look really cool .PERIOD <BREAK>
that is true .PERIOD that is the reality of the world that we live in .PERIOD <BREAK>

he said ,COMMA if the one tribe included a great number of courageous ,COMMA sympathetic and faithful members who are always ready to aid and defend each other ,COMMA this tribe would succeed better and conquer the other .PERIOD <BREAK>

it is more and more often a way of creating an environment for convening and supporting groups .PERIOD <BREAK>

every person who has one of those filter papers has at least ,COMMA at a minimum ,COMMA been through our basic health education about the risks associated with these activities ,COMMA which presumably ,COMMA from our perspective ,COMMA gives them the ability to decrease their own risk ,COMMA and then obviously the risk to their families ,COMMA the village ,COMMA the country ,COMMA and the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
so one of the reasons that i have come here to talk about this today is to -- frankly ,COMMA selfishly -- unburden myself and let it be known that this is not an untroubled mind that has written all of these books .PERIOD <BREAK>
in science ,COMMA we don't care how many letters you have after your name .PERIOD <BREAK>
what's happening here ,COMMA in the middle of the <NUM> th century ,COMMA was that what became my field -- science ,COMMA experimental science -- was pulling itself away ,COMMA and it was in a physical way ,COMMA because we're going to do it in this room over here ,COMMA but it was also what -- it was an amazing thing that happened .PERIOD <BREAK>
the last card he pulled ,COMMA which was representing my destiny was this guy on like a straw boater with a cane and you know ,COMMA sort of spats and this ,COMMA you know ,COMMA a minstrel singer ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>

at <NUM> ,COMMA my death would have been entirely expected .PERIOD <BREAK>
that's what life is :COLON it's an information process that was restructuring and making new order .PERIOD <BREAK>

the room itself is three stories tall .PERIOD <BREAK>
but the basis of our conversation was the different approach to spirituality on the part of the muslim and buddhist traditions .PERIOD <BREAK>

those shapes are difficult to change .PERIOD <BREAK>

we did that one year ahead of the time when the first clinical trial funded by the nih for millions of dollars failed for futility last week ,COMMA and announced it .PERIOD <BREAK>

by using this engaging popular format for traditional ,COMMA local culture ,COMMA it actually ,COMMA in the gulf ,COMMA is precipitating a revival of interest in nabati poetry ,COMMA also in traditional dress and dance and music .PERIOD <BREAK>
so that sort of space exploration thing is matched up here by the amount of content that's in there ,COMMA and i think that amount is critical .PERIOD <BREAK>
in the midst of the wreckage at ground zero ,COMMA i had a realization .PERIOD <BREAK>

there was a burning question though that would not leave me .PERIOD <BREAK>
one is people need a guarantee they won't be evicted .PERIOD <BREAK>
of course ,COMMA i could just make up an answer and you wouldn't know ,COMMA so i come prepared for that .PERIOD <BREAK>
you see the scar form .PERIOD <BREAK>
let's say we converted all the vehicles in the united states to battery electric vehicles ,COMMA hydrogen fuel cell vehicles or flex fuel vehicles run on e <NUM> .PERIOD <BREAK>

here's some reconstructions of some of the fossils that have been found from lake turkana .PERIOD <BREAK>
the shift is away from the medical model that focuses only on the individual .PERIOD <BREAK>

so consumers ,COMMA and i don't just mean people who buy stuff at the safeway ;SEMICOLON i mean people at the defense department who might buy something ,COMMA or people at ,COMMA you know ,COMMA the new yorker who might print your article .PERIOD <BREAK>

polar bears need ice to be able to move back and forth -- they're not very good swimmers -- and we know what's happening to the ice .PERIOD <BREAK>

if you look around at the birds ,COMMA there are a lot of birds in the gulf that concentrate in the gulf at certain times of the year ,COMMA but then leave .PERIOD <BREAK>
so what we're saying is that scalability should not become an enemy of sustainability .PERIOD <BREAK>
and our hope is that ,COMMA by figuring out brain circuits at a level of abstraction that lets us repair them and engineer them ,COMMA we can take some of these intractable disorders that i told you about earlier ,COMMA practically none of which are cured ,COMMA and in the <NUM> st century make them history .PERIOD <BREAK>
and that's a very basic question ,COMMA which we don't know the answer to ,COMMA but which we can try -- and we are trying -- to answer in the lab .PERIOD <BREAK>
and what was really most exciting -- and i think richard wurman discovered this at least <NUM> years before i did -- was that all this stuff is connected .PERIOD <BREAK>

this insight that entropy increases ,COMMA by the way ,COMMA is what's behind what we call the arrow of time ,COMMA the difference between the past and the future .PERIOD <BREAK>
as a part of -- you know ,COMMA part of what we want to do to grow our company is to have more searches .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it's too cerebral to animate guts and hearts and behavior when the going gets rough .PERIOD <BREAK>
some people say that democracy consists basically in elections .PERIOD <BREAK>

you see them on the mountains up there .PERIOD <BREAK>
it extends from the subatomic scale to the farthest reaches of the cosmos .PERIOD <BREAK>

and tomasz ,COMMA a young polish man said ,COMMA i don't need twenty kinds of chewing gum .PERIOD <BREAK>
well ,COMMA one of the things that is really critical to try to distill from that experience is that in addition to that ,COMMA people ask me and say ,COMMA well ,COMMA how did your parents treat you when you were a child ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>

everything we do ,COMMA we believe in challenging the status quo .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's meant to be a bit of a game .PERIOD <BREAK>
do it because you like to do it .PERIOD <BREAK>
and we make it incredibly easy to volunteer .PERIOD <BREAK>
i'm speaking to you about what i call the mesh .PERIOD <BREAK>
now ,COMMA what stephen hawking mentioned ,COMMA as well ,COMMA is that after the big bang ,COMMA space expanded at a very rapid rate .PERIOD <BREAK>

<NUM> :COLON america had small families and long life ;SEMICOLON vietnam had large families and short lives .PERIOD and this is what happens :COLON the data during the war indicate that even with all the death ,COMMA there was an improvement of life expectancy .PERIOD by the end of the year ,COMMA the family planning started in vietnam and they went for smaller families .PERIOD <BREAK>

mid-sized company in the midwest ,COMMA blue collar employees struggling to pay their bills repeatedly told us they cannot save more right away .PERIOD <BREAK>
and that's what all good stories should do at the beginning ,COMMA is they should give you a promise .PERIOD <BREAK>
so they inhaled it ,COMMA but they are not aware of it .PERIOD <BREAK>
now we fear changes on the map .PERIOD <BREAK>
so like i said ,COMMA i don't actually know the answer .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's been missing in much of the architecture ,COMMA because we think architecture is the realm of the neutered ,COMMA the realm of the kind of a state that has no opinion ,COMMA that has no value .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA how are you going to write your letter ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and then you could have an entrance which was very rough and narrow as you first went in ,COMMA that gradually becomes more refined and then actually quite exquisite .PERIOD <BREAK>
i'm not a fan of peta ,COMMA but i think this is a great ad .PERIOD <BREAK>
so we wanted to change the way that students approach technology ,COMMA to create a more convivial and social space that was more engaging ,COMMA more accessible ,COMMA and also to increase the ability for teachers to use these spaces for technology-based instruction .PERIOD <BREAK>
but then they need a different political process than the one they were given in <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> .PERIOD <BREAK>
the public's perception will probably be somewhat better than that .PERIOD <BREAK>
so we actually used the right to information act ,COMMA which is equal to the freedom of information act in the united states ,COMMA and pushed back the officers in this particular case .PERIOD <BREAK>
so let's bring up a video of that .PERIOD <BREAK>
unusual things are beginning to happen .PERIOD <BREAK>

well ,COMMA mdg <NUM> .PERIOD <BREAK>

kiran bir sethi :COLON and the city will give free time .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's an assumption that modernity is a product simply of competition ,COMMA markets and technology .PERIOD <BREAK>

so i joined a gym .PERIOD <BREAK>
it makes them meet .PERIOD <BREAK>
we couldn't afford to hire a cfo .PERIOD we put out a job description for a cfo at zero salary ,COMMA and we had a queue of people .PERIOD <BREAK>
and that kind of gave me the inspiration -- or rather to be precise ,COMMA it gave my wife the inspiration .PERIOD <BREAK>

there should be a snowball effect ,COMMA a positive feedback ,COMMA such that the more names we have ,COMMA the more we get .PERIOD <BREAK>
they don't change the end result .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it read -- i'm just going to read a key sentence :COLON especially during these violent times ,COMMA i personally believe that the magical spell cast upon guests who visit our theme parks is particularly important to protect and helps to provide them with an important fantasy they can escape to .PERIOD <BREAK>

not just a superficial image of it ,COMMA though it contains that as well ,COMMA but an explanatory model ,COMMA embodying the same mathematical relationships and the same causal structure .PERIOD <BREAK>
you assume that .PERIOD <BREAK>

all they needed to do that more quickly and to do it better was a little bit of capital .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is neda ,COMMA the iranian girl who was shot while at a demonstration with her father in iran only a few weeks ago ,COMMA and she is now the focus ,COMMA rightly so ,COMMA of the youtube generation .PERIOD <BREAK>

the manner in which we mistreat our public spaces is a huge obstacle towards any type of progressive political change because we've essentially put a price tag on freedom of expression .PERIOD <BREAK>
and this was for a fund that the school district had to put a desktop computer and a broadband internet connection in every home with a child in the public school system .PERIOD <BREAK>

the germans figured out how to use it right ,COMMA and so what we have to think about for the u .PERIOD s .PERIOD is that we are ahead right now ,COMMA but you have <NUM> other countries out there working on military robotics ,COMMA and they include all the interesting countries like russia ,COMMA china ,COMMA pakistan ,COMMA iran .PERIOD <BREAK>

if you start green ,COMMA it's like <NUM> to <NUM> percent .PERIOD <BREAK>
engineering can be inspired by biology by using its principles and analogies when they're advantageous ,COMMA but then integrating that with the best human engineering ,COMMA ultimately to make something actually better than nature .PERIOD <BREAK>
some of the technologies we've been talking about ,COMMA you invented them ,COMMA or at least revolutionized the way that they're used .PERIOD <BREAK>

now we ,COMMA as humans ,COMMA we store our information as dna in our genomes and we pass this information on to our offspring .PERIOD <BREAK>
and what does that mean in a universe where we are right now the highest form of stuff ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
but of course ,COMMA the block of data just contains the amount of x-ray that's been absorbed in each point in the human body .PERIOD <BREAK>
and <NUM> years into the project ,COMMA the skeptics were still going strong -- says ,COMMA you're two-thirds through this project ,COMMA and you've managed to only sequence a very tiny percentage of the whole genome .PERIOD <BREAK>
who else can i meet that i don't know ,COMMA or that i'm so different from ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
they took off her colorful sari .PERIOD <BREAK>
myself included .PERIOD <BREAK>
i'm laughing out loud .PERIOD <BREAK>
and watch again ,COMMA right there -- successful .PERIOD <BREAK>
so we put together focused nano beam writers and supersonic water jet cutters and excimer micro-machining systems .PERIOD <BREAK>
and some of them ,COMMA like paleontological shvisle ,COMMA they contain snoop dogg .PERIOD <BREAK>
so let me invite you to consider taking the third side ,COMMA even as a very small step .PERIOD <BREAK>
because you know ,COMMA some of the extraordinary things i've experienced as a musician ,COMMA when you may have a <NUM> -year-old lad who has got the most incredible challenges ,COMMA who may not be able to control his movements ,COMMA who may be deaf ,COMMA who may be blind ,COMMA etc .PERIOD etc .PERIOD -- suddenly ,COMMA if that young lad sits close to this instrument ,COMMA and perhaps even lies underneath the marimba ,COMMA and you play something that's so incredibly organ-like ,COMMA almost -- i don't really have the right sticks ,COMMA perhaps -- but something like this .PERIOD let me change .PERIOD <BREAK>
so you see the leaflets opening and closing -- of this heart valve that's currently being used experimentally to try to get it to further studies .PERIOD <BREAK>
i needed tools that were robust ,COMMA modular ,COMMA highly efficient and optimized ,COMMA low-cost ,COMMA made from local and recycled materials that would last a lifetime ,COMMA not designed for obsolescence .PERIOD <BREAK>
i don't work with people in any kind of traumatic situation .PERIOD <BREAK>
bundle up the message .PERIOD send the same message to everybody .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's a story that was told to me by somebody who had heard it just from one of the -- probably a true story .PERIOD <BREAK>
why is it that business leaders and investors quite often don't see the connection between creating the intangible of employee happiness with creating the tangible of financial profits in their business ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and i took my bike into the bike store-- i love this -- same bike ,COMMA and they'd do something called truing the wheels .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i'm tired of living like this ,COMMA going into town after town with people standing around on corners with holes where eyes used to be ,COMMA their spirits damaged .PERIOD <BREAK>
interestingly enough ,COMMA in other countries ,COMMA it will be the minister of finance who sees it as an engine of economic growth .PERIOD <BREAK>
and you do that by measuring the relative activation of the left prefrontal cortex in the fmri ,COMMA versus the right prefrontal cortex .PERIOD <BREAK>
and stakeholders with specific trade-offs will try to influence the decision .PERIOD <BREAK>
they're going to be willing to brainstorm ,COMMA name suspects ,COMMA provide details .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so what they found ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA is that exploitation really began heavily with the romans .PERIOD <BREAK>
but barely six months into my new job ,COMMA i met a woman who forced me to challenge all my assumptions .PERIOD <BREAK>
the reason i get personally pissed-off about running shoes is because i bought a million of them and i kept getting hurt .PERIOD <BREAK>
and you don't need the three billion-dollar hadron collider for doing this .PERIOD <BREAK>
the international committee of the red cross ,COMMA the icrc ,COMMA is talking to everyone ,COMMA and it is doing so because it is neutral .PERIOD <BREAK>
she goes to school on the first day .PERIOD <BREAK>
but this story's not about eliminating it ,COMMA it's about minimizing it .PERIOD <BREAK>
no sooner was it proposed than reformers in nigeria adopted it ,COMMA pushed it and published the revenues in the paper .PERIOD <BREAK>
really the question that i think about with these ants is what i call task allocation .PERIOD <BREAK>
you can see the tumor treating field field generator ,COMMA but importantly you can also see that she is living her life .PERIOD <BREAK>
let's say it's <NUM> .PERIOD <NUM> seconds in europe .PERIOD <BREAK>
and one of them said ,COMMA come here .PERIOD i think i can help you out here .PERIOD <BREAK>
these people over there will do everything they can to stop these kinds of organizations succeeding ,COMMA because they're threatened by them .PERIOD <BREAK>
now if i want to talk about the defense of my country ,COMMA i have to speak to the minister of health because pandemic disease is a threat to my security ,COMMA i have to speak to the minister of agriculture because food security is a threat to my security ,COMMA i have to speak to the minister of industry because the fragility of our hi-tech infrastructure is now a point of attack for our enemies -- as we see from cyber warfare -- i have to speak to the minister of home affairs because who has entered my country ,COMMA who lives in that terraced house in that inner city has a direct effect on what happens in my country -- as we in london saw in the <NUM> / <NUM> bombings .PERIOD <BREAK>
and he said ,COMMA sir ,COMMA he's fine .PERIOD thanks for asking .PERIOD <BREAK>
you're saying that you must ,COMMA and you have a duty to help those countries that cannot afford to deal with the problems of climate change themselves .PERIOD <BREAK>
okay ,COMMA we're naive ,COMMA we're bright-eyed and bushy-tailed .PERIOD <BREAK>
the country is in peril .PERIOD i need them by my side .PERIOD <BREAK>
at that time ,COMMA there was only one bank that had atms in kenya ,COMMA and we could not get cash .PERIOD the family couldn't get cash for him to start the treatment until monday .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA what's unique about the site is that it's anonymous ,COMMA and it has no memory .PERIOD <BREAK>
girl <NUM> :COLON uh ,COMMA yeah .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the story of that ,COMMA i thought ,COMMA was really fascinating .PERIOD <BREAK>
stayed in service till it was too rusty to fly ,COMMA taken out of service .PERIOD <BREAK>
may we have our jumping music please ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
they're really approaching ,COMMA in many cases surpassing ,COMMA the ability of the human mind .PERIOD <BREAK>
cisco actually estimates that ,COMMA within four years ,COMMA more than <NUM> percent of the web's data will be video .PERIOD <BREAK>
and that pyramid in monterey ,COMMA right now ,COMMA because of the efforts of a lot of different people ,COMMA is functioning better than it's ever functioned for the last <NUM> years .PERIOD <BREAK>
helium- <NUM> :COLON very rare on the surface of the earth ,COMMA very common in space .PERIOD <BREAK>
are we superman ?QUESTIONMARK or are we homer simpson ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
we'll find some that work .PERIOD we'll build on those .PERIOD <BREAK>
and in a way ,COMMA that's true ,COMMA because everything is vibrating .PERIOD <BREAK>
so as you send a movement command down ,COMMA you tap a copy of that off and run it into your neural simulator to anticipate the sensory consequences of your actions .PERIOD <BREAK>
now ,COMMA what that means is that all of the organisms that live in the sea have evolved in this chemostatted ocean ,COMMA with co <NUM> levels lower than they are today .PERIOD <BREAK>
last night i heard my daughter praying for the meat here at my feet .PERIOD <BREAK>
i showed you the other model ,COMMA the one -- this is the way i organized myself so i could make the drawing -- so i understood the problem .PERIOD <BREAK>
but you can't tell me ,COMMA no ,COMMA i can't be mowgli ,COMMA because guess what ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
the last time i got an e-mail from a journalist saying ,COMMA why do academics hate wikipedia ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
like economists ,COMMA you know ,COMMA their definition of rational ,COMMA that we all act out of our own economic self-interest .PERIOD <BREAK>
and -- they don't throw it at each other ,COMMA but this is a fundamental part of being playful .PERIOD <BREAK>
it looks like your average high school cafeteria in your average town in america .PERIOD <BREAK>
and while that swim took place three years ago ,COMMA i can remember it as if it was yesterday .PERIOD <BREAK>
the original thought i had :COLON this must be ethanol .PERIOD <BREAK>
a button ,COMMA two guitar picks and lots of hot glue .PERIOD <BREAK>
i think the man was maybe <NUM> years too early ,COMMA so let's do it .PERIOD <BREAK>
we're holding ourselves back because we don't value play .PERIOD <BREAK>
i personally obsessed about every nut ,COMMA bolt and washer in these crazy things .PERIOD <BREAK>
remember this .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is good information to have ,COMMA and it's not that complicated .PERIOD <BREAK>
i had no contingency plan for four million .PERIOD <BREAK>
and then i realized it was me ,COMMA you know ,COMMA and i kind of laughed .PERIOD <BREAK>
india was not always like this level .PERIOD <BREAK>
if you look here ,COMMA here's linux in red ,COMMA and it's hit <NUM> percent .PERIOD <BREAK>
the difference between coffee at <NUM> and coffee at <NUM> is a difference between coffee that makes you wince ,COMMA and coffee that makes you deliriously happy .PERIOD <BREAK>
but i really appreciate being here .PERIOD and thank you ,COMMA chris ,COMMA and also ,COMMA thank you ,COMMA deborah patton ,COMMA for making this possible .PERIOD <BREAK>
e :COLON cock-a-doodle-doo !EXCLAMATIONMARK <BREAK>
and i will give you two little snippets -- two examples -- of projects we're involved in in my group in oxford ,COMMA both of which i think are rather exciting .PERIOD <BREAK>
and what we're finding is actually ,COMMA even at the brain biochemical level ,COMMA we are quite similar .PERIOD <BREAK>
a new wave of openness and democratization in which ,COMMA since <NUM> ,COMMA more than two-thirds of african countries have had multi-party democratic elections .PERIOD <BREAK>
and you're completely flamed out .PERIOD don't do it .PERIOD <BREAK>
here comes euler .PERIOD <BREAK>
and what i want to do now is say a bit about this book from the design standpoint ,COMMA because i think it's actually a brilliant book .PERIOD <BREAK>
the g <NUM> nations have been incredibly generous on polio over the last <NUM> years ,COMMA but we're starting to have something called polio fatigue and that is that the donor nations aren't willing to fund polio any longer .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA social production is a real fact ,COMMA not a fad .PERIOD <BREAK>
so we perceive nothing as what it really is .PERIOD <BREAK>
by buying a space that was <NUM> sq .PERIOD ft .PERIOD <BREAK>
there's the larvae ,COMMA and they consume most of the food .PERIOD <BREAK>
it is this breathtaking image -- success ,COMMA of course -- that motivates us and motivates kids to follow and understand rocket science :COLON to understand the importance of physics and math and ,COMMA in many ways ,COMMA to sort of have that awe at exploration of the frontiers of the unknown .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is already available today .PERIOD <BREAK>
so that when it gets dark ,COMMA i've got plenty of power .PERIOD <BREAK>
great ,COMMA here we go .PERIOD <BREAK>
second ,COMMA if you're pre-menopausal ,COMMA try to schedule your mammogram in the first two weeks of your menstrual cycle ,COMMA when breast density is relatively lower .PERIOD <BREAK>
there's a class of cells ,COMMA a fairly small cell ,COMMA an inhibitory cell ,COMMA that quiets its neighbors .PERIOD <BREAK>
there are two ways of thinking about this .PERIOD <BREAK>
so i hope that i've convinced you that there's a lot of great ,COMMA interesting things to be learned about how nature makes materials -- and taking it the next step to see if you can force ,COMMA or whether you can take advantage of how nature makes materials ,COMMA to make things that nature hasn't yet dreamed of making .PERIOD <BREAK>
so the first thing i want to look at is how long ,COMMA how long did people interact with these systems .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is a parachutist with another parachutist doing exactly the same thing .PERIOD <BREAK>
i don't know what i'm missing to say ,COMMA but as a last thing ,COMMA i'd like to say is that if we continue along this path ,COMMA we are designing our children's best friends .PERIOD <BREAK>
we won't make it as a country unless we can turn this thing around .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's kind of arrogant .PERIOD <BREAK>
before we went out as a tour ,COMMA he went out solo and did it first .PERIOD <BREAK>
so we trained them to be able to do three separate words ,COMMA to lay out them properly .PERIOD <BREAK>
this has been replicated over and over and over again ,COMMA for nearly <NUM> years .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it's this combination ,COMMA this cumulative technology ,COMMA that intrigues me ,COMMA because i think it's the secret to understanding what's happening in the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA if that's not the purpose of the universe ,COMMA then what's next ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
nor is it some sort of indistinguishable mash .PERIOD <BREAK>
i call it the idea of tribes .PERIOD <BREAK>
benoit has been particularly interested in nested patterns ,COMMA in fractals and so on ,COMMA where the structure is something that's kind of tree-like ,COMMA and where there's sort of a big branch that makes little branches and even smaller branches and so on .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA most of the time they repel .PERIOD <BREAK>
now ,COMMA this lady ,COMMA on the wall of the dung cake heap ,COMMA has made a painting .PERIOD <BREAK>
if you have manageable health problems it doesn't really matter .PERIOD <BREAK>
i wish there was a liberal arts college in every african country .PERIOD <BREAK>
and aggregated ,COMMA these smaller interceptions could actually infiltrate all the roadborne pollution that now runs into the estuary system ,COMMA up to a seven inch rain event ,COMMA up to a hundred-year storm .PERIOD <BREAK>
as late as <NUM> ,COMMA ibm was known to say you couldn't possibly build a corporate network using internet protocol .PERIOD <BREAK>
with the same method ,COMMA we can also get him to circle a person .PERIOD <BREAK>
james nachtwey ,COMMA who was honored at last year's ted ,COMMA took a look at the sweep of the medical system that is utilized to handle the american wounded coming out of iraq .PERIOD <BREAK>
and each gene gives us a fingerprint .PERIOD <BREAK>
but the nice thing about visual illusion is we can easily demonstrate mistakes .PERIOD <BREAK>
and as you come to a new valley ,COMMA as you come to a new landscape ,COMMA you have a certain view .PERIOD <BREAK>
there's no roads into the sahara .PERIOD it's an enormous place .PERIOD <BREAK>
we are born into a box of time and space .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA the wind carries the sand onto the site and then it carries the redundant sand away from the structure for us .PERIOD <BREAK>
running time :COLON two minutes .PERIOD input ,COMMA output :COLON <NUM> minutes .PERIOD <BREAK>
then your companion will dig you in the ribs and say ,COMMA wake up !EXCLAMATIONMARK it's culture !EXCLAMATIONMARK and then you feel even worse .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's not enough to just teach that you can express yourself .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so i showed up in this dark ,COMMA rambling new york apartment ,COMMA and she called out to me ,COMMA and she was in bed .PERIOD <BREAK>
monterey is one of the few places in the world where molas come in large numbers .PERIOD <BREAK>
noah needed to take two of every kind of bird ,COMMA of every kind of animal ,COMMA of every kind of creature that moves ,COMMA but no mention about plants .PERIOD <BREAK>
why did this happen ?QUESTIONMARK this happened because the patriot act was a unilateral legislation .PERIOD <BREAK>
perhaps dogs and rhinos and other smell-oriented animals smell in color .PERIOD and the argument would be exactly the same as for the bats .PERIOD <BREAK>
and one of the good things about this cure was that it was free ,COMMA virtually free ,COMMA and was very easy to use .PERIOD <BREAK>
another thing that can be very ,COMMA very ,COMMA very successful is there is a lot of people that may have retired from working in the software industry ,COMMA and they can teach your kid .PERIOD <BREAK>
for many years this went along ,COMMA and everything was fine .PERIOD <BREAK>
george bernard shaw said it a little differently .PERIOD <BREAK>
and my hump ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and we're seeing that already with ,COMMA say ,COMMA phones .PERIOD <BREAK>
think about bittersweet chocolate ;SEMICOLON or think about the acidity of yogurt -- wonderful -- mixed with strawberry fruits .PERIOD <BREAK>
so in conclusion ,COMMA i want to turn back to that very slide that made such a deep impact on me all those years ago .PERIOD <BREAK>
i want to hear the pieces that horowitz didn't play .PERIOD <BREAK>
and this is essential to the progress of science ,COMMA or exploration of what is possible .PERIOD <BREAK>
and we should be very alert to this .PERIOD <BREAK>
but i learned two very ,COMMA very important lessons there on mt .PERIOD everest ,COMMA and i thank my team of sherpas who taught me this .PERIOD <BREAK>
no .PERIOD <BREAK>
first ,COMMA just a little bit about me .PERIOD <BREAK>
but more than that ,COMMA people are building green houses around green school ,COMMA so their kids can walk to school on the paths .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it’s rare ,COMMA because we never really get to see a brain .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's called the pole adit .PERIOD and it does have tungsten ,COMMA a little bit of tungsten ,COMMA left over ,COMMA that's the kind of mine it was .PERIOD <BREAK>
we lose <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> people a year in the u .PERIOD s .PERIOD from sudden cardiac death .PERIOD <BREAK>
and we can therefore visualize a space of possible changes in the experience of these beings .PERIOD <BREAK>
i like to ,COMMA as i said ,COMMA talk about things i know nothing about .PERIOD <BREAK>
rod :COLON no ,COMMA not me ,COMMA no .PERIOD <BREAK>
resting on the saucer were two packets of sugar .PERIOD <BREAK>
but maybe mission blue can fill in that ocean that we can't see .PERIOD <BREAK>
because triangles are the only rigid structures .PERIOD <BREAK>
and he was walking around .PERIOD <BREAK>
hers is more into boys .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the answer to the question is no .PERIOD those are actually blue flowers .PERIOD <BREAK>
so that inspired me to think about ,COMMA well ,COMMA what if i try to use this idea in order ,COMMA not to detect random texts from texts with meaning ,COMMA but rather detect the fact that there is meaning in the biomolecules that make up life .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i suspect many of you probably gave something towards that problem as well ,COMMA but somehow it doesn't happen with the same intensity .PERIOD <BREAK>
there are a number of techniques to harvest rain .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the kid was drinking it ,COMMA and a security guard spotted it ,COMMA and called the police ,COMMA who called an ambulance that rushed to the ballpark ,COMMA whisked the kid to the hospital .PERIOD <BREAK>
♫ i want to thank you ,COMMA thank you ♫ ♫ thank you ,COMMA thank you ♫ ♫ thank you ,COMMA thank you ♫ ♫ thank you ,COMMA thank you ♫ ♫ i want to thank you ,COMMA thank you ♫ it works better ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
my parents were both elected to the first parliament ,COMMA alongside nelson and winnie mandela .PERIOD they were the only other couple .PERIOD <BREAK>
approach the cow .PERIOD <BREAK>
same thing for processor speeds .PERIOD <BREAK>
so early on ,COMMA i heard of charles darwin .PERIOD <BREAK>
i would give the boy probably about <NUM> seconds ,COMMA which means ,COMMA by the time he got to me ,COMMA i was already saying things like ,COMMA why are you crying ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
these christians ,COMMA who are these christians ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and in fact you need one laptop to do all the calculations just for one neuron .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA it was in the course of these investigations that i ran into a map .PERIOD <BREAK>
this geo-engineering idea ,COMMA in it's simplest form ,COMMA is basically the following .PERIOD <BREAK>
t ,COMMA e ,COMMA d .PERIOD <BREAK>
i simply want you to keep in mind that if in the past ,COMMA new forms of cooperation enabled by new technologies create new forms of wealth ,COMMA we may be moving into yet another economic form that is significantly different from previous ones .PERIOD <BREAK>
by leveraging and by embracing the expertise within the company ,COMMA best buy was able to discover ,COMMA for example ,COMMA that the store that it was going to open in china -- its big ,COMMA grand store -- was not going to open on time .PERIOD <BREAK>
i don't eat breakfast .PERIOD no lunch .PERIOD <BREAK>
the two blobs that are light in the middle there are the united states and europe .PERIOD <BREAK>
so an example might be ,COMMA if you go back <NUM> years ago when electricity was first becoming common ,COMMA there were a lot of fears about it .PERIOD <BREAK>
he is the model of non-violence ,COMMA non-violence -- and they would all like to be in his spirit .PERIOD <BREAK>
woman :COLON <NUM> .PERIOD <BREAK>
this new soft structural method enables me to model these and build these sculptures at the scale of skyscrapers .PERIOD <BREAK>
and she has this one passage here .PERIOD <BREAK>
the fact is that ours is the first generation that can look disease and extreme poverty in the eye ,COMMA look across the ocean to africa ,COMMA and say this ,COMMA and mean it :COLON we do not have to stand for this .PERIOD <BREAK>
now ,COMMA when the debris washes up on the beaches of hawaii it looks like this .PERIOD <BREAK>
and most kids do .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is a figure that i love :COLON bradley ,COMMA petrie ,COMMA and dumais .PERIOD <BREAK>
how big a contractor team would you need to put this universe together ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
so ,COMMA what's needed now is to rebuild these boundaries .PERIOD <BREAK>
come on up .PERIOD tell everybody your name .PERIOD <BREAK>
journalism had provided a channel for people's natural sense of generosity ,COMMA and the readers responded .PERIOD <BREAK>
there is a little-known mission that was launched by the pentagon ,COMMA <NUM> years ago now ,COMMA called clementine .PERIOD <BREAK>
so in a broad sense ,COMMA we don't need to think about technology as only little gadgets ,COMMA like these things here ,COMMA but even institutions and techniques ,COMMA psychological methods and so forth .PERIOD <BREAK>
i would bet there aren't <NUM> percent of you in the room that know how many aircraft carriers there are in the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
and one of the buttons at the bottom ,COMMA you'll notice ,COMMA is not print .PERIOD <BREAK>
what does the word public mean today anyway ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
there are tons of other things that we should think about doing .PERIOD <BREAK>
and they're learning to become like us .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's getting blunter and blunter .PERIOD <BREAK>
thank you ,COMMA and god bless all of you .PERIOD <BREAK>
ask the chairpersons and ceos of sotheby's and christie's .PERIOD <BREAK>
so this is actually a <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> -square-foot kite ,COMMA which also happens to be a minimal energy surface .PERIOD <BREAK>
even working with individual companies is not probably going to get us there .PERIOD <BREAK>
she saved <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> girls from being cut .PERIOD <BREAK>
about nine years ago ,COMMA i came across a policy statement -- very well-intentioned -- which said ,COMMA college begins in kindergarten .PERIOD <BREAK>
so it's all about coal ,COMMA and the chinese are here in the united states .PERIOD <BREAK>
so in the technological world ,COMMA we don't have experience to judge models .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i said ,COMMA if you're serious ,COMMA i will try to find a family for her .PERIOD <BREAK>
imagine ,COMMA with somebody who's lost their whole arm ,COMMA we still have four major nerves that go down your arm .PERIOD <BREAK>
but the real award came from society for newspaper design .PERIOD <BREAK>
i'm in that world ,COMMA but i work purely instinctively .PERIOD <BREAK>
at least you can then decide whether it goes left or -- oh ,COMMA simulcast .PERIOD sorry !EXCLAMATIONMARK i forgot .PERIOD i forgot .PERIOD ok ,COMMA so wherever the camera is -- ok ,COMMA good point .PERIOD thank you ,COMMA chris .PERIOD <BREAK>
which is something you never want to do professionally .PERIOD <BREAK>
and actually true to form ,COMMA renault has put a billion and a half dollars in building nine different types of cars that fit this kind of model that will come into the market in mass volume -- mass volume being the first year ,COMMA <NUM> thousand cars .PERIOD <BREAK>
at this ripe old age of <NUM> ,COMMA i've been thinking a lot about what it means to grow up in this horrible ,COMMA beautiful time ,COMMA and i've decided ,COMMA for me ,COMMA it's been a real journey and paradox .PERIOD <BREAK>
physical therapies can be done ,COMMA not only in the orthopedic center ,COMMA but also in the houses of the people .PERIOD <BREAK>
it learns how to find the target smell in a cage with several holes ,COMMA up to <NUM> holes .PERIOD <BREAK>
so some of you actually saw me at ted ,COMMA <NUM> years ago .PERIOD <BREAK>
and this became my holy grail ,COMMA my rosetta stone .PERIOD <BREAK>
but the thing is ,COMMA how come it's news to most people ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
so ,COMMA who got more than five circles figured out ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
so ,COMMA i think the first thing that the blogosphere tells us is that we need to expand our idea of what counts as rational ,COMMA and we need to expand our simple equation of value equals money ,COMMA or ,COMMA you have to pay for it to be good ,COMMA but that in fact you can end up with collectively really brilliant products without any money at all changing hands .PERIOD <BREAK>
then along comes crack cocaine .PERIOD <BREAK>
you transported the bones out yourself to the coast of africa ,COMMA onto a boat ,COMMA if you wanted to get them out of the middle of the sahara .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA let's just think about ,COMMA we got a problem here ,COMMA we need to reboot .PERIOD <BREAK>
i want you to look at the author's book and say ,COMMA wow !EXCLAMATIONMARK i need to read that .PERIOD <BREAK>
africans can't possibly really be using fractal geometry ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
it confused me ;SEMICOLON why did these allergy symptoms persist well past the pollen season ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
but then after they stared for a long time ,COMMA they would just give her the crackers ,COMMA what they thought everybody must like .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the answer is :COLON nothing .PERIOD there's nothing in it for the ant .PERIOD <BREAK>
these are images that come from hanna damasio's lab ,COMMA and which show you ,COMMA in a living brain ,COMMA the reconstruction of that brain .PERIOD <BREAK>
this was not a devastating stroke ,COMMA but it did affect his speaking and so forth .PERIOD <BREAK>
no doctor ,COMMA can i remember ,COMMA ever asking me ,COMMA where have you lived ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
while i was in easter island ,COMMA comet mcnaught was there also ,COMMA so you get a gratuitous picture of a moai with a comet .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i was thrilled .PERIOD <BREAK>
so again ,COMMA the notion that a building should just be explicit i think is a false notion ,COMMA which has reduced architecture into banality .PERIOD <BREAK>
capacity :COLON we have <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> times more spectrum ,COMMA <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> times more leds installed already in the infrastructure there .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it particularly don't feed your spliff habit .PERIOD <BREAK>
we're crocheting a coral reef .PERIOD <BREAK>
you take the big problem and you break it down into smaller pieces and you start to attack that .PERIOD <BREAK>
it is an elevation of us beyond ourselves .PERIOD <BREAK>
so it's out in the middle of nowhere ,COMMA and you approach it .PERIOD <BREAK>
these are not people you want to have a beer with .PERIOD <BREAK>
it used to be the time where only kings wore a leopard skin ,COMMA but now throughout rituals and ceremonies ,COMMA traditional healers and ministers .PERIOD <BREAK>
you don't need a task force or a study group to buy flowers for your kids .PERIOD <BREAK>
you zoom in ,COMMA there are just four dna strands and they have little single-stranded bits on them that can bind to other tiles ,COMMA if they match .PERIOD <BREAK>
i'm one of the organizers of tedxkibera .PERIOD <BREAK>
my work actually took me through many countries ,COMMA and showed me a great part of the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
was she pregnant when she died ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
we could eliminate sugar across the board for all confectionary products and sodas ,COMMA and we can replace it with all-natural fresh fruit .PERIOD <BREAK>
though i should say that my son is best and is better than your children .PERIOD <BREAK>
that means those students are getting half the learning they're supposed to ,COMMA because if one child is disrupting the class no one can learn .PERIOD <BREAK>
and today ,COMMA you would see this inside the mine ,COMMA half a mile underground .PERIOD <BREAK>
take a blood sample and run it through a machine called a coulter counter .PERIOD <BREAK>
and their policy prescription is to make government more accountable ,COMMA focus on the capital markets ,COMMA invest ,COMMA don't give anything away .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's been obvious in my practice ,COMMA to me .PERIOD <BREAK>
now maybe this is what the map of the region might look like in <NUM> to <NUM> years .PERIOD <BREAK>
now we also talked about checking the box and the difficulty of taking action .PERIOD <BREAK>
and just last month the first fda-approved application was approved to allow radiologists to do actual reading on these sorts of devices .PERIOD <BREAK>
and we'll act as if it's just an unfortunate mistake we've made ,COMMA forgetting our pants on this cold january day .PERIOD <BREAK>
so they get it in about <NUM> minutes and those who require surgery ,COMMA are counseled ,COMMA and then there are buses waiting ,COMMA which will transport them to the base hospital .PERIOD <BREAK>
and this is my favorite line from the article .PERIOD <BREAK>
three years and two children later ,COMMA we raised this <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> -square-foot lace net .PERIOD <BREAK>
but the secular-minded people can be influenced by that .PERIOD <BREAK>
and our colleagues in washington ,COMMA d .PERIOD c .PERIOD <BREAK>
but we only looked at a handful of individuals at this point .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so there's actually a fourth thing that we have not get to ,COMMA that we won't see in the next <NUM> years ,COMMA or <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> days ,COMMA but i think that's where we're going to .PERIOD and as the internet of things -- where i'm linking directly to the particular things of my seat on the plane -- that that physical thing becomes part of the web .PERIOD <BREAK>
so the idea is :COLON how to integrate these flows in space ,COMMA over time and with the limited means you have .PERIOD <BREAK>
and incentives :COLON not just material ,COMMA but also non-material incentives .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA for example ,COMMA we could use truckers' purchases of fuel .PERIOD <BREAK>
no ,COMMA i'm sorry .PERIOD <BREAK>
i had never been surrounded by so many azungu ,COMMA white people .PERIOD <BREAK>
but somehow or another ,COMMA in the last couple of decades ,COMMA the land of the free has become a legal minefield .PERIOD <BREAK>
and although these walls look very different ,COMMA galois has produced a language to say that in fact the symmetries underlying these are exactly the same .PERIOD <BREAK>
you may have seen it .PERIOD <BREAK>
but actually going out to propagate that view is associated with either neoconservativism or with islamist extremism .PERIOD <BREAK>
and this is the fourth time ,COMMA and i come here for this wisdom ,COMMA i think .PERIOD <BREAK>
and he was slapping the stewardess and pinching her as she went by ,COMMA and everybody was upset with him .PERIOD <BREAK>
bruno giussani :COLON i'm told you did plug it in once .PERIOD <BREAK>

so what we've been doing a couple of years -- but last year was a big year -- is we started tagging sharks so we could try to get some idea of sight fidelity and movements and things like that .PERIOD <BREAK>
those side effects accumulate and eventually cause pathology .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA if i were to take the sun and compress it down to the scale of the university of oxford ,COMMA it would become a black hole .PERIOD <BREAK>
so i did a few prototypes .PERIOD i got a small little grant at stanford .PERIOD <BREAK>
isn't that a very expensive solution for a small maneuverable flying object ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
whether they're individuals or organizations ,COMMA we follow those who lead ,COMMA not because we have to ,COMMA but because we want to .PERIOD <BREAK>

this is lafayette avenue -- and as redesigned by matthews-nielsen landscape architects .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is our two interpreters ,COMMA sort of reading the architecture .PERIOD <BREAK>
so for example ,COMMA take the jewish idea of forgiveness .PERIOD <BREAK>

so ,COMMA from there to the world of real work .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's the same .PERIOD we need infrastructure ,COMMA infrastructure and discipline .PERIOD <BREAK>
these women ,COMMA many from small towns in india ,COMMA help keep the peace ,COMMA far away from home and family .PERIOD <BREAK>

they lack nutrients ,COMMA and diarrhea dehydrates them .PERIOD <BREAK>
then half of them announced their commitment to this goal to the room ,COMMA and half didn't .PERIOD <BREAK>
aging is basically a process that happens to inanimate objects like cars ,COMMA and it also happens to us ,COMMA despite the fact that we have a lot of clever self-repair mechanisms ,COMMA because those self-repair mechanisms are not perfect .PERIOD <BREAK>

how do you design that nozzle ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
people say ,COMMA what's the solution ?QUESTIONMARK here it is .PERIOD <BREAK>
i then went on to make more comments on the media and press imagery ,COMMA so i started making reference to media imagery -- made it grainy ,COMMA shot through doorways and so on and so forth -- to titillate the public or the viewer further in terms of trying to make the viewer more aware of their own voyeurism .PERIOD <BREAK>
the first was that i grew up with no religion at all .PERIOD <BREAK>
so anybody who's here today with your significant other ,COMMA just turn over to them and swab their mouth ,COMMA send it to the lab and you'll know for sure .PERIOD <BREAK>
he has a theory of how the overall clock experience should work .PERIOD <BREAK>
why i thought i was going to be able to do that ,COMMA i don't know .PERIOD <BREAK>

this is a picture of titan ,COMMA backlit by the sun ,COMMA with the rings as a beautiful backdrop .PERIOD <BREAK>
prior to world war ii ,COMMA they were making <NUM> planes a year .PERIOD <BREAK>
my speechwriters must have been tearing their hair out because as we worked between one and four in the morning on inauguration day ,COMMA i was still changing it .PERIOD <BREAK>
there isn't the technology to do that .PERIOD <BREAK>
but the fact that those dictators suppressed democracy in their country and suppressed islamic groups in their country actually made the islamists much more strident .PERIOD <BREAK>
because i love mobius loops .PERIOD i not only love mobius loops ,COMMA but i'm one of the very few people ,COMMA if not the only person in the world ,COMMA that makes klein bottles .PERIOD <BREAK>
then we lost our economy and we went back down to <NUM> -- sometimes it's <NUM> ,COMMA sometimes it's <NUM> .PERIOD <BREAK>
life adds information to matter .PERIOD <BREAK>
well ,COMMA here's the dirty little secret .PERIOD <BREAK>
that's all it is ,COMMA a bouncy castle .PERIOD <BREAK>

and i therefore believe that optimism is what drives architecture forward .PERIOD <BREAK>
i want to know about wrongness itself ,COMMA the idea of wrong .PERIOD <BREAK>
i just don't believe that .PERIOD <BREAK>
well ,COMMA i'd happened to have had a couple of drinks before boarding -- i do that to steel my nerves -- and so i imitate a train call ,COMMA holding my hand on my -- 'george orwell ,COMMA your time has come ,COMMA ' you see .PERIOD <BREAK>

you know ,COMMA think of our evolutionary predilection for eating sweet things ,COMMA fatty things like cheesecake .PERIOD <BREAK>
it tells a story .PERIOD the story can reach into obscure desires .PERIOD <BREAK>
so no surprises then that the proportion that actually used clean needles every time they injected in the last week is just about one in <NUM> ,COMMA and the other nine in <NUM> are sharing .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA there was a clear lesson here .PERIOD <BREAK>
but many of you have said ,COMMA if you get these marine protected areas ,COMMA or a reasonable regime for high seas fisheries management in place ,COMMA how are you going to enforce it ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
until then ,COMMA cancer was the zodiac sign of my friend ,COMMA stage was what i performed on ,COMMA and grades were what i got in school .PERIOD <BREAK>

they're everywhere .PERIOD they're all over the place .PERIOD <BREAK>
here's another crowd in mecca .PERIOD <BREAK>
jeremy bentham ,COMMA the great utilitarian philosopher ,COMMA once spiked this argument .PERIOD <BREAK>

you can go to the museum of hollywood history in hollywood and see max factor's special rooms that he painted different colors depending on the complexion of the star he was going to make up .PERIOD <BREAK>
do people have grid cells ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and if you go out to that line of trees at the far end ,COMMA you'll see what the valley used to look like .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is where all your decision-making processes are going on .PERIOD <BREAK>
many of you have probably used this .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i mean ,COMMA in the original it's completely unclear to see what this tangle of colors and shapes is supposed to depict .PERIOD <BREAK>
snow lived near there ,COMMA heard about the outbreak ,COMMA and in this amazing act of courage went directly into the belly of the beast because he thought an outbreak that concentrated could actually potentially end up convincing people that ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA the real menace of cholera was in the water supply and not in the air .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i want to call your attention to some of the side effects of going the institutional route .PERIOD <BREAK>
what i do is i write books about the cultural history of physics .PERIOD <BREAK>
i'm talking about opec oil .PERIOD <BREAK>
and this is where we're actually going .PERIOD <BREAK>
so the nice thing was is he walked by his daughter's room at some point ,COMMA and she actually was singing that song to herself .PERIOD <BREAK>
by about <NUM> ,COMMA some scientists were sitting around and they thought ,COMMA what in the world ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>

i want to wipe the smudges clean .PERIOD <BREAK>
but then in the last two years ,COMMA it goes up again to <NUM> percent ,COMMA indicating a rising living cost .PERIOD <BREAK>
so let me first start with the personal reason .PERIOD <BREAK>
they have located two consultants ,COMMA frank wilson and nate johnson ,COMMA who are -- frank wilson is a neurologist ,COMMA nate johnson is a mechanic .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA i'm thinking about ,COMMA how can we generalize the way we make all sorts of things ,COMMA so you end up with this sort of guy ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
that's <NUM> a .PERIOD m .PERIOD shadows .PERIOD <BREAK>
every single thing which you have learned in the past <NUM> years of swimming ,COMMA you must forget .PERIOD <BREAK>
for instance ,COMMA i stumbled across this advertisement outside the women's washroom in the kansas city airport .PERIOD <BREAK>

i thought it was a <NUM> to <NUM> year problem .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's built up of a huge number of these little tiny filaments of vibrating energy ,COMMA vibrating in different frequencies .PERIOD <BREAK>
sure enough ,COMMA we all buy into that ,COMMA and with gated communities ,COMMA we have a formalized expectation with a homeowners association .PERIOD <BREAK>
i'll just give you one example because time is racing .PERIOD <BREAK>
is this science fiction ?QUESTIONMARK no ,COMMA because i'm wearing the first application of this technology .PERIOD <BREAK>
so it’s a leap of imagination .PERIOD <BREAK>
it was sold to proto-feminist housewives as a way to cut down on housework .PERIOD <BREAK>
henriapi illustrates this phenomenon as well .PERIOD <BREAK>
so if we want to find a better way of doing that kind of work ,COMMA we need look only no farther than africa to find these robust self-organizing algorithms .PERIOD <BREAK>
now this is the part of the nervous system that deals with the things that we don't consciously control ,COMMA like digestion ,COMMA heart rate and sexual arousal .PERIOD <BREAK>
they can put it in an envelope and mail it to you ,COMMA and then say in no uncertain terms ,COMMA please cut that out .PERIOD <BREAK>
as removed as we the dominant society may feel from a massacre in <NUM> ,COMMA or a series of broken treaties <NUM> years ago ,COMMA i still have to ask you the question ,COMMA how should you feel about the statistics of today ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
so the final point here is that to understand how wikipedia works ,COMMA it's important to understand that our wiki model is the way we work ,COMMA but we are not fanatical web anarchists .PERIOD in fact ,COMMA we're very flexible about the social methodology ,COMMA because it's ultimately the passion of the community is for the quality of the work ,COMMA not necessarily for the process that we use to generate it .PERIOD <BREAK>
now let's try to put this into a little bit of context .PERIOD <BREAK>
psychologists have known about the negative consequences of incentivizing everything for <NUM> years .PERIOD <BREAK>
and that seems to be the general picture -- that greater equality makes most difference at the bottom ,COMMA but has some benefits even at the top .PERIOD <BREAK>
she said she actually saw the person run out who she thinks stole whatever the jewelry was ,COMMA but the police came ,COMMA they got her ,COMMA there was nothing on her .PERIOD <BREAK>
chris anderson :COLON stop .PERIOD i've got two questions .PERIOD <BREAK>

in fact ,COMMA when i start running around saying ,COMMA hey ,COMMA boys and girls ,COMMA you're cardiologists in the u .PERIOD s .PERIOD can you come home with me and do a mission ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
he wrote ,COMMA the universe cannot be read until we have learnt the language and become familiar with the characters in which it is written .PERIOD <BREAK>
there are a lot of really neat ,COMMA very good robotic hands out there in the market .PERIOD <BREAK>
this woman told me it was in the nick of time .PERIOD <BREAK>
and their wish would then be brought to a priest ,COMMA who would find a ritual object ,COMMA and the appropriate sacrifices would be made ,COMMA and the shrine would be built for the god .PERIOD <BREAK>
and ,COMMA you know ,COMMA after keeping these books for a number of years ,COMMA i started to become very interested in collecting not only my own personal artifacts ,COMMA but also the artifacts of other people .PERIOD <BREAK>
like ,COMMA take ,COMMA for instance ,COMMA your pacemaker cells in your heart right now .PERIOD <BREAK>
why do we respond so much to our knowledge of where something comes from ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
most of the time ,COMMA you want to print one copy of your document ,COMMA in page order ,COMMA on that printer .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i want to say that i think we're on the path of understanding metabolic flexibility in a fundamental way ,COMMA and that in the not too distant future ,COMMA an emt might give an injection of hydrogen sulfide ,COMMA or some related compound ,COMMA to a person suffering severe injuries ,COMMA and that person might de-animate a bit ,COMMA they might become a little more immortal .PERIOD <BREAK>
and when he passed on ,COMMA i took this table with me and brought it to my office ,COMMA and it reminds me of him .PERIOD <BREAK>
but to see something like the $ <NUM> computer is amazing ,COMMA because it's a -- blogging software is simple .PERIOD <BREAK>
we could talk about a kind of soul ,COMMA of a ghost compelling them .PERIOD <BREAK>
maybe you've encountered the zero-to-three movement ,COMMA which asserts that the most important years for learning are the earliest ones .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's our ability to write things down ,COMMA our language and our consciousness .PERIOD <BREAK>
we've got the military -- have just deployed some of these into iraq ,COMMA where you can put fake troop movements quarter of a mile away on a hillside .PERIOD <BREAK>
so i thought ,COMMA okay ,COMMA i'll start with five .PERIOD <BREAK>
when i heard about the vanishing bees ,COMMA colony collapse disorder ,COMMA it motivated me to take action .PERIOD <BREAK>
some of the greatest innovations and developments in the world often happen at the intersection of two fields .PERIOD <BREAK>
one of the things i want you to note from it is blood -- that you see a tremendous amount of blood contact .PERIOD <BREAK>
the door opened .PERIOD this guy jumped out .PERIOD he's about that tall .PERIOD he said ,COMMA hi ,COMMA my name is troy .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i came from a very privileged background .PERIOD i was very lucky .PERIOD <BREAK>

he's been suffering from a right hip pain for a while .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the glass -- luckily i turned around -- i had it all in my back and i was about <NUM> feet away .PERIOD <BREAK>
we ended up having to make it a sculpture ,COMMA because the dilemma was ,COMMA how do you build a building that doesn't look like the language ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and you can probably think of many ,COMMA many more in your own everyday lives .PERIOD <BREAK>
and you can see here ,COMMA he's starting to get more energy into the frontal lobe .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i asked millions of people ,COMMA without questioning my right to do so ,COMMA to go up against the government .PERIOD <BREAK>
but in fact ,COMMA emotions are an all-systems alert that change what we remember ,COMMA what kind of decisions we make ,COMMA and how we perceive things .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i tried to come up for air ,COMMA and my lower back hit the bottom of the inner tube .PERIOD <BREAK>
i learned it when i was four at my mother's knee .PERIOD <BREAK>
so we figured out some pretty interesting ways to track co <NUM> levels in the atmosphere ,COMMA going back millions of years .PERIOD <BREAK>
the challenge there with a breathing and awake patient -- and in all our treatments ,COMMA the patient is awake and conscious and speaks with the physician -- is you have to teach the mr some tricks how to do it in real time .PERIOD <BREAK>
your iphone ,COMMA your laptop ,COMMA is much more handy than new york times on sunday .PERIOD <BREAK>
and what we have here -- can everyone see <NUM> purple surfaces on your left ,COMMA and <NUM> ,COMMA call it yellowish ,COMMA surfaces on your right ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
you know ,COMMA eight hours before deadline ,COMMA four architects trying to get this building in on time ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
so when i was a little girl ,COMMA i had a couple of very strange habits .PERIOD <BREAK>

other people couldn't get the machine running .PERIOD it always worked for him .PERIOD <BREAK>
each one has his story .PERIOD <BREAK>
architects tend to work with signature ,COMMA so that an architect needs a signature and that signature has to work across the scale of houses up to ,COMMA say ,COMMA skyscrapers ,COMMA and that problem of signatures is a thing we're very good at maintaining and working with ;SEMICOLON and intricacy ,COMMA which is the relationship of ,COMMA say ,COMMA the shape of a building ,COMMA its structure ,COMMA its windows ,COMMA its color ,COMMA its pattern .PERIOD these are real architectural problems .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it's not just stewardship and dominion debate ,COMMA because really ,COMMA dominion is implicit in stewardship -- because how could you dominate something you had killed ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
i -- you know ,COMMA when i -- after i had invented pcr ,COMMA i kind of needed a change .PERIOD <BREAK>
we don't see scenes like this anymore because of vaccines .PERIOD <BREAK>
what i and my colleagues did was put <NUM> people ,COMMA who were madly in love ,COMMA into a functional mri brain scanner .PERIOD <BREAK>
these things ,COMMA they teach through .PERIOD <BREAK>
so it brings me to my main take-home message ,COMMA which is we can avert a tragedy of the commons .PERIOD <BREAK>
most of them explode spontaneously in contact with air ,COMMA and when you call up the companies ,COMMA they only give you minimum ten tons ,COMMA ok ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
are you going to compete ?QUESTIONMARK no .PERIOD no one's going to win this thing .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA there is the building ,COMMA there is what we call the draw .PERIOD <BREAK>
now this is the neurological goldmine ,COMMA if you like ,COMMA because a known reward excites people ,COMMA but what really gets them going is the uncertain reward ,COMMA the reward pitched at the right level of uncertainty ,COMMA that they didn't quite know whether they were going to get it or not .PERIOD <BREAK>
and for every hundred dollars ,COMMA you get almost <NUM> extra years of education .PERIOD <BREAK>
now ,COMMA the third system is product-service systems .PERIOD <BREAK>
and of course ,COMMA today ,COMMA with the technology of the computer and with the rapid prototyping ,COMMA etc .PERIOD we have the mechanisms to understand and to respond to these systems ,COMMA and to allow them to adjust to the various accommodations of functionalities because that's all we do .PERIOD <BREAK>
i know now her life was hard ;SEMICOLON she lost three children as babies ,COMMA then her husband died too ,COMMA leaving young sons ,COMMA and no money .PERIOD <BREAK>
this was an injured urethra on the left side .PERIOD <BREAK>
wait for the man with the mockingbird .PERIOD <BREAK>

because archaeology gives us an opportunity to study past civilizations ,COMMA and see where they succeeded and where they failed .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i took a lot of pictures last year ;SEMICOLON very few people knew what i was up to ,COMMA but i took a lot of pictures .PERIOD <BREAK>
wouldn't it be cool if every time you listened ,COMMA it could be different ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>

it comes back at times of great transformation ,COMMA globalization being one of those transformations .PERIOD <BREAK>
we were asked in the past when we bought an electric car to pay for the entire well ,COMMA for the life of the car .PERIOD <BREAK>
okay ,COMMA now getting to a part -- i want to show design in illusions .PERIOD i believe that the first example of illusions being used purposely was by da vinci in this anamorphic image of an eye .PERIOD so that when you saw from one little angle was like this .PERIOD and this little technique got popular in the <NUM> th century and the <NUM> th century to disguise hidden meanings ,COMMA where you could flip the image and see it from one little point of view like this .PERIOD <BREAK>
and high among them is education ,COMMA because education ,COMMA in a way ,COMMA dislocates very many people from their natural talents .PERIOD <BREAK>
there's no ice over it .PERIOD <BREAK>
there are a couple of things going on right now that i want to bring to your attention .PERIOD <BREAK>

moral ambiguity takes off .PERIOD <BREAK>
the clientele behavior was very much the same too .PERIOD <BREAK>
because if you can live in radiation that looks like this ,COMMA that brings up a whole series of interesting questions .PERIOD <BREAK>
even though she is much richer than any of you are .PERIOD <BREAK>
there's not really a lot of community support around it .PERIOD <BREAK>

seven million ship cargo containers come into the united states every year .PERIOD <BREAK>

and then someone asked me ,COMMA just before my tedtalk ,COMMA a few days ago ,COMMA so where is the hope ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
chris anderson :COLON now this is actually a courageous talk ,COMMA because you're kind of setting up yourself in some ways to be ridiculed in some quarters .PERIOD <BREAK>

there's no audio on this ,COMMA but you can see the animal's freezing .PERIOD <BREAK>
i think a world that was run where half of our countries and half of our companies were run by women ,COMMA would be a better world .PERIOD <BREAK>

he said ,COMMA you know ,COMMA you've been so nice ,COMMA let's split the reward .PERIOD <BREAK>
so part of it is like a baseball glove .PERIOD <BREAK>
we have seen lateral shifts of power -- the power of greece passed to rome and the power shifts that occurred during the european civilizations -- but we are seeing something slightly different .PERIOD <BREAK>
the best a .PERIOD i .PERIOD in the planet would find it complex and confusing ,COMMA and my little dog watson would find it simple and understandable but would miss the point .PERIOD <BREAK>

they start to make not only commercial marketing decisions ,COMMA but also planting decisions ,COMMA on the basis of information coming from the futures price market .PERIOD <BREAK>

that was what the conclusion of the dartmouth atlas of healthcare was about ,COMMA was saying that we can explain the geographic variations that occur in disease ,COMMA in illness ,COMMA in wellness ,COMMA and how our healthcare system actually operates .PERIOD <BREAK>

technically the riaa can come and persecute you .PERIOD <BREAK>

there is actually a scientist here at oxford who studied this ,COMMA andrew parker .PERIOD <BREAK>

they were delighted ,COMMA and by the time it was time to go see the principal ,COMMA whom they'd actually come to see -- not the computer room -- they went upstairs and they said ,COMMA this is absolutely remarkable !EXCLAMATIONMARK <BREAK>
because commercial companies are inherently designed to get as much out of you [as] they can get away with .PERIOD <BREAK>
actually this creature is the result of the penfield research .PERIOD <BREAK>
and this is a burglar alarm .PERIOD <BREAK>
so it's a really nice analog for all sorts of environmental issues ,COMMA where we're asking people to make a sacrifice and they themselves don't really benefit from their own sacrifice .PERIOD <BREAK>
now the display on your laptop costs ,COMMA in rough numbers ,COMMA <NUM> dollars a diagonal inch .PERIOD <BREAK>

so they go into a meeting room ,COMMA they get together ,COMMA and they talk about stuff that doesn't really matter usually .PERIOD <BREAK>
but that's what we're going to do .PERIOD <BREAK>
that was the most scary thing i've ever done in my life !EXCLAMATIONMARK <BREAK>

if you've heard about the mayan <NUM> apocalypse ,COMMA you're going to hear about apophis ,COMMA because you're keyed in to all the doomsday networks anyway .PERIOD <BREAK>

millions of people have contributed their desktop computers when they're not using them to link together through the internet into supercomputing collectives that help solve the protein folding problem for medical researchers -- that's folding@home at stanford -- to crack codes ,COMMA to search for life in outer space .PERIOD <BREAK>

so i decided to get engaged ,COMMA and the first thing that i did was to come back to ghana and talk with a lot of people and really try to understand what the real issues were .PERIOD <BREAK>
i want to close by showing you a videotape that's a version of a future game in the rockett series that our graphic artists and design people put together ,COMMA that we feel would please that four percent of reviewers .PERIOD <BREAK>

charley :COLON i'll stick to my original thesis .PERIOD <BREAK>
between them ,COMMA these new revenue flows dwarf aid .PERIOD <BREAK>

e :COLON so you too must stand trial then .PERIOD <BREAK>
and we consume so much that again ,COMMA a rise of <NUM> .PERIOD <NUM> billion to <NUM> .PERIOD <NUM> billion in our grandchildren's lifetime will disproportionately hurt the poorest and the most vulnerable .PERIOD <BREAK>

this is to mimic the weight of the boar .PERIOD <BREAK>
when the sunlight comes through the window you see these little fibers .PERIOD <BREAK>

we have got to develop the idea that the earth doesn't last forever ,COMMA our sun doesn't last forever .PERIOD <BREAK>
now the easiest analogy for swap-trading is like an online dating service for all your unwanted media .PERIOD <BREAK>
and this leads to the second bias ,COMMA which economists have called loss aversion .PERIOD <BREAK>
and one of the profound things that happened was this act of actually connecting to all these people .PERIOD <BREAK>
we have to utilize this day of ceasefire and nonviolence and go for a global truce ,COMMA go for the largest recorded cessation of hostilities ,COMMA both domestically and internationally ,COMMA ever recorded .PERIOD <BREAK>
maybe pulling bits off ?QUESTIONMARK i'm not asking about that .PERIOD <BREAK>
and then they said to the physician ,COMMA you decided a few weeks ago that nothing is working for this patient .PERIOD <BREAK>
in fact ,COMMA if i just connect back to our lab systems through the web ,COMMA we can see in real time just some kind of idea of how many viruses ,COMMA how many new examples of malware we find every single day .PERIOD <BREAK>
the camera is always on .PERIOD <BREAK>
you cannot be constrained by the public's opinion .PERIOD <BREAK>
the other thing is to actually give you two solutions for the price of one ;SEMICOLON you get the big one and if you don't like that ,COMMA how about the little one ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
so i want you to meet three of our students .PERIOD <BREAK>
it empowered authorities ,COMMA and ,COMMA as a result ,COMMA marginalized citizens .PERIOD <BREAK>
not because you force them to do something against their will ,COMMA but because they wanted to connect .PERIOD <BREAK>
these individuals are at specific risk ,COMMA particularly if there's blood contact ,COMMA they're at risk for transmission and possibly infection with novel viruses .PERIOD <BREAK>

what can we do to the mosquito ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
its closest relative is ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA from mice ,COMMA and so we would call this a xenotropic retrovirus ,COMMA because it's infecting a species other than mice .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is a very embarrassing talk ,COMMA i know .PERIOD <BREAK>
the baby was delivered through a c-section ,COMMA but barbara suffered cerebral anoxia ,COMMA a loss of oxygen to the brain .PERIOD <BREAK>

she's only <NUM> years old ,COMMA and she's not dazzled by anything .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's about <NUM> feet wide ,COMMA the size of a football field ,COMMA and it sits on just four very delicate columns .PERIOD <BREAK>
but some plants are manipulating animals ,COMMA like in the case of orchids that promise sex and nectar and give in change nothing for the transportation of the pollen .PERIOD <BREAK>
no need to be .PERIOD there's nothing wrong with old age .PERIOD <BREAK>
and once you make these ,COMMA you make a little house .PERIOD <BREAK>
and as we thought about it more ,COMMA we realized that it let you fill in all the details about the experience ,COMMA just as if you saw it on tv .PERIOD so ,COMMA for ted we decided to take our favorite idea for the gel magnet and work with roman and his team at the directors bureau to create a commercial for a product from the future .PERIOD <BREAK>
you don't see the other side of me .PERIOD <BREAK>
and when noah had done built his ark .PERIOD <BREAK>

my archive :COLON <NUM> films ,COMMA my <NUM> -millimeter negative ,COMMA all my books ,COMMA my dad's books ,COMMA my photographs .PERIOD <BREAK>

but this has not stopped diane von furstenberg .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA again ,COMMA we were asked to design a water pump for a company called approtec ,COMMA in kenya .PERIOD <BREAK>
so you can see that if you actually found one that was <NUM> percent grown and you didn't know that it was going to grow up to a cassowary ,COMMA you would think they were two different animals .PERIOD <BREAK>
perhaps most exciting to me is an idea that bill gates ,COMMA howard buffett and others have supported boldly ,COMMA which is to ask the question :COLON what if ,COMMA instead of looking at the hungry as victims -- and most of them are small farmers who cannot raise enough food or sell food to even support their own families -- what if we view them as the solution ,COMMA as the value chain to fight hunger ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and that's because he was in a special court .PERIOD <BREAK>

i didn't see either of the planes hit ,COMMA and when i glanced out my window ,COMMA i saw the first tower burning ,COMMA and i thought it might have been an accident .PERIOD <BREAK>
and in particular ,COMMA i think we can learn things about learning .PERIOD <BREAK>
or can you move beyond my veil and see me for who i truly am inside ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
so the little poem is called the dead .PERIOD <BREAK>
here is what happens .PERIOD <BREAK>
but this is a nice ,COMMA slender ,COMMA very bad pest .PERIOD <BREAK>
and we have plenty of energy ,COMMA so we'll solve that problem ,COMMA but the biology problem's tricky ,COMMA because as we put through all these toxic materials that we disgorge ,COMMA we will never be able to recover that .PERIOD <BREAK>
you can take a data set and put it there .PERIOD <BREAK>
uh ,COMMA well ,COMMA thank you .PERIOD <BREAK>
every village in africa now has a cyber cafe .PERIOD <BREAK>

to give you a sense of the speed ,COMMA the scale :COLON the computer is just so amazingly fast ,COMMA o .PERIOD k .PERIOD <BREAK>

most of them learn how to operate a telephone within a day .PERIOD <BREAK>

what the entertainment business is struggling with ,COMMA the world of brands is figuring out .PERIOD <BREAK>
i hadn't dealt with this kind of problem or frankly ,COMMA this whole segment of the medical world .PERIOD <BREAK>
and you've got to wage war here in such a way to facilitate that .PERIOD <BREAK>
we should be able to make that choice easier for them to get toward the legitimate world ,COMMA because if we don't ,COMMA they will go toward the criminal world .PERIOD <BREAK>
so i'm thinking how can i do this ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
the fund was deposited as a family reassure ,COMMA in a safe ,COMMA reliable security company in dakar ,COMMA senegal ,COMMA where i was only given temporary asylum .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's a sizable chunk of human culture .PERIOD <BREAK>

several studios are using this software now to produce virtual stuntmen ,COMMA and they're going to hit the screen quite soon ,COMMA actually ,COMMA for some major productions .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's the females ,COMMA i think ,COMMA that lay the eggs ,COMMA and then the males fertilize them .PERIOD <BREAK>

well ,COMMA i hate to break it to you ,COMMA those aren't other body parts controlling your behavior .PERIOD <BREAK>

we brought musicians to the canopy ,COMMA and they made their music -- and it's fantastic music .PERIOD <BREAK>
we got the results from that for the optimal engine .PERIOD <BREAK>
the magazines started to cover it .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's a richer experience .PERIOD <BREAK>
we have students who sit together ,COMMA black kids and white kids ,COMMA and what we've discovered is you can solve the race problem by creating a world class environment ,COMMA because people will have a tendency to show you world class behavior if you treat them in that way .PERIOD <BREAK>
here it goes .PERIOD <BREAK>
well ,COMMA i understand the genetics and lifestyle part .PERIOD <BREAK>
no ,COMMA not potatoes ,COMMA but tomatoes ,COMMA aromatic plants and so on .PERIOD <BREAK>

it is so important when we're communicating big ideas -- but especially a big spiritual idea like compassion -- to root it as we present it to others in space and time and flesh and blood -- the color and complexity of life .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's more like that .PERIOD <BREAK>
so i'm not going to go on until every single person in this room ,COMMA downstairs and in aspen ,COMMA and everybody else looking ,COMMA will come to love and understand classical music .PERIOD <BREAK>
but let's just think through what the science is telling us is likely to happen .PERIOD <BREAK>
once you tell me you would like to save more in the future ,COMMA let's say every january you're going to be saving more automatically and it's going to go away from your paycheck to the <NUM> plan before you see it ,COMMA before you touch it ,COMMA before you get the issue of immediate gratification .PERIOD <BREAK>

but that's okay .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i just wanted to play it for you .PERIOD <BREAK>
we're now working on some work where we're trying to tile the brain with recording elements too .PERIOD <BREAK>

every time a new consumer joins this media landscape a new producer joins as well ,COMMA because the same equipment -- phones ,COMMA computers -- let you consume and produce .PERIOD <BREAK>

so after the interaction ,COMMA we asked people to rate their quality of interaction with the technology ,COMMA with a remote collaborator through this technology ,COMMA in a number of different ways .PERIOD <BREAK>
my first love .PERIOD <BREAK>
stanley was instrumental in my getting this job .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's being managed by a singaporean-based management company .PERIOD <BREAK>
unfortunately ,COMMA ocean rowboats very rarely go in a straight line .PERIOD <BREAK>
we need lots more .PERIOD <BREAK>
but it turns out ,COMMA what social scientists are actually learning is that most of us ,COMMA when put in certain contexts ,COMMA will actually make very specific mistakes .PERIOD <BREAK>
but when the american parents were asked if they would rather have had the doctors make the decision ,COMMA they all said ,COMMA no .PERIOD <BREAK>
the big image is our story ,COMMA our poetry ,COMMA our romanticism .PERIOD <BREAK>

it's not different ,COMMA it's the same stuff :COLON calcium carbonate ,COMMA calcium carbonate .PERIOD <BREAK>
then ,COMMA if in that framework ,COMMA you take a bunch of theoreticians .PERIOD <BREAK>

we visit kibbutzim that were established by holocaust survivors .PERIOD <BREAK>

you've all had this experience .PERIOD <BREAK>

and i think that we are capable of taking on that obligation ,COMMA but only if we put what we can into it .PERIOD <BREAK>
now ,COMMA let your imagination go upward into space .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i would travel in a c- <NUM> transport and go and visit warlords in mountain hideaways and negotiate with them about how we were going to eradicate al qaeda from afghanistan ,COMMA surrounded by my special forces escort ,COMMA who ,COMMA themselves ,COMMA had to have an escort of a platoon of royal marines ,COMMA because it was so dangerous .PERIOD <BREAK>

and the results of that are kids getting sick .PERIOD <BREAK>
those learning it think it's disconnected ,COMMA uninteresting and hard .PERIOD <BREAK>
they've lived in italy for a number of years .PERIOD <BREAK>
that by focusing on the needs of humans and by using prototypes to move ideas along quickly ,COMMA by getting the process out of the hands of designers ,COMMA and by getting the active participation of the community ,COMMA we can tackle bigger and more interesting questions .PERIOD <BREAK>
now ,COMMA this is wonderful ,COMMA because the campaign promise of large telescopes is that is that the bigger the telescope ,COMMA the smaller the detail that we can see .PERIOD <BREAK>

this is all about self-interest that adds up to more .PERIOD <BREAK>
what we look for in firemen ,COMMA in climbers ,COMMA in policemen ,COMMA and what we should look for in intervention ,COMMA is intelligent risk takers -- not people who plunge blind off a cliff ,COMMA not people who jump into a burning room ,COMMA but who weigh their risks ,COMMA weigh their responsibilities .PERIOD <BREAK>

it is a homeostatic imbalance .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA as we have faced liability ,COMMA we have stepped back and back ,COMMA and unfortunately ,COMMA where there is liability ,COMMA guess what there is :COLON power .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA this is sold as cow ,COMMA but what happens when you slaughter a cow -- at least in industrial factory farming -- they have all these little bits of steak left that they can't actually sell as steak ,COMMA so what they do is they glue them all together with fibrin from pig blood into this really large sausage ,COMMA then freeze the sausage ,COMMA cut it in little slices and sell those as steak again .PERIOD <BREAK>

he really meant it .PERIOD <BREAK>
but the idea was that at one point i did a project called facebook me equals you ,COMMA where i wanted to experience what it was like to live as another person .PERIOD <BREAK>

the good news is i'm very aware of my responsibilities to get you out of here because i'm the only thing standing between you and the bar .PERIOD <BREAK>

i get chills every time i see that .PERIOD <BREAK>

they're team teaching .PERIOD they're constantly improving their teachers .PERIOD <BREAK>
having a little bit of richard time .PERIOD that's nice ,COMMA that's good .PERIOD <BREAK>
but the science that's coming back from all of these laboratories about the use of this molecule has provided us insights that we might not have had on our own .PERIOD <BREAK>
and you're thinking ,COMMA my god ,COMMA these christians are coming to kill us .PERIOD <BREAK>
and you see ,COMMA everybody's busy .PERIOD there was no time to waste .PERIOD <BREAK>
and in that moment of desire and focus ,COMMA he can win .PERIOD <BREAK>

inanimate objects that might spontaneously synchronize themselves .PERIOD <BREAK>
you're flying through the cortex of my colleague's brain .PERIOD <BREAK>
but it goes down below ground many stories .PERIOD <BREAK>
they didn't help at all .PERIOD <BREAK>
now we have a dancing protocell and a self-replication event .PERIOD right .PERIOD <BREAK>
the tracks are elevated about eight feet from the waterline normally ,COMMA but at that point the water had receded to a level three or four feet below normal .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it actually -- so technologically ,COMMA it works .PERIOD <BREAK>
we urgently need to change this .PERIOD <BREAK>

you see a filament ,COMMA you see the light is the invisible matter ,COMMA and the yellow is the stars or the galaxies showing up .PERIOD <BREAK>
how does it do it ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
how do the rules give rise to the patterns ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and we have a sense that it's everyone of us that is experiencing this -- not the person who is sitting next to you .PERIOD <BREAK>
there is italian chinese food ,COMMA where they don't have fortune cookies ,COMMA so they serve fried gelato .PERIOD <BREAK>
suppose we've got a group of little organisms -- they can be bacteria ,COMMA they can be hamsters ;SEMICOLON it doesn't matter what -- and let's suppose that this little group here ,COMMA they evolved to be cooperative .PERIOD <BREAK>

and do you know where the operating room is ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
by the way ,COMMA i do make it look a little bit easier than it is .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it was really terrific .PERIOD <BREAK>
so anyway ,COMMA we found activity in three brain regions .PERIOD <BREAK>
well ,COMMA throughout the world ,COMMA if we look at the lights at night ,COMMA the one thing that's misleading is that ,COMMA visually ,COMMA it looks like most of the world is already built out .PERIOD <BREAK>
if it has this sublinear scaling ,COMMA the theory says we should have sigmoidal growth .PERIOD <BREAK>
and that really ,COMMA really excites me .PERIOD <BREAK>
the choice is whether certain facts about humans ,COMMA or topics ,COMMA are to be considered taboos ,COMMA forbidden knowledge ,COMMA where we shouldn't go there because no good can come from it ,COMMA or whether we should explore them honestly .PERIOD <BREAK>
as you can see ,COMMA it's got lots and lots of minerals dissolved in it .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i'd be wrong to dis that completely .PERIOD <BREAK>
so i'll end with the new version .PERIOD <BREAK>
it may be possible that we are not even able to build that much clean energy .PERIOD <BREAK>
so you can stop staring at me .PERIOD <BREAK>
and he lost his lower jaw ,COMMA his lip ,COMMA his chin and his upper jaw and teeth .PERIOD <BREAK>

as plato said ,COMMA what space is to size ,COMMA time is to value .PERIOD <BREAK>

ok .PERIOD and what we're going to do is we're going to immerse ourselves in my world .PERIOD <BREAK>
that reaches <NUM> kilometers into the sky .PERIOD <BREAK>
but our homemade play-dough actually has half the resistance of commercial play-doh .PERIOD <BREAK>
subsequent to that ,COMMA after it's been going for about a year now ,COMMA they actually started to lease and create and extend .PERIOD <BREAK>

it's an autopilot .PERIOD <BREAK>
i had two undergraduate students at california institute of technology that worked with me .PERIOD <BREAK>
this little beast ,COMMA right now ,COMMA is producing a few hundred watts of electricity .PERIOD <BREAK>
so it's not simply looking at the quality or ,COMMA if you will ,COMMA the luxury of that interface ,COMMA but it's actually looking at the idea of presenting things that previously couldn't be presented before .PERIOD <BREAK>
but there were <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> emails and ims and text messages that i was able to save .PERIOD <BREAK>

with a screen it could inform people or show them around in a fun and entertaining way .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's a lot of traditional imposing coming by authority figures such as the men ,COMMA the grandparents and so on .PERIOD <BREAK>
so it turns out there was a company across the river called google who had started a digitization project a few years back that might just enable this approach .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it wasn't just to that wine .PERIOD <BREAK>
i'm adding that to my time .PERIOD <BREAK>
wat ,COMMA wait .PERIOD just hold this for me .PERIOD <BREAK>

stuck in traffic .PERIOD i'll be there soon .PERIOD <BREAK>
you can look at color ,COMMA and sizes ,COMMA and how it appeared on the runway ,COMMA or whatever .PERIOD <BREAK>

and they trained <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> bombardiers on how to use them -- long extensive ,COMMA months-long training sessions -- because these things are essentially analog computers ;SEMICOLON they're not easy to use .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i borrowed these three ipods from people here in the audience to show you what i mean .PERIOD <BREAK>
a couple of times i crossed the front line in the very place where mahmoud and his son were crossing .PERIOD <BREAK>

the lowest number of combatant casualties occurred in <NUM> ,COMMA with just <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> killed .PERIOD <BREAK>
they've got every feature known to man in there ,COMMA because adding a new feature is just software .PERIOD <BREAK>
as long as it's fun and it seems like it's going to be a funny idea and it seems like the people who witness it will also have a fun time ,COMMA then that's enough for us .PERIOD <BREAK>
for example ,COMMA i took a whole bunch of fortune cookies back to china ,COMMA gave them to chinese to see how they would react .PERIOD <BREAK>
battelle laboratories and i joined up in bellingham ,COMMA washington .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's not about them ,COMMA they know that ,COMMA but it has to start with them .PERIOD <BREAK>

in stage two ,COMMA we add water and salt to it ,COMMA mix it together ,COMMA and we create something that we call clay .PERIOD <BREAK>
i'm not telling you that story .PERIOD <BREAK>
the business model in which the money that is actually coming in ,COMMA to drive the car -- the minutes ,COMMA the miles if you want ,COMMA that you are all familiar with -- subsidize the price of the car ,COMMA just like cellphones .PERIOD you'll pay for the miles .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so it gets down to the brain .PERIOD <BREAK>
so you photograph that in exactly the same position ,COMMA and then you can substitute in -- and that part does use photoshop -- just the edges .PERIOD <BREAK>
i just couldn't believe how many things you can get here .PERIOD <BREAK>
you're beginning to see the emergence of a multi-polar world .PERIOD <BREAK>
and believe me ,COMMA i lived the same sad life until about three years ago .PERIOD <BREAK>
in a way ,COMMA i've got some bad news ,COMMA particularly to anybody who's come to oxford from abroad .PERIOD <BREAK>
this particular tunnel is interesting because it shows the original foundations of bloomingdale insane asylum ,COMMA which was demolished in <NUM> when columbia moved in .PERIOD <BREAK>
another one of my favorite dishes :COLON general tso's chicken -- which ,COMMA by the way ,COMMA in the us naval academy is called admiral tso's chicken .PERIOD <BREAK>
pat mitchell :COLON and this is your hospital .PERIOD this is the inside .PERIOD <BREAK>
you should just come across to see how well our children do .PERIOD <BREAK>
even when we've got off this little planet ,COMMA and have put some of our eggs in some other baskets .PERIOD <BREAK>
so you've got to focus .PERIOD <BREAK>
mustard exists ,COMMA just like tomato sauce ,COMMA on a horizontal plane .PERIOD <BREAK>
you could begin with the one that we began with a couple of days ago ,COMMA which was fear .PERIOD <BREAK>
and finally ,COMMA for the brits ,COMMA percy shaw -- this is a big british invention -- saw the cat's eyes at the side of the road ,COMMA when he was driving home one night and from that came the catseye .PERIOD <BREAK>
by expressing it as an if-then statement ,COMMA you can get the message across without appearing to boss another person around .PERIOD <BREAK>
if i'm cooking ,COMMA the door is shut ,COMMA the kids are out ,COMMA the phone's on the hook ,COMMA if she comes in i get annoyed .PERIOD <BREAK>
but what we started to think is that maybe there is something practical that we can do here as well .PERIOD <BREAK>
but one of the coolest things in this book are the interactive infographics .PERIOD <BREAK>
it was probably one of my better tirades ,COMMA i have some good ones ,COMMA but this was probably one of my better ones .PERIOD and i went into these people ;SEMICOLON how could they take bmw's money ,COMMA how could they have a holiday for three months and produce nothing ,COMMA nothing ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
it's in the eye of the beholder .PERIOD <BREAK>
each one of these genes has potential diagnostic test .PERIOD <BREAK>
they say ,COMMA i have to give one up ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
the list of things which we strictly have to be agnostic about doesn't stop at tooth fairies and teapots .PERIOD it's infinite .PERIOD <BREAK>
we're about to take a break in a moment .PERIOD <BREAK>
within a few weeks ,COMMA i was performing ,COMMA and in a few months ,COMMA i debuted at the kennedy center .PERIOD <BREAK>
we always argue a lot about the soundtrack ,COMMA but in this case it was really easy to choose the song .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's a delicate machine running on computer algorithms ,COMMA and it needs special care ,COMMA tlc ,COMMA to keep it up and running ,COMMA and it's going to break pretty easily .PERIOD <BREAK>
so how do we recover from that ,COMMA ladies and gentlemen ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
it is definitely the first stringed instrument ever in the world ,COMMA and still played in the southern mountains .PERIOD <BREAK>
the governments of the world are going to have to decide that coals need to be made expensive ,COMMA and these will go ahead .PERIOD <BREAK>
an entrepreneur doesn't expect a regular paycheck .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is a very important thing to know about people .PERIOD <BREAK>
and if there were ,COMMA i would have remembered that one .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so in japan ,COMMA i began to experiment with people .PERIOD <BREAK>
chris asked me to tell again how we found the structure of dna .PERIOD <BREAK>
on the one hand ,COMMA people say ,COMMA the time for change is now .PERIOD <BREAK>
on november <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> ,COMMA pascal had a profound religious experience .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's not about compliance .PERIOD it's about setting ,COMMA getting the job done ,COMMA by bending or breaking the rules -- just look at your indian people around here ,COMMA you'll see them smile ;SEMICOLON they know what it is .PERIOD <BREAK>
we are very interested in delivering health care in the developing world ,COMMA and one of the things that we wish to do in this particular business is to find a way of doing medical diagnosis at as close to zero cost as we can manage .PERIOD <BREAK>
but if you take the same carbon atoms and interconnect them a different way ,COMMA you get diamond ,COMMA which is clear and hard .PERIOD <BREAK>
somebody from india would know ,COMMA of course .PERIOD <BREAK>
and basically what i was saying is very simple .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the talk you heard about ethanol earlier today ,COMMA to me ,COMMA is the final triumph of corn over good sense .PERIOD <BREAK>
culture's a very important tool to bring people together .PERIOD <BREAK>
the goal is not to turn kids into your kind of adult ,COMMA but rather better adults than you have been ,COMMA which may be a little challenging considering your guys' credentials .PERIOD <BREAK>
when he aimed ,COMMA he never missed .PERIOD <BREAK>
or even in the swiss office of google ,COMMA which perhaps has the most wacky ideas of all .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i watched them being locked up in prison and tear gassed .PERIOD <BREAK>
don’t know what they do with that ,COMMA but they have one .PERIOD <BREAK>
well ,COMMA what you do is ,COMMA if you take any one of you here ,COMMA and put you in front of a screen ,COMMA and measure your galvanic skin response ,COMMA and show pictures on the screen ,COMMA i can measure how you sweat when you see an object ,COMMA like a table or an umbrella .PERIOD of course ,COMMA you don't sweat .PERIOD <BREAK>
that one is a naked biped .PERIOD why ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
so you can imagine ,COMMA if you are in the middle of a tense cabinet meeting -- and he had hundreds of these stories -- you would have to relax .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is samuel .PERIOD he's a farmer .PERIOD <BREAK>
except ,COMMA if you had taken physical anthropology as recently as <NUM> or <NUM> years ago ,COMMA in many cases you would have learned basically that same classification of humanity .PERIOD <BREAK>
then ,COMMA instead of looking like a plaster mannequin ,COMMA it actually looks like it's made out of living human flesh .PERIOD <BREAK>
within <NUM> years of the first gallbladder surgeries being done laparoscopically ,COMMA a majority of gallbladder surgeries were being done laparoscopically -- truly a pretty big revolution .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it's kind of constrained by that circle .PERIOD <BREAK>
we then go on to the first thing that was very surprising .PERIOD <BREAK>
thank you once again .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is not the end ,COMMA this is the beginning of the end .PERIOD <BREAK>
sounds ridiculous ,COMMA right .PERIOD <BREAK>
so luke ,COMMA you go to your communications professors -- you're majoring in communications -- and you ask them for permission to come to ted ,COMMA which might have a little bit to do with communications ,COMMA and what was their reaction ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
their exports went down a lot in the early <NUM> s -- and actually that decline lines up really ,COMMA really closely with this decline in new hiv infections .PERIOD <BREAK>
looking at fossils dating back several millions of years -- it all points to evidence that life for the human species as we know it began right here .PERIOD <BREAK>
and another idea that i had as well ,COMMA that was brought forward by an ecologist -- he basically did a calculation where he took one liter of gas and said ,COMMA well ,COMMA how much carbon it would take ,COMMA and how much organic material ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
but if you take a look at the two other biggest markets in the world ,COMMA it turns out that the protection that's offered is really ineffectual .PERIOD <BREAK>
in case you're wondering ,COMMA this is our strength test .PERIOD <BREAK>
in particular ,COMMA i'm interested in the relationship to the future financial self .PERIOD <BREAK>
now this museum is just as important to us as the west .PERIOD <BREAK>
and there's even supernormal stimuli for cuteness .PERIOD here’s a pretty good example .PERIOD <BREAK>
but in fact ,COMMA with global warming and rising temperatures ,COMMA all of a sudden you have vast wheat fields and agribusiness ,COMMA and grain being produced in siberia .PERIOD <BREAK>
however ,COMMA if a video is there that everything was explained to you ,COMMA and you have it all in the video file ,COMMA it'll be much less likely that some hotshot lawyer will take this case on contingency ,COMMA because it won't be nearly as good a case .PERIOD <BREAK>
and as soon as it's silent ,COMMA they sort of creep out .PERIOD <BREAK>
and with his only diploma ,COMMA his primary education certificate ,COMMA he found himself working at a dyer - dry cleaner .PERIOD <BREAK>
and a signal would give us a glimpse of their past ,COMMA not their present .PERIOD <BREAK>
she wanted to dance .PERIOD <BREAK>
and let's do it soon .PERIOD thank you .PERIOD <BREAK>
yet ,COMMA there is hope .PERIOD <BREAK>
they're difficult integrals .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i thought ,COMMA well ,COMMA hey !EXCLAMATIONMARK <BREAK>
i think that there is a lot of suspense in this painting .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so what does that look like ?QUESTIONMARK typical .PERIOD <BREAK>
so now we have a complete living lamprey eel brain .PERIOD <BREAK>
yes ,COMMA it's happening here .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i went up to apologize to him ,COMMA and he said ,COMMA stanley ,COMMA i thought you did great .PERIOD <BREAK>
and in the time since galileo pointed that rudimentary telescope at the celestial bodies ,COMMA the known universe has come to us through light ,COMMA across vast eras in cosmic history .PERIOD <BREAK>
we wake up in the morning and we feel we make decisions .PERIOD <BREAK>
well ,COMMA the conventional approach to post-conflict situations has rested on ,COMMA on kind of ,COMMA three principles .PERIOD <BREAK>
and we do not ask this question .PERIOD <BREAK>
experimented with my body ,COMMA experimented with jewelry ,COMMA experimented with all sorts of things .PERIOD <BREAK>
others work through the instrument of money .PERIOD <BREAK>
her answer was quite the contrary .PERIOD <BREAK>
well ,COMMA if you go back to those psychologists and philosophers ,COMMA a lot of them have said that babies and young children were barely conscious if they were conscious at all .PERIOD <BREAK>
we have to remix it .PERIOD he's got a great voice .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it was at indiana i got the impression that ,COMMA you know ,COMMA the gene was likely to be dna .PERIOD <BREAK>
and you can see he's been to a few places around the united states .PERIOD <BREAK>
but even though i just started this presentation ,COMMA this is not the first thing that i tried to do and i was getting sort of desperate .PERIOD <BREAK>
the whole country went mad .PERIOD <BREAK>
i know john gage and sun microsystems are already on board for this ,COMMA but there's lots of you we'd like to talk to .PERIOD <BREAK>
okay ,COMMA there's not a person in this room -- i don't care how techie you are -- there's not a person in this room that doesn't give their laptop or cell phone to a kid to help them debug it .PERIOD ok ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
so let me go through those three things .PERIOD <BREAK>
wow ,COMMA they don’t do that in graduate schools ,COMMA i don’t think .PERIOD <BREAK>
in hospitals ,COMMA they are security issues .PERIOD <BREAK>
gateway could be a smartphone or it could be a dedicated gateway ,COMMA as today many of these things are dedicated gateways ,COMMA because they are not so well integrated .PERIOD <BREAK>
and these are being augmented even by our devices again today .PERIOD <BREAK>
we eat insects -- they're so distantly related from us that this doesn't happen .PERIOD <BREAK>
i know you're going to say to me ,COMMA t doesn't exist in music .PERIOD <BREAK>
all right ,COMMA so ,COMMA i've got a metronome ,COMMA and it's the world's smallest metronome ,COMMA the -- well ,COMMA i shouldn't advertise .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the way we do this is we basically place this through the soft tissue ,COMMA and kind of punch it into the hard bone ,COMMA into the tuchus -- that's a technical term -- and aspirate about <NUM> mls of bone marrow out ,COMMA each time ,COMMA with a syringe .PERIOD <BREAK>
here's arum ,COMMA arum maculatum ,COMMA lords and ladies ,COMMA or cuckoo-pint in this country .PERIOD <BREAK>
so this is the favorite thing that i like about this whole project .PERIOD <BREAK>
look at the pentagon ,COMMA for instance ,COMMA pull this out -- it becomes a boat shape trapezium .PERIOD <BREAK>
please stop !EXCLAMATIONMARK <BREAK>
you've got to institutionalize a system where you actually invite the kosovars to come and tell you what they think .PERIOD <BREAK>
i'd like to speak about technology trends ,COMMA which is something that many of you follow -- but we also follow ,COMMA for related reasons .PERIOD <BREAK>
in spite of all this splendor ,COMMA the beginning was extremely frustrating .PERIOD <BREAK>
they are basically the transport system on a quarry run by a slaveholder .PERIOD <BREAK>
i said ,COMMA well ,COMMA it's so persuasive ,COMMA because the purpose of that sign is to get you into the garage ,COMMA and since most people are so suspicious of garages ,COMMA and know that they're going to be ripped off ,COMMA they use the word 'reliable .PERIOD ' but everybody says they're reliable .PERIOD <BREAK>
my partner ,COMMA m ,COMMA who's a tech guru ,COMMA hacked wordpress .PERIOD <BREAK>
they're not really bright .PERIOD they don't have to be .PERIOD <BREAK>
and lost interest with him ,COMMA and went back to what she does best .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is a very quick overview of all the studies that i looked at .PERIOD <BREAK>
we can think about how we're going to test this intuition in our private life ,COMMA in our business life ,COMMA and most particularly when it goes to policy ,COMMA when we think about things like no child left behind ,COMMA when you create new stock markets ,COMMA when you create other policies -- taxation ,COMMA health care and so on .PERIOD <BREAK>
why is this ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
so that's the other gene we're looking for .PERIOD <BREAK>
you also see there a bighorn sheep .PERIOD <BREAK>
lay their eggs ,COMMA next generation ,COMMA they come up ,COMMA automatically carried to where the rain is falling .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's mozart as i ,COMMA riccardo muti ,COMMA understand it .PERIOD <BREAK>
torture ,COMMA wars -- oh ,COMMA my god ,COMMA you can't believe .PERIOD <BREAK>
i only stopped because i thought if i got caught ,COMMA what would happen to my mother .PERIOD <BREAK>
some are weather-related ,COMMA human-rights related ,COMMA epidemics .PERIOD <BREAK>
the goal is not to do business with everybody who needs what you have .PERIOD <BREAK>
and we know that levels of greenhouse gases are rising too .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i forgot there's obviously successful indians in dubai as well .PERIOD <BREAK>
and this guy's on display downstairs ,COMMA so take a look if you get a chance .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA here's what happens very soon after the onset of sight .PERIOD <BREAK>
this view of the world is a consequence of having studied degraded reefs .PERIOD <BREAK>
the patient's not delusional .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's one of the great cultural tragedies that we remember ,COMMA even today .PERIOD <BREAK>
that's what's so special about stories ,COMMA they're not a widget ,COMMA they aren't exact .PERIOD <BREAK>
but given my befuddled state of mind ,COMMA i ended up in the self-help section very quickly .PERIOD <BREAK>
let's go and try and talk to the headmistress .PERIOD <BREAK>
turn it on ;SEMICOLON turn it off .PERIOD <BREAK>
they don't produce different musical notes .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is the instructor that alicia and i chose for the male lead .PERIOD <BREAK>
you've got to think ,COMMA and i'm going to ask you some questions .PERIOD <BREAK>
but what you've just done is ,COMMA in many respects ,COMMA mathematically impossible .PERIOD <BREAK>
now ,COMMA what i took away from the exhibit was that maybe with the exception of the mandala most of the pieces in there were actually about the visualization of happiness and not about happiness .PERIOD <BREAK>
because many scholars who study the history of islamic thought -- muslim scholars or westerners -- think that actually the practice of dividing men and women physically came as a later development in islam ,COMMA as muslims adopted some preexisting cultures and traditions of the middle east .PERIOD <BREAK>
that's it .PERIOD thank you .PERIOD <BREAK>
<NUM> percent of the global population now lives in cities .PERIOD <BREAK>
and if you go too far on that ,COMMA that's just simply labeled as madness .PERIOD <BREAK>
but it only has to get close ,COMMA about a billion miles away ,COMMA one of these things .PERIOD <BREAK>
as frightening as the prospect was ,COMMA he was going into the next office .PERIOD <BREAK>
some further along than others .PERIOD <BREAK>
the magnetic works are a combination of gravity and magnetism ,COMMA so it's a kind of mixture of these ambient forces that influence everything .PERIOD <BREAK>
i was a little nervous because maybe the data wouldn't be right ,COMMA but i've done this now for <NUM> years ,COMMA and it has stayed on this exponential progression .PERIOD <BREAK>
and this is about the most exciting thing in my life right now ,COMMA which is perhaps a sad commentary on my life .PERIOD <BREAK>
so anyway ,COMMA i left .PERIOD <BREAK>
but in the quarter-century since then ,COMMA we've seen all of the fundamental supporting technologies go berserk .PERIOD <BREAK>
they don't sit in seminars on saturday morning .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's real slavery in exactly the same way that slavery would be recognized throughout all of human history .PERIOD <BREAK>
suffice to say it's like -- it's not the prettiest picture of sustainable farming .PERIOD <BREAK>
but in the last few decades that has totally changed .PERIOD <BREAK>
you can see here a little bit of heart muscle beating in a dish .PERIOD <BREAK>
how did this happen ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
dan ,COMMA thank you .PERIOD members of the audience ,COMMA that was a fantastic session .PERIOD thank you .PERIOD <BREAK>
we were on the stage and then -- by the way ,COMMA spectacular .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA it's needs we have .PERIOD i believe there are six human needs .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA our first year of marriage we went to <NUM> percent ,COMMA second year we went to <NUM> percent ,COMMA and the third year we went to <NUM> percent ,COMMA and on and on and on .PERIOD why did i do that ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
so ,COMMA it depends on how much virus there is in your blood and in your body fluids .PERIOD <BREAK>
the idea was -- and it was a brilliant idea -- was to have <NUM> posters distributed throughout the city's subway system so every time you got on the subway you'd be passing a different poster ,COMMA all of which had a different idea of what art is .PERIOD <BREAK>
still ,COMMA in my opinion ,COMMA we have two choices .PERIOD <BREAK>
power is chaotically distributed .PERIOD <BREAK>
and that kind of civic value is not just a side effect of opening up to human motivation .PERIOD <BREAK>
as you see here ,COMMA we had to develop a special rig to bring the scanner up close and personal .PERIOD <BREAK>
so to test this crazy idea ,COMMA we developed a small dune buggy prototype vehicle to test the feasibility .PERIOD <BREAK>
and when it hits the mid-brain ,COMMA that's when the headache begins .PERIOD <BREAK>
we're all i love lucy on a great assembly line of information ,COMMA and we can't keep up .PERIOD <BREAK>
some women have those heart attacks ,COMMA but a whole bunch of women have this kind of heart attack ,COMMA where it erodes ,COMMA doesn't completely fill with clot ,COMMA symptoms are subtle ,COMMA ekg findings are different -- female-pattern .PERIOD <BREAK>
as when we say we gather our ideas ,COMMA to put them into words ,COMMA and if our words aren't empty or hollow ,COMMA we might get these ideas across to a listener ,COMMA who can unpack our words to extract their content .PERIOD <BREAK>
remember that i mentioned before the children who lose their fingertips .PERIOD <BREAK>
and certainly ,COMMA no ,COMMA it doesn't look a thing like my office .PERIOD <BREAK>
and here's just a series of experiments where i ask the question of -- does a poster have to be square ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
so ,COMMA all the ideas about how to transform through design -- old quarries and open universities and botanic garden -- all of it's related to how we teach the children .PERIOD <BREAK>
and you can do more than just insects .PERIOD <BREAK>
thank you very much .PERIOD <BREAK>
at the end of the one i'm going to show ,COMMA it's only about a minute and a couple of seconds long ,COMMA chuck does something that to this day i'm jealous of ,COMMA i can't do it .PERIOD <BREAK>
those of you who changed your mind in favor of for put your hands up .PERIOD <BREAK>
and what do we teach in these schools ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and then time here ,COMMA from <NUM> i start the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
here's what happens :COLON we're all busy .PERIOD everyone's busy .PERIOD a woman's busy .PERIOD <BREAK>
but over the ' <NUM> s and ' <NUM> s ,COMMA the south korea government decided they wanted to rapidly industrialize ,COMMA and so what they did was ,COMMA they started to push women into the workforce .PERIOD <BREAK>
so each time i draw my circle of chalk on the pavement and enter as the improvising comic silent character i created <NUM> years ago ,COMMA i am as happy as when i am in the clouds .PERIOD <BREAK>
here's the forward version of the very famous song .PERIOD <BREAK>
and we drove for eight hours along this moonscape-like landscape with very little color ,COMMA lots of heat ,COMMA very little discussion ,COMMA because we were exhausted .PERIOD <BREAK>
and that’s really what discovery and imagination is all about .PERIOD <BREAK>
well ,COMMA dr .PERIOD king wasn't the only man in america who was a great orator .PERIOD <BREAK>
that ,COMMA to me ,COMMA is the big question that we face as a people right now :COLON how do we change ?QUESTIONMARK how do we change as a culture ,COMMA and how do we each individually take responsibility for the one piece of the solution that we are in charge of ,COMMA and that is our own behavior ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and you are still able to transmit data -- that's possible .PERIOD <BREAK>
because we think that because we are kind of tired of what we do ,COMMA a little bit tired ,COMMA we do suffer .PERIOD <BREAK>
because this isn't just the hypothetical retail value of some pirated movies that we're talking about ,COMMA but this is actual economic losses .PERIOD <BREAK>
we started selectively breeding animals many ,COMMA many thousands of years ago .PERIOD <BREAK>
and this is when great-grandma was born ,COMMA <NUM> .PERIOD <BREAK>
the old shyness was a fear of rejection .PERIOD <BREAK>
in the second group's scenario ,COMMA the walls are alive and actually give dilbert a group hug .PERIOD <BREAK>
<NUM> american citizens committed suicide or were murdered by family and friends in guyana jungle in <NUM> ,COMMA because they were blindly obedient to this guy ,COMMA their pastor -- not their priest -- their pastor ,COMMA reverend jim jones .PERIOD <BREAK>

ugh .PERIOD mini-me .PERIOD <BREAK>
there are many diseases which effect movement .PERIOD <BREAK>
and what that means :COLON simple and understandable might not be actually simple or understandable ,COMMA and things we think are complex might be made simple and understandable .PERIOD <BREAK>
we can also use satellite tags to track animals as they move through the oceans .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it's called seeds of the future are planted today .PERIOD <BREAK>
at this point ,COMMA she stops me ,COMMA and she says ,COMMA who are you ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
actually the country with more telephones is the soviet union ,COMMA and the data referred to <NUM> .PERIOD <BREAK>
we very strongly believe that the theatrics of a concert hall is as much in the space of intermission and the space of arrival as it is when the concert starts .PERIOD <BREAK>
to conclude ,COMMA there are also other applications at the horizon .PERIOD <BREAK>
economic growth to me ,COMMA as a public-health professor ,COMMA is the most important thing for development because it explains <NUM> percent of survival .PERIOD <BREAK>
what do you eat ?QUESTIONMARK one of my favorite dishes on expedition :COLON butter and bacon .PERIOD it's about a million calories .PERIOD <BREAK>
these trains that take you out to a concourse and on to a destination .PERIOD <BREAK>
there's nothing holding us back ,COMMA except our own mentality about play .PERIOD <BREAK>
and <NUM> or so tries later the monkey is performing it flawlessly -- never fails .PERIOD <BREAK>
then this is a fairly talkative ,COMMA verbose kind of chair .PERIOD <BREAK>
you know ,COMMA in primates ,COMMA there is this phenomenon called sexual dimorphism ,COMMA which simply means males are larger than females and males have larger teeth than the females .PERIOD <BREAK>
their populations are more diverse than typical suburbia ,COMMA but they're less diverse than cities .PERIOD <BREAK>
and as we treated these cells with this molecule ,COMMA we observed something really striking .PERIOD <BREAK>
you can kind of peer into other people's lives ,COMMA and i also feel like i get a lot of inspiration from the average user .PERIOD <BREAK>
basic windows functions ,COMMA browsing ,COMMA painting ,COMMA chatting and email ,COMMA games and educational material ,COMMA music downloads ,COMMA playing video .PERIOD <BREAK>
these memory cells immediately deploy the exact weapons needed .PERIOD <BREAK>
so what we see is that this neuron knows whenever the rat has gone into one particular place in its environment .PERIOD <BREAK>
i mean ,COMMA that's interesting .PERIOD one could extend this sort of statistical analysis to cover all mr .PERIOD haring's various works ,COMMA in order to establish in which period the artist favored pale green circles or pink squares .PERIOD <BREAK>
because when you put it on ,COMMA you immediately get everything you need to have a fun and productive and useful meeting .PERIOD <BREAK>
perhaps ,COMMA i dare say ,COMMA even on other planets .PERIOD <BREAK>
different quantum states of an atom ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
this kind of alphabet soup is a new way to mark proteins -- not only by color but literally by alphabet letters .PERIOD <BREAK>
and we saw over and over the way that spoken word poetry cracks open locks .PERIOD <BREAK>
but if you have a sexual species ,COMMA then it's possible for an individual to inherit both mutations from different lineages .PERIOD <BREAK>
how many of you think -- a few -- how many of you there are more females in the world ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>

they're all weighted equally .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's not just ,COMMA though ,COMMA these days ,COMMA adults who overwork ,COMMA though ,COMMA is it ?QUESTIONMARK it's children ,COMMA too .PERIOD <BREAK>
so first i started with the mind .PERIOD <BREAK>
look into those eyes .PERIOD i'm not able to focus those eyes .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's plaster and just zinc .PERIOD <BREAK>
and yet finally ,COMMA we have the tools ,COMMA which will allow us to actually explore that world and understand them .PERIOD <BREAK>
this real sense of alienation from the part of us that made a decision we regret .PERIOD <BREAK>
and then if you look at the amount of time that they spend on these sites ,COMMA they truly dominate the social media space ,COMMA which is a space that's having a huge impact on old media .PERIOD <BREAK>
we didn't really understand that .PERIOD <BREAK>
ladies and gentlemen ,COMMA can any one of you tell me a neighbor ,COMMA a friend ,COMMA a relative that you know ,COMMA who became rich by receiving charity ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
they either pop the bacterial membrane ,COMMA they make the bacterium so it can't replicate its dna .PERIOD <BREAK>
and then subsequently ,COMMA never mind the bollocks ,COMMA here's the sex pistols ,COMMA the word bollocks ,COMMA the police decided was a rude word and so we were arrested for using the word bollocks on the sex pistols' album .PERIOD <BREAK>
and there are some charity workers who call this compassion fatigue .PERIOD <BREAK>
so then there's also my favorite example of suspended animation .PERIOD <BREAK>
kindergarten begins in kindergarten .PERIOD <BREAK>
just looked like the coast of california for me .PERIOD <BREAK>

there's a big array of the ways of dealing with this .PERIOD <BREAK>
we reckon that we are a bit over halfway to our goal :COLON zero impact ,COMMA zero footprint .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it also will affect normal circuits as well as the abnormal ones that you want to fix .PERIOD <BREAK>
i got the chinese line .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the last time the rich guy invited us ,COMMA he also invited a couple of philosophers .PERIOD <BREAK>
so the fact that not only did cancer not seem to originate in skeletal muscles ,COMMA but cancer didn't seem to go to skeletal muscle -- there seemed to be something here .PERIOD <BREAK>
they were tough football players doing what they love ,COMMA which was crushing skulls and separating shoulders on the football field .PERIOD <BREAK>

we can save the planet ,COMMA but we can't do it alone -- we need each other .PERIOD <BREAK>
my wife pointed out to me that it will work better if i put both on at the same time because otherwise the whole thing will tip over .PERIOD <BREAK>

we're either going to have an absolutely unmitigated catastrophe of this oil leak in the gulf ,COMMA or we will make the moment we need out of this ,COMMA as many people have noted today .PERIOD <BREAK>
the first reason is local open feedstocks .PERIOD <BREAK>
okay ,COMMA try this .PERIOD bring it back .PERIOD <BREAK>
so now i have to really figure out all kinds of stuff i don't know how to do .PERIOD <BREAK>
now before we go on ,COMMA i have a confession to make .PERIOD <BREAK>
every family had a cook ,COMMA usually a mom .PERIOD <BREAK>
and we had to take action .PERIOD now our kids found out about it .PERIOD <BREAK>
and finally ,COMMA i hope you agree with me to change that last toddler rule just a little bit to :COLON if it's broken ,COMMA it's my stuff .PERIOD <BREAK>
can we move that up a little bit ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
paradoxically ,COMMA when i let go of these objectives ,COMMA and worked from a place of compassion and purpose ,COMMA looking for excellence ,COMMA rather than the results of it ,COMMA everything arrived on its own ,COMMA including fulfillment .PERIOD <BREAK>

just please accept that this piece of you escapes with your smile ,COMMA and those of us who notice are happy to catch it in passing .PERIOD <BREAK>
he got his name from fighting stark naked .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is ,COMMA i think ,COMMA a very illustrative image of what i try to say -- that the beautiful dynamics of sun ,COMMA bringing these into the building ,COMMA creates a quality of our built environment that truly enhances our lives .PERIOD <BREAK>
we now live in a global village where we can mimic the ties that used to happen face to face ,COMMA but on a scale and in ways that have never been possible before .PERIOD <BREAK>

if he beat ,COMMA we will put [him] in jail ,COMMA and we will call the eldest people .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it's probably the most intense kind of territory of the work ,COMMA which is not occupied ,COMMA because architecture is always the most interesting in some mechanism when it's separated from function ,COMMA and this is an area that allows for that .PERIOD <BREAK>
so the blue dots are selected randomly .PERIOD <BREAK>
what this means -- you don't see a lot of it ,COMMA but you see the first stirrings of something really interesting going on ,COMMA because what it means is paying people adequately and fairly ,COMMA absolutely -- getting the issue of money off the table ,COMMA and then giving people lots of autonomy .PERIOD <BREAK>
you can order a kit .PERIOD you can test your own dna .PERIOD <BREAK>
we'll pick it up .PERIOD we'll make sure it's stored properly .PERIOD -- their yields have gone up two- ,COMMA three- ,COMMA fourfold and they figure it out ,COMMA because it's the first guaranteed opportunity they've had in their life .PERIOD <BREAK>

they say ,COMMA it's okay ,COMMA we'll email you .PERIOD <BREAK>
then ,COMMA of course ,COMMA i looked at my mom and my dad -- karolina and karl ,COMMA and grandmom and granddad ,COMMA josefine and josef .PERIOD <BREAK>
and those vistas will both create new science ,COMMA and fundamental change in the world as we see it ,COMMA in the next hundred years .PERIOD <BREAK>

so this weighs a little more than a tenth of a pound .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the idea behind this is to do the perfect job doing search ,COMMA you really have to be smart .PERIOD <BREAK>
next ,COMMA we need proper science ,COMMA proper evidence .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the second thing ,COMMA i think ,COMMA is that the world needs to have people in charge of that .PERIOD <BREAK>
one quarter of a million of them applied by hand as the final finish .PERIOD <BREAK>
now ,COMMA until <NUM> - <NUM> ,COMMA the bulk of all this money flew into the u .PERIOD s .PERIOD economy because the bulk of the money was denominated in u .PERIOD s .PERIOD dollars and the money laundering was taking place inside the united states .PERIOD <BREAK>
what you see over here ,COMMA this is what we want to do next .PERIOD <BREAK>
i actually find them a lot more emotional -- -- and personal ,COMMA and the neat thing about a slide projector is you can actually focus the work ,COMMA unlike powerpoint and some other programs .PERIOD <BREAK>

and they said ,COMMA these kids are misled .PERIOD <BREAK>
and over the last <NUM> years ,COMMA seva's programs in <NUM> countries have given back sight to more than two million blind people .PERIOD <BREAK>
what a moron .PERIOD <BREAK>
two great texts ,COMMA what about the politics ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
this typifies a lot of situations in life in which you will gain by waiting ,COMMA but you have to be patient .PERIOD <BREAK>
we have the androids that are inspired by man .PERIOD <BREAK>

you might think of that as the privatization of war .PERIOD <BREAK>
they tied the rebar right ,COMMA they poured the columns right ,COMMA and that building will be safe .PERIOD <BREAK>
we had to grow them in vermi manure ,COMMA which is sterile ,COMMA or hydroponics ,COMMA and take them outdoors every three to four months .PERIOD <BREAK>
and then in paintbrushes ,COMMA hairs are used because ,COMMA apparently ,COMMA they're very suitable for making paintbrushes because of their hard-wearing nature .PERIOD <BREAK>
they can be community leaders .PERIOD <BREAK>
there is a story about olof palme ,COMMA the swedish prime minister ,COMMA going to see ronald reagan in america in the <NUM> s .PERIOD <BREAK>
some of these organizations don't even have the united states as a member .PERIOD <BREAK>
a couple of years ago ,COMMA i was in new york ,COMMA and i was pitching a deal ,COMMA and i was in one of those fancy new york private equity offices you can picture .PERIOD <BREAK>
alright what about problems ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
so the main slogan here is that there’s nothing outside the universe ,COMMA which means that there’s no place to put an explanation for something outside .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is all real .PERIOD so why don't we go ahead and start those pictures .PERIOD <BREAK>
fifteen percent suffer migraines that wipe them out for days on end .PERIOD <BREAK>
so we look at the bone histology .PERIOD <BREAK>
to what extent do we self-construct ,COMMA do we self-invent ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
i'm really worried that ,COMMA especially kids today ,COMMA they're not going to be dealing with this down-time ,COMMA that they have an instantaneous button-clicking culture ,COMMA and that everything comes to them ,COMMA and that they become very excited about it and very addicted to it .PERIOD <BREAK>
it doesn't see any excess cost .PERIOD it doesn't spend any extra time .PERIOD <BREAK>
i notice this stuff because i walk a lot ,COMMA but here ,COMMA private industry is really kind of making a mess of the public sector .PERIOD <BREAK>
she wasn't unhappy about this .PERIOD she was resigned .PERIOD <BREAK>

jean-baptiste michel :COLON so how did we get to this conclusion ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
it's the other way around .PERIOD <BREAK>

many there were ,COMMA to covet her kiss .PERIOD <BREAK>
it may be good technology ,COMMA but i feel like there's not enough of a support structure .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's about <NUM> degrees outside .PERIOD <BREAK>

it's a commercial example .PERIOD <BREAK>
how are people supposed to have any kind of common understanding or know how to move together into the future ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
if you give the nets for free ,COMMA people are not going to value them .PERIOD <BREAK>

my country is dominated by drug economy and a mafia .PERIOD <BREAK>
so this was an unprogrammed area where people could pretty much do anything ,COMMA including eat ,COMMA yell ,COMMA play chess and so forth .PERIOD <BREAK>
unfortunately ,COMMA some very important images are deemed too graphic or disturbing for us to see them .PERIOD <BREAK>
you could literally ,COMMA i mean this ,COMMA pass this particular unit without knowing any physics ,COMMA just knowing how to decode a textbook .PERIOD that's a shame .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i did .PERIOD we started to redesign them ,COMMA one by one .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's constructed .PERIOD it's created in your brain .PERIOD <BREAK>
how do we tackle things like mobility ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
i photographed him at the scene of the crime at the snake river in idaho .PERIOD <BREAK>
and there's a beautiful reef ,COMMA very complex reef ,COMMA with lots of animals ,COMMA including a lot of octopus .PERIOD <BREAK>
i came to this because ,COMMA if you're going to have a reference that we know as self -- the me ,COMMA the i in our own processing -- we need to have something that is stable ,COMMA something that does not deviate much from day to day .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i needed to find something historically that would match that .PERIOD <BREAK>
it turns out that these long-lived mutants are more resistant to all these diseases .PERIOD <BREAK>
you ask her where she lives -- where does she live in exile ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
here's a wonderful fractal .PERIOD <BREAK>

and you can eat something new everyday .PERIOD <BREAK>
there is a particular way of knowing .PERIOD <BREAK>
and in the first session ,COMMA they all said ,COMMA this is not bribery ,COMMA what we are doing .PERIOD this is customary there .PERIOD <BREAK>
so i created this image of diana ,COMMA dodi and their imaginary mixed-race child and this image came out ,COMMA which caused a huge public outcry at the time .PERIOD <BREAK>
found the protein collagen .PERIOD <BREAK>
and these patterns of points that i've shown for you actually represent symmetries of this high-dimensional object that would be warping and moving and dancing over the space time that we experience .PERIOD <BREAK>
and he works this system .PERIOD <BREAK>
intelligence appears all over the place ,COMMA in all kinds of guises .PERIOD <BREAK>
so we started exploring this material called etfe .PERIOD <BREAK>

if you think of everything in your life that you own ,COMMA when you walk out that door ,COMMA what do you consider to take with you ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
anthony atala :COLON see ,COMMA at the end of the day ,COMMA the promise of regenerative medicine is a single promise .PERIOD <BREAK>

now one of the challenges in polio ,COMMA still ,COMMA is marketing ,COMMA but it might not be what you think .PERIOD <BREAK>
you might have a guess .PERIOD <BREAK>
you said spades ?QUESTIONMARK lg :COLON ah .PERIOD <BREAK>
that's how it seems to us .PERIOD <BREAK>
here we have the description of the order of nature .PERIOD <BREAK>
gray was a soldier in the american army in world war ii .PERIOD <BREAK>
nuclear energy comes for a simple reason .PERIOD <BREAK>
and that is the fact that space itself is expanding .PERIOD <BREAK>
they get a car ,COMMA and they go to work .PERIOD <BREAK>
but very quickly i recovered .PERIOD it was like that .PERIOD <BREAK>
we're able to now build buildings that generate all their own electricity ,COMMA that recycle much of their water ,COMMA that are much more comfortable than standard buildings ,COMMA use all-natural light ,COMMA etc .PERIOD and ,COMMA over time ,COMMA cost less .PERIOD <BREAK>
you see ,COMMA it wasn't working very well .PERIOD <BREAK>
i did a study of the top epidemiologists in the world in october .PERIOD <BREAK>
apartments ,COMMA etc .PERIOD <BREAK>
we can't just say ,COMMA well ,COMMA if they're young enough to benefit from these therapies ,COMMA then they'll live <NUM> years longer .PERIOD <BREAK>
well ,COMMA why aren't we ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
so ,COMMA i am indeed going to talk about the spaces men create for themselves ,COMMA but first i want to tell you why i'm here .PERIOD <BREAK>
we can't .PERIOD <BREAK>
online crime is the one thing that might take these things away from us .PERIOD <BREAK>
and for those of us who are control freaks and perfectionists -- and i know where of i speak -- this is really hard ,COMMA because we want to do everything ourselves and we want to do it right .PERIOD <BREAK>
it means ,COMMA i think ,COMMA that we're living in a time of unexpected possibilities .PERIOD <BREAK>
after the a-bomb ,COMMA specialists said it would take <NUM> years for the radiation-damaged soil of hiroshima city to ever grow anything again .PERIOD <BREAK>
well what percentage of those bombs do you think actually landed inside the <NUM> -acre perimeter of the plant ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and we do know that in domestic animals and others ,COMMA when they're play deprived ,COMMA they don't -- and rats also -- they don't develop a brain that is normal .PERIOD <BREAK>
so i'm going to show you a five-year-old who is getting a standard kind of puzzle that we call the false belief task .PERIOD <BREAK>
and what it means for all of us is that everybody in this room could live an extra five ,COMMA <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> years just because of this one thing .PERIOD <BREAK>
and as i lifted my leg out of bed ,COMMA she reached for my crutches and handed them to me .PERIOD <BREAK>
there's actually more mountains in the ocean than there are on land .PERIOD <BREAK>
the dining room looked like this .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's a distinction perhaps we might make between two nobel laureates ,COMMA richard feynman and john nash .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is a road where it's been shored up by computer boards in one of the biggest towns where they're recycling .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i was dying .PERIOD she was absolutely not giving me a thing .PERIOD <BREAK>
i'm always surprised the u .PERIOD s .PERIOD army sociologists are discussing of the impact for instance ,COMMA of soldiers in iraq having daily contact with their families .PERIOD <BREAK>
and that's the building ,COMMA and that's the model ,COMMA and on the right's a high-tech greenhouse and in the middle's the medical technology building .PERIOD <BREAK>
and in the case of the accident ,COMMA where she thought that it was sugar ,COMMA but it was really poison and so she caused a death ,COMMA people say that it was less okay ,COMMA she deserves more blame .PERIOD <BREAK>
so two of them implanted in the body would weigh less than a dime .PERIOD <BREAK>
and as i go here ,COMMA i just want to show you what we can bring into classrooms ,COMMA and indeed ,COMMA what we can bring into your pocket .PERIOD <BREAK>
and that will get you very far .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the ship sinks ,COMMA and the captain has lost everything ,COMMA but for a life jacket .PERIOD <BREAK>
this really shows you ,COMMA we have not seen good economic and health progress anywhere in the world without destroying the climate .PERIOD <BREAK>
and that's a quite clever guy ,COMMA huh ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
well ,COMMA there are teams of scientists at harvard and the university of utah that are bending their brains to try to figure out what the tarahumara have known forever .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i can control it by putting the lift on one side of the wing ,COMMA or on the other .PERIOD <BREAK>
and economics is very interested in scarcity .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i think we need to support all of the dreams of the kids out there doing these crazy things .PERIOD <BREAK>
again ,COMMA people from all over the country doing -- the watch is particularly incredible .PERIOD <BREAK>
that is outrageous .PERIOD <BREAK>
it was two persons saying ,COMMA let's do this ,COMMA and the company said ,COMMA yes .PERIOD <BREAK>
an intelligent receptacle prevents injuries because the power is always off ,COMMA until an intelligent plug is detected .PERIOD simple .PERIOD <BREAK>
and we need to be able to build this thing using simple manufacturing techniques and factories that don't cost us a fortune .PERIOD <BREAK>
now how would you -- now think about that for a moment .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is her <NUM> years later .PERIOD <BREAK>
that's not just how is the colony organized ,COMMA but how does it change what it's doing ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and he would say ,COMMA listen ,COMMA i know i gave you that huge pill ,COMMA that complicated ,COMMA hard-to-swallow pill before ,COMMA but now i've got one that's so potent ,COMMA that is really tiny and small and almost invisible .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i hope you'll come with me on my basic premise that words matter ,COMMA that they shape the way we understand ourselves ,COMMA the way we interpret the world and the way we treat others .PERIOD <BREAK>
that wave is much larger ,COMMA much more powerful ,COMMA and that's of course the wave of technology .PERIOD <BREAK>
edith widder :COLON so i recorded that with an intensified video camera that has about the sensitivity of the fully dark-adapted human eye .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i'll give you some examples with those three questions .PERIOD <BREAK>
that’s all there is to it .PERIOD <BREAK>
it startled ,COMMA then bored ,COMMA then repelled me .PERIOD <BREAK>
if you've been punched on the nose ,COMMA then the science of medicine does not consist of teaching you how to avoid punches .PERIOD <BREAK>
for me ,COMMA they share a fundamental problem :COLON they're too slow .PERIOD <BREAK>
consumption ,COMMA in that sense ,COMMA is an expression of their productive potential .PERIOD <BREAK>
and ,COMMA in this case ,COMMA it was a massive undertaking to explore a planet ,COMMA and to come to understand a planetary system that ,COMMA for all of human history ,COMMA had been unreachable ,COMMA and now humans had actually touched it .PERIOD <BREAK>
so i ran this experiment recently for the korean broadcasting system .PERIOD <BREAK>
but in the third great arena of life ,COMMA love ,COMMA len is an abysmal failure .PERIOD <BREAK>
and that would be what explains all these elementary particles that we see .PERIOD <BREAK>
the wind may turn ,COMMA but the animal will turn always its nose into the wind .PERIOD <BREAK>
there are lots and lots of ways of measuring things -- weighing them and measuring their length -- but the metric system is winning .PERIOD <BREAK>
the art of storytelling has remained unchanged .PERIOD <BREAK>
a hundred years ago ,COMMA it's certainly true that to drive a car you kind of needed to know a lot about the mechanics of the car and how the ignition timing worked and all sorts of things .PERIOD <BREAK>
and they fly into the erupting volcano .PERIOD <BREAK>
he can't feel even that he's hungry or tired .PERIOD <BREAK>
almost always ,COMMA when i'm on tv ,COMMA the producers who call me ,COMMA who negotiate what we're going to say ,COMMA is a woman .PERIOD <BREAK>
because then renewables such as wind and solar come out from the wings ,COMMA here to center stage .PERIOD <BREAK>
so the machine would get started ,COMMA it would travel some distance ,COMMA reacting along the way ,COMMA hit play on an ipod or a tape deck or something that would start playback .PERIOD <BREAK>
we developed some other technology called spider optics ,COMMA and craig ventner asked me to make an announcement here this morning :COLON we’re going to be building a beautiful ,COMMA little ,COMMA small version of this -- unmanned ,COMMA super deep -- for his boat to go and get back some deep sea dna stuff .PERIOD <BREAK>
they survived as long as they did at a time when the social safety nets weren't there .PERIOD <BREAK>
you know ,COMMA <NUM> years before it was still ,COMMA ask not what you can do ,COMMA but with reagan ,COMMA it's ,COMMA that's where ,COMMA there's nancy and i ,COMMA that kind of language .PERIOD <BREAK>

i love mythology too much .PERIOD <BREAK>
all right ,COMMA okay .PERIOD <BREAK>
takes five minutes .PERIOD that's it ,COMMA it's not that hard .PERIOD <BREAK>
she explained that the father that she'd had would tell them he'd come and pick them up on sunday to go for a walk .PERIOD <BREAK>
i mean ,COMMA you'd think this is the result of some tabletop experiment ,COMMA but this is the result of worldwide chaotic behavior -- countries accusing each other of dumping products ,COMMA ipos ,COMMA bankruptcies ,COMMA marketing programs .PERIOD <BREAK>
and you wouldn't believe it ,COMMA but the one after that is going to be called the overwhelmingly large telescope .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the ones over there ,COMMA they were so-called western countries .PERIOD <BREAK>
and this is a person who is alive .PERIOD <BREAK>
ok ,COMMA so since you all don't understand what the five-ball pattern is ,COMMA i'm going to give you a little clue .PERIOD <BREAK>
like a wide-eyed kid ,COMMA i'd say ,COMMA why is that ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
the act of observation changes it .PERIOD <BREAK>
these deep sequencing tools are relatively new .PERIOD <BREAK>
fair enough .PERIOD <BREAK>
and as the student video showed ,COMMA we can impact and move .PERIOD <BREAK>
he was worried about right and wrong .PERIOD <BREAK>
the service which grew out of this ,COMMA dial <NUM> for ambulance ,COMMA with one ambulance in <NUM> ,COMMA now has a hundred-plus ambulances in three states ,COMMA and has transported over <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> patients and victims since inception .PERIOD <BREAK>

we feel awe ,COMMA we feel pity .PERIOD <BREAK>
these things are under attack around the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the choir conductor there knew that i sang and invited me to come and join the choir .PERIOD <BREAK>

people around the world are getting better medicine -- but mentally ,COMMA we're falling apart .PERIOD <BREAK>
you're looking at her open lung biopsy .PERIOD <BREAK>

the only question is ,COMMA how short can you get ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
so basically ,COMMA what this focuses on is saying ,COMMA we can do a lot more by investing in prevention .PERIOD <BREAK>
i mean ,COMMA adam smith ,COMMA already writing in the late <NUM> th century ,COMMA said ,COMMA the chinese market is larger and more developed and more sophisticated than anything in europe .PERIOD <BREAK>
then i remembered it could be a bunch of things .PERIOD <BREAK>
what's interesting is the spike on the back of the dracorex was growing very fast as well .PERIOD <BREAK>
and this is the reason :COLON in two countries that hadn't had this disease for more than probably a decade ,COMMA on opposite sides of the globe ,COMMA there was suddenly terrible polio outbreaks .PERIOD <BREAK>
we don't need a reason .PERIOD <BREAK>
so here's some examples .PERIOD <BREAK>
consider this :COLON like the prophets ,COMMA all the superheroes are missing parents .PERIOD <BREAK>
the other thing is that we’ve got much lower costs .PERIOD <BREAK>
well ,COMMA indeed .PERIOD but what do you do when the two come into conflict and you're forced to make a decision that either is in britain's interest ,COMMA or the interest of britons ,COMMA or citizens elsewhere in the world ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and we really ,COMMA we really loved this machine .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA imagine a great white shark and a giant squid in the same bathroom .PERIOD <BREAK>
we have a common past ,COMMA and we have a common future .PERIOD <BREAK>
it is vital that we do so .PERIOD <BREAK>
i myself have a husband and a father and two sons whom i dearly love .PERIOD <BREAK>

maybe you're scratching yourself ,COMMA or picking your nose ,COMMA i don't know ,COMMA but you're not doing anything right now ,COMMA but you're being intelligent ;SEMICOLON you're understanding what i'm saying .PERIOD <BREAK>

regina ,COMMA that was jaw-dropping ,COMMA as they say .PERIOD <BREAK>
that <NUM> th year is called the jubilee year ,COMMA and it's the origin of that term .PERIOD <BREAK>

the universe is a contradiction .PERIOD <BREAK>

the department stores are multistory ;SEMICOLON they're better built .PERIOD <BREAK>

but like any basic research ,COMMA when you're really forced to do things that are way beyond existing technology ,COMMA you can get there with micro-technology ,COMMA nanotechnology .PERIOD <BREAK>
so we recently presented the master plan ,COMMA and it has gotten approved .PERIOD <BREAK>
notice ,COMMA again ,COMMA how they decorate their office .PERIOD <BREAK>
and when i was seven years old ,COMMA all of a sudden ,COMMA a search party arrived at my home .PERIOD <BREAK>
so the data goes in that direction ,COMMA not there anymore .PERIOD <BREAK>
and now it's got number power .PERIOD <BREAK>
we can think ,COMMA really ,COMMA that each one is sort of beyond the imagination of the inventor of the previous one ,COMMA if you like .PERIOD <BREAK>

the rna people would talk about the rna world .PERIOD <BREAK>

this attachment to our own rightness keeps us from preventing mistakes when we absolutely need to and causes us to treat each other terribly .PERIOD <BREAK>
and you can notice they have created a kind of false catchment .PERIOD <BREAK>
now governor perry of my newly-adopted state of texas was pushing this same line this past summer at the beginning of his oops-fated campaign for the republican presidential nomination ,COMMA proclaiming over and over that the science wasn't complete at the same time that <NUM> out of <NUM> counties in the state of texas were on fire .PERIOD <BREAK>

this is not some sort of cultural thing for the time of year .PERIOD <BREAK>

it shows us a general mistrust of government or government-backed institutions ,COMMA which lacked transparency in the past .PERIOD <BREAK>
all this leads to the development of self-esteem and confidence .PERIOD <BREAK>

you're seeing for the first time ,COMMA a brand new drywall production line ,COMMA not made using gypsum at all .PERIOD <BREAK>
what is so difficult and challenging is that we are also the objects of these changes .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i was thinking this morning of the good life ,COMMA and before i show you the rest of my presentation ,COMMA i'm going to violate ted rules here ,COMMA and i'm going to read you something from my book as quickly as i can .PERIOD <BREAK>
so beyond that ,COMMA in closing ,COMMA i'd just like to say that we're in this era of communications and device proliferation ,COMMA and it's really tremendous and exciting and sexy ,COMMA but i think what's really important is thinking about how we can simultaneously maintain a sense of wonder and a sense of criticality about the tools that we use and the ways in which we relate to the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i must say ,COMMA i thought of quite a few objects that i might try to swallow today and finally gave up on ,COMMA but he just did it and that was a wonderful thing .PERIOD <BREAK>
but we're not using it .PERIOD it's just sitting there .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA substantially larger than we even thought we would go initially .PERIOD <BREAK>
well ,COMMA there were two satellites which were particularly interesting .PERIOD <BREAK>
please come for the show .PERIOD <BREAK>
night shots are beautiful ,COMMA piercing the big dipper and the milky way .PERIOD <BREAK>
and what i wanted to work on is important stuff .PERIOD <BREAK>
when i turn the crank and i apply pressure ,COMMA it makes a sound like a barking dog .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so ,COMMA sometime ago ,COMMA i got this idea for a camera system .PERIOD <BREAK>
and this leads to oddities .PERIOD <BREAK>
i mean ,COMMA there are so many possibilities for why tumors don't go to skeletal muscle .PERIOD <BREAK>
think of it as a kind of secular church .PERIOD <BREAK>
a magician promises to deceive you -- and he does .PERIOD <BREAK>
where would we expect me ,COMMA robin chase ,COMMA to be thinking is imagine if we put a mesh-network device in every single car across america .PERIOD <BREAK>
it takes really a lot of time and it's expensive to train the operator to operate this complex arm .PERIOD <BREAK>

i was just staggered by it .PERIOD <BREAK>
and sometimes you can see them at vacation places like jackson hole or aspen .PERIOD <BREAK>
and what's more ,COMMA this guy doesn't need a wire connected all the way back to a power station burning fossil fuels .PERIOD <BREAK>
the personal debt-to-income ratio basically went from <NUM> percent to <NUM> percent in the span of about <NUM> years .PERIOD <BREAK>
the animals are simply gone .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is well beyond organic agriculture ,COMMA which is still a cartesian system ,COMMA more or less .PERIOD <BREAK>
i believe that we can overcome the threats to our consciousness ,COMMA that the human show can stay on the air for millennia to come .PERIOD <BREAK>
raise your hand if you had a serious fall in your household ,COMMA or any of your loved ones ,COMMA your parents or so forth .PERIOD right ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>

that's a great question .PERIOD <BREAK>
the breakfast that we eat as we sit down to check our email in the morning is still transported at great distances ,COMMA usually at the expense of the local ,COMMA more resilient food systems that would have supplied that in the past ,COMMA which we've so effectively devalued and dismantled .PERIOD <BREAK>
there will be stronger storms and greater flooding .PERIOD <BREAK>

now ,COMMA when we do studies -- we have ,COMMA with other colleagues around the world ,COMMA done over <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> interviews of people -- from dominican monks ,COMMA to blind nuns ,COMMA to himalayan climbers ,COMMA to navajo shepherds -- who enjoy their work .PERIOD <BREAK>
whatever you're doing with your hands ,COMMA it's understanding that gesture .PERIOD <BREAK>

anywhere there's life ,COMMA you're going to have this distribution ,COMMA as opposed to that distribution .PERIOD <BREAK>

it's not obvious exactly what's going on .PERIOD <BREAK>
one gene is changed out of <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> ,COMMA and look at it .PERIOD <BREAK>
a second part of the brain is called the dorsal stream .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA we are now able to read genomes .PERIOD <BREAK>
well ,COMMA i would have said the perfect fulfillment of purpose .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i'll just say what i'm about to do .PERIOD what i'm about to do -- i hope you can recognize that there's a distorted sine wave ,COMMA almost a triangular wave upon this hewlett-packard oscilloscope .PERIOD <BREAK>
how many of you did it by rotating the one on the left in your mind's eye ,COMMA to see if it matched up with the one on the right ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
our cities ,COMMA i would put to you ,COMMA are stockpiles of these surplus capacities .PERIOD <BREAK>
another example is a strength date ,COMMA in which we get couples to identify their highest strengths on the strengths test ,COMMA and then to design an evening in which they both use their strengths ,COMMA and we find this is a strengthener of relationships .PERIOD <BREAK>
[the <NUM> ] thank you .PERIOD <BREAK>
they were either born into or they proactively surrounded themselves with the right people .PERIOD <BREAK>
the object itself just means nothing .PERIOD <BREAK>
and a lot of my experiences resemble mirrors in some way .PERIOD <BREAK>
here's what the economists there said :COLON we find that financial incentives can result in a negative impact on overall performance .PERIOD <BREAK>
but densification is not going to work everywhere .PERIOD <BREAK>
and to cut a long story short ,COMMA eight months later we did fill the chicago cultural center's <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> square foot gallery .PERIOD <BREAK>
i went looking for a farm where these ideas about looking at things from the species' point of view are actually implemented ,COMMA and i found it in a man .PERIOD the farmer's name is joel salatin .PERIOD <BREAK>
and last ,COMMA i'm going to show you the example ,COMMA the story of dusty the cat .PERIOD <BREAK>
now ,COMMA my second example is for a slightly younger crowd .PERIOD <BREAK>
and when i saw this man's work ,COMMA i realized how bad i was at design ,COMMA or whatever i called it back then ,COMMA and i suddenly had a kind of career goal ,COMMA kind of in hot pursuit .PERIOD <BREAK>
and openings seemed -- everyone loves opening bridges ,COMMA but it's quite a basic thing .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's become this intense industrialized zone .PERIOD <BREAK>
i'd like to talk a little bit this morning about what happens if we move from design to design thinking .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's so unpredictable and so fragile .PERIOD <BREAK>
i think philosophically ,COMMA that was one of the most important papers that we've ever done because it showed how dynamic life was .PERIOD <BREAK>
so those of you who are going on one of the post-conference tours ,COMMA you'll get to see what a real savannah is like .PERIOD <BREAK>
but is he happy ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and so that gives you an idea of how exquisitely sensitive this is .PERIOD <BREAK>
we need to start acting .PERIOD <BREAK>
he said ,COMMA it's billy graham ,COMMA the preacher .PERIOD <BREAK>
but in order to do this ,COMMA one of the things we really need to do ,COMMA is we need to remember we are people of the hydrocarbon .PERIOD <BREAK>
this little robot was somehow able to tap into something deeply social within us -- and with that ,COMMA the promise of an entirely new way we could interact with robots .PERIOD <BREAK>
we talk about this a lot ,COMMA and i thought about trying to give an example of this .PERIOD so ,COMMA just one example :COLON madame de gaulle ,COMMA the wife of the french president ,COMMA was famously asked once ,COMMA what do you most desire ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
i had started smuggling books across the iron curtain to democratic opposition groups in eastern europe ,COMMA like solidarity in poland ,COMMA when i was in my teens .PERIOD <BREAK>

so she belongs to our family tree ,COMMA but within that ,COMMA of course ,COMMA you do detailed analysis ,COMMA and we know now that she belongs to the lucy species ,COMMA known as australopithecus afarensis .PERIOD <BREAK>
so i'm going to give you an example ,COMMA a very simple example of how this works .PERIOD <BREAK>
the wrong framing is a product of thinking that africa is a place of despair .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i still worked as a tour leader ,COMMA traveled back and forth in china ,COMMA tibet and central asia .PERIOD <BREAK>
and if we can look at these things and learn from them and see how to turn them outwards ,COMMA then i really think we have something quite revolutionary on our hands .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i'm telling you ,COMMA it's not even close .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is an image from tuscany ,COMMA where we feel agriculture is still about beauty .PERIOD <BREAK>
i want to know how they impact me .PERIOD <BREAK>
so after putting together a grid of these cubes with tape -- -- michael hacked off the x-ray plate of a mammography machine that was about to be thrown out ,COMMA and we attached the new detector ,COMMA and we decided to call this machine molecular breast imaging ,COMMA or mbi .PERIOD <BREAK>
i've been playing ted for nearly a decade ,COMMA and i've very rarely played any new songs of my own .PERIOD <BREAK>
and this is the paradigm that we see throughout the universe .PERIOD <BREAK>
and slowly over time ,COMMA i started putting myself in a better mood .PERIOD <BREAK>
let's actually try that .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the question is ,COMMA who would go all the way to <NUM> volts ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
relationships -- how do you negotiate ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and then we turn the page of the magazine ,COMMA and we see this -- now this is the page the fda requires pharmaceutical companies to put into their ads ,COMMA or to follow their ads ,COMMA and to me ,COMMA this is one of the cynical exercises in medicine .PERIOD <BREAK>
hip replacement .PERIOD okay ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
it's all the pattern recognition .PERIOD <BREAK>
so what i did is i opened up a hotline -- a hotline where people could leave voicemails of their pain ,COMMA not necessarily related to that event .PERIOD <BREAK>
we can do it with existing political structures .PERIOD <BREAK>
i sent the message :COLON what is going about the progress of the war and what they are planning to do .PERIOD <BREAK>
that's in his autobiography .PERIOD <BREAK>
you can do lots of market research and do focus groups and figure out what people really want ,COMMA or you can just kind of go for it and make the book you want and hope other people like it .PERIOD <BREAK>
they said ,COMMA lewis ,COMMA you need to have a radical tactical shift if you want to do this swim .PERIOD <BREAK>
and ,COMMA of course ,COMMA that makes sense ,COMMA because hope is an abstract phenomenon ;SEMICOLON it's an abstract idea ,COMMA it's not a concrete word .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is a projection that can see the viewer as the viewer walks by .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it's sort of like a better version of the toolbar .PERIOD <BREAK>
there's a long history in astronomy of unlikely things turning out to be there .PERIOD and i mean ,COMMA the finest example of that was radio astronomy as a whole .PERIOD <BREAK>
none of them are taught in cooking schools .PERIOD <BREAK>
everybody talks about carbon taxes -- it won't work -- emission schemes ,COMMA but for example ,COMMA one policy measure ,COMMA feed-in tariffs on the energy system ,COMMA which is already applied ,COMMA from china doing it on offshore wind systems ,COMMA all the way to the u .PERIOD s .PERIOD <BREAK>
i could show you it with a cosmesis on it that's so real it's eerie ,COMMA but then you wouldn't see all this cool stuff .PERIOD <BREAK>
now what about the money ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and it's an object with fascinating stories and stories that are by no means over yet .PERIOD <BREAK>
four out of five animals on earth are nematode worms -- if all solid materials except nematode worms were to be eliminated ,COMMA you could still see the ghostly outline of most of it in nematode worms .PERIOD <BREAK>
surely that causes people to overestimate the likelihood that they'll be hurt in these various ways ,COMMA and gives power to the very people who want to frighten us .PERIOD <BREAK>

all the theories in physics that we have today properly explain what is called normal matter -- the stuff that we're all made of -- and that's four percent of the universe .PERIOD <BREAK>
using straw bale construction ,COMMA creating heat walls .PERIOD <BREAK>
and no matter what i say ,COMMA you cannot untie me from the mast .PERIOD <BREAK>
and what i'd like to talk about is how can we use that feeling to actually create a movement through film ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
watch it as it rotates back again .PERIOD and this is a very bright audience ,COMMA all right ?QUESTIONMARK see if you can stop it from happening ,COMMA even though you know <NUM> percent it's true that -- bam !EXCLAMATIONMARK you can't undo it .PERIOD what does that tell you about yourselves ?QUESTIONMARK we're going to do it again .PERIOD no doubt about it .PERIOD see if you can stop it from happening .PERIOD no .PERIOD it's difficult .PERIOD <BREAK>
a trivial example is this :COLON newton found the law of gravity ,COMMA which goes like one over the square of the distance between the things gravitated .PERIOD <BREAK>
start all over again .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so what the message is ,COMMA is not any message that they transmit from one ant to another ,COMMA but the pattern .PERIOD <BREAK>
all of them come from the cameras of american soldiers .PERIOD <BREAK>
so extroverts really crave large amounts of stimulation ,COMMA whereas introverts feel at their most alive and their most switched-on and their most capable when they're in quieter ,COMMA more low-key environments .PERIOD <BREAK>
do the monkeys do anything like this ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and they build a big ,COMMA complex world .PERIOD <BREAK>
here's a real simple example .PERIOD <BREAK>
we need to begin to manage this planet as if our life depended on it ,COMMA because it does ,COMMA it fundamentally does .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it was while i was doing my ph .PERIOD d .PERIOD <BREAK>
but not until <NUM> did mathematicians actually understand how they could model it .PERIOD <BREAK>
and that is exactly what causes the warping of my visual image .PERIOD <BREAK>
so if my voice can touch you ,COMMA if my actions can touch you ,COMMA if my being here can touch you ,COMMA please let it be .PERIOD <BREAK>
because this is what you will take away from here ,COMMA a reconnection with nature ,COMMA i hope .PERIOD <BREAK>
the last thing that i would just like to say ,COMMA when i'm talking to the police about what a perfect non-lethal weapon would look like ,COMMA they almost inevitably say the same thing .PERIOD <BREAK>

that was it .PERIOD that's all he saw as the options .PERIOD and not too far off .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's about <NUM> percent of the size of english .PERIOD <BREAK>
huntington ,COMMA west virginia .PERIOD <BREAK>
and only <NUM> people survived that journey .PERIOD <BREAK>
because this is exactly what our ancestors ,COMMA the homo erectus ,COMMA did .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA if you know you have these kleptoparasitic bees ,COMMA you know that your environment is healthy ,COMMA because they're top-of-the-food-chain bees .PERIOD <BREAK>
it doesn't .PERIOD <BREAK>
now ,COMMA at that time ,COMMA the entity ,COMMA the legal cartel ,COMMA that controlled the performance rights for most of the music that would be broadcast using these technologies was ascap .PERIOD <BREAK>
that's the end .PERIOD <BREAK>
put your book beneath it and you can read .PERIOD <BREAK>
i was not the only person editing the open street map .PERIOD <BREAK>
and this is such an inversion ,COMMA and such a wonderful example of children being the agents of change .PERIOD <BREAK>
this time ,COMMA he comes down .PERIOD <BREAK>
in other words ,COMMA we can't create supermodel mice .PERIOD <BREAK>
the people who actually have no money ,COMMA who have no extravagant budget ,COMMA but who realize that actually you might achieve greater success in uptake of a government program by actually doubling the level of benefits you pay ,COMMA but you'll probably achieve exactly that same effect simply by redesigning the form and writing it in comprehensible english .PERIOD <BREAK>
the most successful technology gets out of the way and helps us live our lives .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is euro disney ,COMMA and i've worked with all of the guys that presented to you earlier .PERIOD <BREAK>
and then ,COMMA there's business model issues about how to try to effectively market it and get it to people .PERIOD <BREAK>
i don't have a good answer for this one .PERIOD <BREAK>
harvest contaminated tobacco .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so if you ask this question :COLON where would you look to see the future of education ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
that's what it looks like looking down it .PERIOD <BREAK>
that's the news from downtown .PERIOD here it is in perspective .PERIOD <BREAK>
we have an absolute rule that if our data source has data for one of the countries we're looking at ,COMMA it goes into the analysis .PERIOD <BREAK>
you'll be able to figure that out .PERIOD <BREAK>
cheers .PERIOD <BREAK>
that's nothing ,COMMA compared to all of the other things we may be trying to do about energy .PERIOD <BREAK>
at <NUM> minutes i started feeling throbbing sensations in my legs ,COMMA and my lips started to feel really strange .PERIOD <BREAK>
now you may reason that we have one to perceive the world or to think ,COMMA and that's completely wrong .PERIOD <BREAK>
i thought this was a little strange at the time .PERIOD <BREAK>
it takes about four weeks to grow these cells from the organ .PERIOD <BREAK>

i merely ,COMMA most respectfully ,COMMA return him the ticket .PERIOD <BREAK>
some of them are kind of cool looking .PERIOD it's like hey ,COMMA why didn't they try that ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
darwin is a great example of this .PERIOD <BREAK>
and for good reason .PERIOD <BREAK>
so it's really unexplained as to why we need to put it in .PERIOD <BREAK>
luckily ,COMMA this year's flu was relatively mild .PERIOD <BREAK>
and you might think ,COMMA well ,COMMA boy ,COMMA your life support system was failing you .PERIOD wasn't that dreadful ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
you can make free unlimited calls home to the us with these phones .PERIOD so ,COMMA very ,COMMA very interesting .PERIOD <BREAK>
this one is called what the fuck was i thinking ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>

four hundred million dollars ,COMMA which was real money back in the ' <NUM> s .PERIOD <BREAK>
you might know that chemistry is the science of making molecules -- or to my taste ,COMMA new drugs for cancer .PERIOD <BREAK>
and you're in a restaurant ,COMMA and you say ,COMMA well how old are you ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
on the other hand ,COMMA we don't seem to have been visited by aliens .PERIOD <BREAK>
the perverse at heart will seek out the ambiguities ,COMMA trying to create discord by pinning down meanings of their own .PERIOD <BREAK>
don't get me wrong ,COMMA i don't mind playing bad guys .PERIOD <BREAK>

i was using my ipod to play the leonard cohen song 'i'm your man' for my doctors and nurses .PERIOD <BREAK>
and with biomimicry ,COMMA if you've got an underutilized resource ,COMMA you don't think ,COMMA how am i going to dispose of this ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
that stuff's cool .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i don't even mean ,COMMA like ,COMMA because of the toes and everything .PERIOD <BREAK>
she knew it was a hallucination .PERIOD <BREAK>
these are two genes that we found as good examples .PERIOD <BREAK>
but then i realized that we humans are not actually interested in computing .PERIOD <BREAK>
they can unite .PERIOD they can come together .PERIOD if people would stop ,COMMA lives will be saved .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the solution here ,COMMA in my view ,COMMA is a private solution ,COMMA a solution that looks to legalize what it is to be young again ,COMMA and to realize the economic potential of that ,COMMA and that's where the story of bmi becomes relevant .PERIOD <BREAK>
so we tried to look at all the different heat engines that have been used in history to try and convert sunlight to electricity ,COMMA or heat to electricity .PERIOD <BREAK>
and then an enormous accident took place .PERIOD <BREAK>
i am for the second option ,COMMA and i'm sure many of you are .PERIOD <BREAK>
what we really want is to arrive right here ,COMMA so we can stop the epidemic .PERIOD <BREAK>
she's <NUM> ,COMMA by the way ,COMMA and she does things with her computer screen and a touch pad that she can do faster than most humans .PERIOD <BREAK>
i didn't know what to do with my life ,COMMA but i was told if you follow your passion ,COMMA it's going to work out .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's a feature-length documentary on consciousness .PERIOD <BREAK>
so i developed a whole range around -- mass-produced range -- that obviously fitted into a much higher-end decor market that could be exported and also service our local market .PERIOD <BREAK>
but we know for sure that what we want to do today is take one child at a time ,COMMA not get bogged with numbers ,COMMA and actually see the child complete the circle of life ,COMMA and unleash his total potential .PERIOD <BREAK>
take a look at this picture .PERIOD <BREAK>
that's what progress is about .PERIOD <BREAK>
well ,COMMA we did pull through on this planet .PERIOD <BREAK>
i'm an ignostic .PERIOD <BREAK>
now ,COMMA i want to stress that none of these peoples that i've been quickly talking about here are disappearing worlds .PERIOD <BREAK>
back then -- actually my first expedition was when i was <NUM> years old .PERIOD it was <NUM> years ago .PERIOD <BREAK>
and where it has led in origami is to things like this .PERIOD <BREAK>
that is the resource that i'm talking about .PERIOD <BREAK>
and then they played around with it a little bit more ,COMMA and they talked to a couple of their colleagues who had other kind of specialties .PERIOD <BREAK>
the next morning she was dead .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the whole room ,COMMA including me ,COMMA was like ,COMMA yeah .PERIOD <BREAK>
comparing it with a typical building ,COMMA what happens if we seek to use such design strategies in terms of really large-scale thinking ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and it wasn't until ,COMMA on one of my later viewings ,COMMA that the veil was lifted and it was in a scene where he's walked across the sinai desert and he's reached the suez canal ,COMMA and i suddenly got it .PERIOD <BREAK>
each one of those is a year .PERIOD <BREAK>
but perhaps the most challenging part was to convince the regulators -- a matter which was debated in the parliament -- that a young female surgeon be allowed the opportunity to pioneer for her country .PERIOD <BREAK>
in so doing ,COMMA the guardians of secular democracy in effect yield the connection between education and values to fundamentalists ,COMMA who ,COMMA you can be sure ,COMMA have no compunctions about using education to further their values :COLON the absolutes of a theocracy .PERIOD <BREAK>
we're actually injecting contrast into the organ .PERIOD <BREAK>

i was a noticeable nobody .PERIOD <BREAK>
anyway ,COMMA i went home that night .PERIOD i thought about it .PERIOD <BREAK>
so i'd like to take the idea that rory sutherland talked about ,COMMA this notion that intangible things are worth perhaps more than physical things ,COMMA and take that a little bit further and say that i think the design of participatory systems ,COMMA in which many more forms of value beyond simply cash are both created and measured ,COMMA is going to be the major theme ,COMMA not only for design ,COMMA but also for our economy as we go forward .PERIOD <BREAK>
as i realized ,COMMA just like with many many things in my life that i actually love ,COMMA i adapt to it .PERIOD <BREAK>
so the project really addresses these three core issues in a new and exciting way ,COMMA i think .PERIOD <BREAK>
consider sending somebody to nashville .PERIOD pick well .PERIOD <BREAK>
they fall apart ,COMMA they disintegrate ,COMMA and they end up here .PERIOD <BREAK>
we basically gave children a very simple challenge .PERIOD <BREAK>
and my experience is that ,COMMA when i'm talking to her ,COMMA with every second that passes during our conversation ,COMMA the feeling of love that binds us is bringing us closer and closer together .PERIOD <BREAK>
so another challenge for our generation is to create global institutions that reflect our ideas of fairness and responsibility ,COMMA not the ideas that were the basis of the last stage of financial development over these recent years .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the surgeons grabbed hold of it and said ,COMMA well ,COMMA i want to hold it like this ,COMMA or like that .PERIOD <BREAK>
the non-players never come out -- they die .PERIOD <BREAK>
and we will soon see china coming up in the very far end corner here .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i will talk you through all of these and demonstrate how they work ,COMMA exclusively using examples of people getting stuff wrong .PERIOD <BREAK>
and after that ,COMMA the complete fragrance .PERIOD <BREAK>
they're ingenious ,COMMA perhaps ,COMMA but not analytical ,COMMA and when these concepts underly our teaching and what we think about the world ,COMMA then we have a problem ,COMMA because we stymie support for everything .PERIOD <BREAK>
we're still trying to explain and come to terms with what is the evolutionary advantage of this .PERIOD <BREAK>
they showed bloody gums .PERIOD <BREAK>
i said ,COMMA but you know ,COMMA i bought an airline ticket ,COMMA and i'm stuck here for a week .PERIOD <BREAK>
so what are we looking for in a meal ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>

basically ,COMMA it ends up as god is on a bicycle with his angels .PERIOD <BREAK>
a lot of work happens in companies from people knowing each other ,COMMA and informally .PERIOD <BREAK>
you read about it ,COMMA you hear about it .PERIOD <BREAK>
the memorable ,COMMA i think ,COMMA is really our world ,COMMA what we think the world is .PERIOD <BREAK>

this program started with <NUM> schools and spread to <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> government schools .PERIOD <BREAK>

all the peoples that the babylonians had repressed and removed will go home ,COMMA and they'll take with them their gods .PERIOD <BREAK>
the pc virus problem is <NUM> years old now .PERIOD <BREAK>
and who knows ?QUESTIONMARK somebody will license this technology and develop marketable products ,COMMA and she would get revenue .PERIOD <BREAK>
so this is china ,COMMA a civilization-state ,COMMA rather than a nation-state .PERIOD <BREAK>
and thanks to that ,COMMA turkey has been able to reasonably create a success story in which islam and the most pious understandings of islam have become part of the democratic game ,COMMA and even contributes to the democratic and economic advance of the country .PERIOD <BREAK>
but i had always felt like ,COMMA look ,COMMA you know ,COMMA i made the best choice i could make given who i was then ,COMMA given the information i had on hand .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i decided to try to get smarter by reading the entire encyclopedia britannica from a to z -- or ,COMMA more precisely ,COMMA from a-ak to zywiec .PERIOD <BREAK>
and once this display gets going ,COMMA i'm not touching it anymore .PERIOD <BREAK>
he's in his study ,COMMA it's october of <NUM> ,COMMA and he's reading malthus ,COMMA actually ,COMMA on population .PERIOD <BREAK>

instead of using electrical motors ,COMMA electromechanical actuators ,COMMA we're using compressed air .PERIOD <BREAK>
its cars are made from <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> components .PERIOD <BREAK>
now most people think that's because plastics are a throw-away material ,COMMA have very little value .PERIOD <BREAK>
uh ,COMMA neither .PERIOD <BREAK>
so then we're able to work with thousands and thousands of more students .PERIOD <BREAK>
i want to rob a bank in a film .PERIOD i want to rob a bank in a film ,COMMA but do it with a gun ,COMMA with a gun ,COMMA not with a bomb strapped around me ,COMMA right .PERIOD <BREAK>
okay ,COMMA ines .PERIOD <BREAK>
the getty here is moving their books to the ucla ,COMMA which is where we have one these scanning centers ,COMMA and scanning their out-of-copyright books ,COMMA which is fabulous .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA we can do <NUM> cents a page ,COMMA we're going <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> books a month and we've got about <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> books online ,COMMA counting all the other projects that are starting to add in .PERIOD <BREAK>
chinese had pioneered technologies like steel ,COMMA printing ,COMMA gunpowder .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's just phenomenal .PERIOD the one on the right was going up the hill .PERIOD <BREAK>
next is a compilation of a bunch of stuff .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it was just a little thing -- it wasn't good for much except text entry -- but my father had told me about moore's law ,COMMA about moore's law back in the ' <NUM> s ,COMMA and i knew what was coming .PERIOD <BREAK>
and that showed me such a fundamental truth ,COMMA that music making and other forms of creativity can so often go to places where mere words cannot .PERIOD <BREAK>
now ,COMMA over here there's great diversity :COLON that's where things are evolving fast .PERIOD <BREAK>
i just realized it's important how one introduces new ideas to people ,COMMA that's why these patents are sometimes necessary .PERIOD <BREAK>
but what i actually mostly do is i manage the pain management service at the packard children's hospital up at stanford in palo alto .PERIOD <BREAK>
or just think about american jazz or american movies -- they go everywhere .PERIOD <BREAK>
werner herzog ,COMMA the german filmmaker said ,COMMA i need to make movies like you need oxygen .PERIOD <BREAK>
in kenya ,COMMA in august ,COMMA i went to visit one of the v-day safe houses for girls ,COMMA a house we opened seven years ago with an amazing woman named agnes pareyio .PERIOD <BREAK>
i was so happy -- -- that my sister was alive !EXCLAMATIONMARK <BREAK>
so with all this success ,COMMA why isn't that good enough ,COMMA you might ask .PERIOD <BREAK>
this was two miles from where people go to sunbathe ,COMMA and they were oblivious to the existence of this system .PERIOD <BREAK>
the one ,COMMA we can call it the cynical design ,COMMA that means the design invented by raymond loewy in the ' <NUM> s ,COMMA who said ,COMMA what is ugly is a bad sale ,COMMA la laideur se vend mal ,COMMA which is terrible .PERIOD <BREAK>
there isn't a dog on this earth that's a natural creature .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so a new awareness will have to arise ,COMMA of how we deal with these ,COMMA how we mobilize ourselves ,COMMA in a new way ,COMMA and come together as a community to manage systemic risk .PERIOD <BREAK>
now ,COMMA fish like to stay close together ,COMMA about a body length apart .PERIOD <BREAK>
and furthermore ,COMMA that nervous tissue -- brain -- gets cancer ,COMMA and brain cells are also terminally differentiated .PERIOD <BREAK>
they're not there for looks .PERIOD <BREAK>
we're not talking here about a clash of civilizations .PERIOD <BREAK>
two days later ,COMMA the doctors gave the mitchells a choice :COLON they could either remove barbara off the life support ,COMMA in which case she would die within a matter of hours ,COMMA or they could keep her on life support ,COMMA in which case she might still die within a matter of days .PERIOD <BREAK>

she said ,COMMA oh it's wonderful .PERIOD how did you do that ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
it's perceptions ,COMMA thoughts ,COMMA feelings ,COMMA dreams .PERIOD <BREAK>
if we avoid that trap ,COMMA others are waiting for us .PERIOD <BREAK>
most important of all ,COMMA i didn't know what that was the first time i heard it .PERIOD <BREAK>
and what i'm trying to do with my work is put faces to this .PERIOD <BREAK>
this double front door here with the three-light transom that was headed to the landfill .PERIOD <BREAK>
lots of you can afford to buy one of these .PERIOD <BREAK>
booted up in a cell ,COMMA the program would execute ,COMMA and it could result in this person ;SEMICOLON or with a small change ,COMMA it could result in this person ;SEMICOLON or another small change ,COMMA this person ;SEMICOLON or with a larger change ,COMMA this dog ,COMMA or this tree ,COMMA or this whale .PERIOD <BREAK>
we want to know -- this is <NUM> years ago ,COMMA surely ,COMMA you're thinking ,COMMA we've figured it out by now .PERIOD <BREAK>
we started in ' <NUM> ,COMMA proposing for the city of rio how to connect the subway with the bus .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is one of the last repositories of the ganges river dolphin ,COMMA various species of turtles ,COMMA thousands of migratory birds ,COMMA and fishing is causing problems like this .PERIOD <BREAK>
i love this idea that came from the village level :COLON three keys to unlock that warehouse .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA the bigger problem with this logic is that it confuses the intended versus the actual uses of technology .PERIOD <BREAK>
to me ,COMMA it was immensely reassuring that the presiding spirit of this little methodist college in upstate south carolina was a holocaust survivor from central europe .PERIOD <BREAK>
we care how we make our profit .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the second question is ,COMMA will the machines want to take over ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and i got all these force measurements ,COMMA and then i went and looked at the force output of the system .PERIOD <BREAK>
for me that's winning ,COMMA regardless of all the details .PERIOD <BREAK>
in the second world war ,COMMA too ,COMMA the existence of solar radiation was demonstrated by studies of interference that was detected by the radar stations of great britain .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA einstein would like this .PERIOD <BREAK>
james burke :COLON you'll be pleased to know ,COMMA i'm sure ,COMMA that there are several ways to create a hypercard interactive video .PERIOD <BREAK>
so i did that .PERIOD <BREAK>
we're talking about top- <NUM> nielsen-rated shows over the course of <NUM> years .PERIOD <BREAK>
finally ,COMMA i want to say that before i came to speak here ,COMMA i was told that the principle of tedglobal is that the good speech should be like a miniskirt .PERIOD <BREAK>
well ,COMMA i'm glad rufus is bringing this up ,COMMA because you can notice where he dips in the first years where i think i was doing most of the work .PERIOD <BREAK>
so what i'm going to do is show you the distribution of matter as a function of scales .PERIOD <BREAK>
and what we learned is cesar's work is far too good to explain in the new york times magazine .PERIOD <BREAK>
we need to learn ,COMMA for example ,COMMA from dr .PERIOD cushing ,COMMA who killed patients in the course of his early operations .PERIOD <BREAK>
in a village ,COMMA you have <NUM> laptops ,COMMA each with a different set of <NUM> books ,COMMA and so that village suddenly has <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> books .PERIOD <BREAK>
the issue is how are we using what has been given back .PERIOD <BREAK>
they won't stand out ,COMMA they won't be ridiculed ,COMMA but they will be part of the in-crowd if they hurry .PERIOD <BREAK>
so how does this all relate to behavioral finance ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
thank you .PERIOD <BREAK>
laennec ,COMMA it is said ,COMMA was walking in the streets of paris and saw two children playing with a stick .PERIOD <BREAK>
warm-blooded animals take a huge hit at this time .PERIOD <BREAK>
and mantis shrimp are officially the fastest measured feeding strike of any animal system .PERIOD so our first surprise .PERIOD <BREAK>
and that was amazing -- to be able to know that we had empowered that ,COMMA and that blogging was something that she felt comfortable doing ,COMMA and that the idea that blogging doesn't have to be scary ,COMMA that we don't always have to be attack of the blogs ,COMMA that we can be people who are open ,COMMA and wanting to help and talk to people .PERIOD <BREAK>
and that fascinated me ,COMMA to explore that territory .PERIOD <BREAK>
so facial expressions -- as i mentioned before in emotional experiences -- are actually designed to work out of the box with some sensitivity adjustments available for personalization .PERIOD <BREAK>
do i do this three times a week ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
we also say there's going to be loads of other items of varying qualities and levels of excitement .PERIOD <BREAK>
if you could do this ,COMMA what you would find that with each passing day ,COMMA each passing year ,COMMA each passing billions of years ,COMMA ok ,COMMA the distance between galaxies is getting greater .PERIOD <BREAK>
this guy is no republican .PERIOD <BREAK>

my friend red maxwell has spent the last <NUM> years fighting against juvenile diabetes .PERIOD <BREAK>
each one has got two games .PERIOD <BREAK>
in this case ,COMMA the hand would move and we'd see it waving at us in middle world .PERIOD the odds against it ,COMMA of course ,COMMA are so great that if you set out writing zeros at the time of the origin of the universe ,COMMA you still would not have written enough zeros to this day .PERIOD <BREAK>
we see light reflected off the moon .PERIOD <BREAK>
these include ,COMMA of course ,COMMA climate .PERIOD <BREAK>
zesty .PERIOD <BREAK>

and of course habits are enforced by architecture .PERIOD <BREAK>
let's do something about it .PERIOD <BREAK>
in germany ,COMMA <NUM> percent check the box .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's just the idea that empty space itself has energy .PERIOD <BREAK>

but when i was <NUM> ,COMMA as i was in this picture ,COMMA a very exciting expedition was in place on the west side ,COMMA when they found essentially the skeleton of this homo erectus .PERIOD <BREAK>
so if you brush up against it ,COMMA any place you brushed against it ,COMMA you get this twinkling blue-green light that's just breathtaking .PERIOD <BREAK>
but it's also wrong about plants ,COMMA because plants are not just able to live ;SEMICOLON they are able to sense .PERIOD <BREAK>
my lost year was my jubilee year .PERIOD <BREAK>
we've got a problem with the antenna ringing .PERIOD <BREAK>
thank you .PERIOD <BREAK>
i think it's time for us to apply them to water .PERIOD <BREAK>
so we can also generate instructions on how to operate the controls of the vehicle .PERIOD <BREAK>
and when you have that ,COMMA then evolutionary theory tells us that natural selection will favor the more exploitative ,COMMA more predator-like organisms .PERIOD <BREAK>
six months later ,COMMA the women's infants were offered cereal mixed with carrot juice ,COMMA and their facial expressions were observed while they ate it .PERIOD <BREAK>
so the equivalent of the federal reserve bank in cambodia was bombed .PERIOD <BREAK>
and he goes ,COMMA oh ,COMMA this is great ,COMMA this is great .PERIOD <BREAK>
the kind of relationships when deep speaks to deep .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the catheters they shoved into me without proper medication made me scream out the way the earth cries out from the drilling .PERIOD <BREAK>
this tone used to mean bad news .PERIOD <BREAK>
islam came peacefully to the south ,COMMA slightly more differently complicated history in the north .PERIOD <BREAK>
and that's why so much of humor is the body asserting itself against the head .PERIOD <BREAK>
developments that have the potential to create positive returns for all concerned :COLON the developers ,COMMA government and the community where these projects go up .PERIOD <BREAK>
now even if we get to <NUM> miles per gallon by <NUM> ,COMMA which is our desire .PERIOD <BREAK>
but even at menstruation ,COMMA they're better than the average man .PERIOD <BREAK>
so here's a test system we developed .PERIOD <BREAK>
but i just wanted to say -- and i mean this without irony -- i think i can speak for everybody in the audience when i say that i wish to god that you were the president of the united states .PERIOD <BREAK>
people have died trying to do this kind of thing .PERIOD <BREAK>
what i really wanted was to be a graphic designer at one of the big design firms in new york city .PERIOD <BREAK>
i would look at the tongue .PERIOD <BREAK>
no problem .PERIOD yeah ,COMMA you know .PERIOD <BREAK>
so i snuck in a bunch of little wallet-sized pictures of the dalai lama ,COMMA and i would hand them out .PERIOD <BREAK>
i'm going to show you a clip now of the very first improvisation session that we had .PERIOD <BREAK>
but one has to wonder ,COMMA now that we've had this financial sector collapse upon us in iceland -- and by the way ,COMMA europe looks pretty bad right now ,COMMA and many would say that you in america are heading for some more trouble as well .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it was really a turning point in my life ,COMMA where i started to realize that i couldn't just go have fun doing science and exploration .PERIOD <BREAK>
and after doing this for a long time ,COMMA and the media lab passing the baton on ,COMMA i thought ,COMMA well ,COMMA maybe it's time for me to do a project .PERIOD <BREAK>
we had to run a control group to make sure that just coming into the laboratory didn't improve your mandarin skills .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i noticed that she was clowning around .PERIOD <BREAK>
i think you matter to god ;SEMICOLON i think you matter to history ;SEMICOLON i think you matter to this universe .PERIOD <BREAK>

i venture there are many in this room .PERIOD <BREAK>
that's a bono ,COMMA this is a bono .PERIOD <BREAK>
and even if they sometimes do nothing at all .PERIOD <BREAK>
one :COLON that society equates living in a permanent structure ,COMMA even a shack ,COMMA with having value as a person .PERIOD <BREAK>
which means television advertising is down <NUM> percent for nike .PERIOD <BREAK>
people don't have voice .PERIOD <BREAK>
here we go .PERIOD whoa !EXCLAMATIONMARK it's magnetic .PERIOD it doesn't pull the laptop onto the floor .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i'm just going to give two images out of a kind of company research project .PERIOD <BREAK>
and they've taken out the autoshop class and the drafting class and the art class .PERIOD <BREAK>
i'm trying to say we have to combine all the systems ,COMMA and with one condition :COLON never -- if you have a subway ,COMMA if you have surface systems ,COMMA if you have any kind of system -- never compete in the same space .PERIOD <BREAK>
child :COLON so ,COMMA that one is his .PERIOD <BREAK>
i was a very creative kid who read a lot ,COMMA and got into electronics first ,COMMA and then later ,COMMA programming computers ,COMMA when i was really young .PERIOD <BREAK>
they get samsung ,COMMA how can they be [a] developing country ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
this is a cartoon of the structure of phi x <NUM> .PERIOD <BREAK>

those mosquitoes are not infected .PERIOD <BREAK>
the freckles had grown and multiplied on her face and shoulders ,COMMA clustering into a kind of a tan .PERIOD <BREAK>
it’s classically learning by doing .PERIOD <BREAK>
then you notice that if that lego-provided cad program isn't enough ,COMMA there's an entire open-source ,COMMA third-party ,COMMA independent lego cad program that lets you do <NUM> d modeling and <NUM> d rendering and make ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA movies out of lego ,COMMA <NUM> d films of which there are thousands on youtube ,COMMA and some of them sort of mimicking famous films and some totally original content -- just beautiful -- and people recreating all sorts of things .PERIOD <BREAK>
so we started bringing in classes during the day .PERIOD <BREAK>
i was taking a class of his ,COMMA and he was just like ,COMMA this is an overeager student ,COMMA which we don't normally get in the united states ,COMMA because everyone else is cynical and jaded .PERIOD <BREAK>
when i look into these data images ,COMMA i see new things .PERIOD <BREAK>
maybe i should get away from this map completely ,COMMA and really be honest about wanting to show you my favorite bits and pieces of rome and simply kick a soccer ball in the air -- which happens in so many of the squares in the city -- and let it bounce off of things .PERIOD and i'll simply explain what each of those things is that the soccer ball hits .PERIOD <BREAK>
because if we can ,COMMA maybe we have a chance of actually discovering life somewhere else without being biased by things like amino acids .PERIOD <BREAK>
they are coupled to light receptors similar to the ones in your eyes .PERIOD <BREAK>
you know ,COMMA skiers pray for snow ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
boy :COLON racism ,COMMA oppression ,COMMA people like me not getting a break in life .PERIOD <BREAK>
so these brief examples that i've shown you give you an idea of the kind of work that we're doing at the university of california ,COMMA santa barbara ,COMMA to bring together ,COMMA arts ,COMMA science and engineering into a new age of math ,COMMA science and art .PERIOD <BREAK>
but there are companies .PERIOD <BREAK>
the sun is behind saturn ,COMMA so we see what we call forward scattering ,COMMA so it highlights all the rings .PERIOD and i'm going to zoom .PERIOD <BREAK>
what that means is that it's time to move to a new level of economic value .PERIOD <BREAK>
it stands up ,COMMA it walks -- very impressive .PERIOD <BREAK>
the ranges of stuff -- the red line is the mass extinction .PERIOD <BREAK>
darpa just gave steve <NUM> million dollars to lead an eight-institution project to begin the process of asking that question .PERIOD <BREAK>

we are one .PERIOD <BREAK>
each of us ,COMMA with a single step ,COMMA can take the world ,COMMA can bring the world a step closer to peace .PERIOD <BREAK>
most of you said u ,COMMA which is right .PERIOD <BREAK>
the birth of a delayed identical twin is not going to shake western civilization .PERIOD <BREAK>

you're going to meet milo for the first time .PERIOD <BREAK>

now up until that moment ,COMMA i would have thought that ,COMMA by age <NUM> ,COMMA one of the life skills that i had really nailed was tying my shoes .PERIOD <BREAK>
i can get the next image .PERIOD i can blend and transition .PERIOD <BREAK>
but what he was trying to do was to pump all the air out of there ,COMMA and see what would happen inside there .PERIOD <BREAK>
and these things occur within hours .PERIOD this is a study :COLON a high fat meal ,COMMA and within one or two hours blood-flow is measurably less -- and you’ve all experienced this at thanksgiving .PERIOD <BREAK>
girl <NUM> :COLON like ,COMMA if you were a girl and you were really adventurous and a real big tomboy ,COMMA you would think that girls' games were kinda sissy .PERIOD <BREAK>
galaxies form ,COMMA and generations of stars form in those galaxies ,COMMA and around one star ,COMMA at least one star ,COMMA is a habitable planet .PERIOD <BREAK>
so i used to work at mattel ,COMMA actually .PERIOD <BREAK>

the pressure here is <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> pounds per square inch .PERIOD <BREAK>
i just like ,COMMA throw it in .PERIOD <BREAK>
it will leave us no further along in the general expansion of humanity into space than we were <NUM> years ago .PERIOD <BREAK>

it happens because we have jammed so much into the base of the natural ocean pyramid that these bacteria clog it up and overfill onto our beaches .PERIOD <BREAK>

william gregory was convicted of rape and burglary .PERIOD <BREAK>
they're just living life ,COMMA and they end up just acting like that .PERIOD <BREAK>
the more intact ,COMMA the more complete ,COMMA [and] the more complex your food web ,COMMA the higher the resilience ,COMMA [and] the more likely that the system is going to recover from the short-term impacts of warming events .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the only other option open to them is to stop asking the questions .PERIOD <BREAK>
because my belief is ,COMMA if we can feel these issues ,COMMA if we can feel these things more deeply ,COMMA then they'll matter to us more than they do now .PERIOD <BREAK>
storm trooper costumes .PERIOD maps of middle earth -- that's one i hand-drew myself .PERIOD there's the dodo skeleton folder .PERIOD <BREAK>

i think it's there ,COMMA and i think we need to go look for it ,COMMA and i think it's underground .PERIOD <BREAK>
so there's a lot of projects out there trying to digitize books .PERIOD <BREAK>

just push them through ,COMMA good .PERIOD thank you .PERIOD <BREAK>
and keep going ,COMMA until the subject presses the button ,COMMA saying ,COMMA i see the change .PERIOD <BREAK>
then they can't get any larger because they don't have a blood supply ,COMMA so they don't have enough oxygen or nutrients .PERIOD <BREAK>
reserve component -- national guard reserves overwhelmingly sys admin .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the view of scientists about how coral reefs work ,COMMA how they ought to be ,COMMA was based on these reefs without any fish .PERIOD <BREAK>

we know the children died .PERIOD <BREAK>
lamta have been on natural gas for <NUM> years .PERIOD <BREAK>
but i think that the greater good is being served here by just allowing people -- there are very few places ,COMMA now ,COMMA where you can go and not have identity ,COMMA to be completely anonymous and say whatever you'd like .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the army took them ,COMMA and instead of bringing them to the police station ,COMMA they brought them to an enemy favela where they get chopped into pieces .PERIOD <BREAK>
but the thing i want you to think about when we think about conservatives -- not so much this issue of the <NUM> convention -- the thing to think about is this :COLON they go to church .PERIOD <BREAK>

if we have a positive view about the future then we may be able to accelerate through that turn ,COMMA instead of careening off a cliff .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is why spouses in happy marriages tend to think that their husband or wife looks much better than anyone else thinks that they do .PERIOD <BREAK>

they're not shy of hyperbole as you can see .PERIOD <BREAK>
it wins or loses at that point .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the religions that should be making a major contribution are instead seen as part of the problem .PERIOD <BREAK>
i felt this tap on my shoulder ,COMMA and i turned around to see this giant girl in a hoodie sweatshirt emerge from the crowd .PERIOD <BREAK>

now deceit carries on through the plant kingdom .PERIOD <BREAK>
a whole continent written off -- we do not have to stand for this .PERIOD <BREAK>

now help me not to be a beggar anymore .PERIOD <BREAK>
then i started thinking ,COMMA would it be possible to hook up a heart/lung bypass machine and have a surgery where it was a tube going into my artery ,COMMA and then appear to not breathe while they were oxygenating my blood ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
of course ,COMMA this was the holy grail of our industry ,COMMA and the fact that this guy is a global icon didn't help either ,COMMA because i'm sure if any of you ever stand in line at the grocery store ,COMMA you know -- we see his face constantly .PERIOD <BREAK>
thank you very much .PERIOD <BREAK>
charles and ray ,COMMA they didn't obsess about style for it's own sake .PERIOD <BREAK>

in the mind of a man and a woman ,COMMA we're looking constantly at the contradiction between male and female ,COMMA we're looking for harmony within each other .PERIOD <BREAK>
just to give you an example ,COMMA every single root apex is able to detect and to monitor concurrently and continuously at least <NUM> different chemical and physical parameters .PERIOD <BREAK>

well ,COMMA do you ever need to give robots respect ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
that sent me to an x-ray ,COMMA then to an mri .PERIOD <BREAK>
but you can use it to optionally heat hot water and that brings the efficiency up even higher because some of the heat that you would normally be rejecting ,COMMA you can now use as useful energy ,COMMA whether it's for a pool or hot water .PERIOD <BREAK>
ok .PERIOD so let's look at the space thing .PERIOD <BREAK>
here's the first example .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it'll be growing over the next few months .PERIOD <BREAK>
such beautiful food ,COMMA i enjoyed it .PERIOD it was so beautiful .PERIOD <BREAK>
and then again ,COMMA there is the fact that we are streamlined .PERIOD <BREAK>
and we can do this because tumor blood vessels are unlike normal ,COMMA healthy vessels we see in other places of the body :COLON they're abnormal ;SEMICOLON they're very poorly constructed ;SEMICOLON and ,COMMA because of that ,COMMA they're highly vulnerable to treatments that target them .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA their fortunes add up to zero .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is a view taken from camp three .PERIOD <BREAK>

in a phrase ,COMMA it's :COLON <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> years ago ,COMMA a man and his family walked across the middle east ,COMMA and the world has never been the same since .PERIOD <BREAK>

let's review them both .PERIOD first of all ,COMMA the megatrends .PERIOD <BREAK>
why do we choose paper ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
you know ,COMMA it's just ludicrous .PERIOD <BREAK>
well my theory is that it's happening because censorship actually is less effective than you think it is in many of those places .PERIOD <BREAK>
you have a cardboard box with a mirror in the middle ,COMMA and then you put the phantom -- so my first patient ,COMMA derek ,COMMA came in .PERIOD <BREAK>
but the first cause of waste is probably even buried in our dna .PERIOD <BREAK>
a few years ago ,COMMA gateway came out with flat screen tvs .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the calls that -- you know how they say ,COMMA your call may be recorded for quality assurance ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>

if you had a relationship with a penguin ,COMMA you'd see it in the same sort of way .PERIOD <BREAK>
well ,COMMA that's what happened in the indian ocean during the <NUM> el nino ,COMMA an area vastly greater than the size of north america and europe ,COMMA when <NUM> percent of all the corals bleached and a quarter of them died .PERIOD <BREAK>

the other thing i wanted to mention just briefly is that we have a tremendous ability and responsibility to provide people the right information ,COMMA and we view ourselves like a newspaper or a magazine -- that we should provide very objective information .PERIOD <BREAK>
so we started talking about climate change .PERIOD <BREAK>
in other words ,COMMA your position in life comes to seem not accidental ,COMMA but merited and deserved .PERIOD <BREAK>
spades ?QUESTIONMARK spades ,COMMA good .PERIOD <BREAK>
i think it's a great challenge .PERIOD <BREAK>
this could be similar to the campaign organized by homosexuals a few years ago ,COMMA although heaven forbid that we should stoop to public outing of people against their will .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is east asia ,COMMA and the light blue there is south asia .PERIOD <BREAK>
and this is the drama of this world which many call globalized ,COMMA is that asia ,COMMA arabic countries ,COMMA latin america ,COMMA are much more ahead in being healthy ,COMMA educated ,COMMA having human resources than they are economically .PERIOD <BREAK>
so the clock started ticking .PERIOD <BREAK>
so here standing up is basit .PERIOD <BREAK>
patients are experts on their own experience ,COMMA and they can share that experience with others .PERIOD <BREAK>
i heard stories that got inside my body .PERIOD <BREAK>
some of you may remember star wars kid ,COMMA the poor teenager who filmed himself with a golf ball retriever ,COMMA acting as if it were a light saber .PERIOD <BREAK>

they're not the largest number of people ,COMMA but they are some of the most expensive -- and in terms of the likelihood for domestic abuse ,COMMA drug and alcohol abuse ,COMMA poor performance by their kids in schools and also poor health as a result of stress .PERIOD <BREAK>
so this motivated me to become an orthopedic surgeon and to see if i couldn't focus on solutions for those problems that would keep me playing sports and not limit me .PERIOD <BREAK>
but it cannot do it alone .PERIOD <BREAK>
and this is a really emancipatory and political contribution to peace and reconciliation .PERIOD <BREAK>
every morning we have about <NUM> patients ,COMMA maybe more or less .PERIOD <BREAK>
now as we pull away from this world -- we're going to keep pulling away from the star now .PERIOD <BREAK>

right after he told me and my brother he was going to be separating from my mom ,COMMA i remember walking to a convenience store and getting a cherry cola .PERIOD <BREAK>

a recent study at uppsala university in sweden found that it's very difficult to frown when looking at someone who smiles .PERIOD <BREAK>
shame is that thing .PERIOD <BREAK>
middle world is the narrow range of reality which we judge to be normal ,COMMA as opposed to the queerness of the very small ,COMMA the very large and the very fast .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the linear modeling involved in that was some good stuff for my classroom ,COMMA but it eventually got me on good morning america a few weeks later ,COMMA which is just bizarre ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
so it was pretty interesting stuff .PERIOD <BREAK>
now we're going to rewind and just focus on the chromosomes and look at its structure and describe it .PERIOD <BREAK>
they might have been able to do it earlier .PERIOD <BREAK>
so you're you're really bored in the subway ,COMMA and you kind of stare at something .PERIOD <BREAK>
we've heard from bill gates recently .PERIOD <BREAK>

there we go .PERIOD <BREAK>
you see that i'm beginning to really lose control here and also hope .PERIOD <BREAK>
but it's still going to pay attention if something more significant comes into its field of view -- such as cynthia breazeal ,COMMA the builder of this robot ,COMMA from the right .PERIOD <BREAK>
the second element is that we wanted to have a life ,COMMA a better life where we can benefit through many things .PERIOD <BREAK>

this is just a road .PERIOD and it's not very big :COLON it's about <NUM> meters on one side ,COMMA <NUM> on the other .PERIOD <BREAK>

so despite the provocative title ,COMMA this presentation is really about safety and about some simple things that we can do to raise our kids to be creative ,COMMA confident and in control of the environment around them .PERIOD <BREAK>

you almost never hear someone say the office .PERIOD <BREAK>
my mother sent yams and rice ,COMMA and our old clothes ,COMMA to his family .PERIOD <BREAK>

we're going to go on a dive to the deep sea ,COMMA and anyone that's had that lovely opportunity knows that for about two and half hours on the way down ,COMMA it's a perfectly positively pitch-black world .PERIOD <BREAK>
now ,COMMA the angle will have changed a tiny bit ,COMMA so you can see that the reaction is different .PERIOD <BREAK>
and that proportion is primarily genetically determined .PERIOD <BREAK>
most of them did not go .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so it goes on .PERIOD <BREAK>
and really commenting ,COMMA you know ,COMMA based on the perception we have of the celebrities .PERIOD <BREAK>
i mean ,COMMA i cut through three years of engineering meetings ,COMMA design and system integration ,COMMA and introduced depthx -- deep phreatic thermal explorer .PERIOD <BREAK>
and you ,COMMA you get to share mine .PERIOD <BREAK>
they are still up here .PERIOD <BREAK>
so what was the conclusion over the six years of work ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>

the structure of el sistema is based on a new and flexible managing style adapted to the features of each community and region ,COMMA and today attends to <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> children of the lower and middle class all over venezuela .PERIOD <BREAK>

it was just frightening .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is the subjective height -- the height you saw of these guys at various points .PERIOD <BREAK>
we know the temples they built ,COMMA where people could come to experience a different reality .PERIOD <BREAK>

they've been in use ,COMMA in architecture ,COMMA since ancient times .PERIOD <BREAK>
then ,COMMA on the side ,COMMA we've got the web and ,COMMA increasingly ,COMMA the cloud ,COMMA which is fantastic ,COMMA but also -- in the regard in which an interface is fundamental -- kind of a distraction .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so i finally got to this city ,COMMA and i'd done a little fractal model for the city just to see how it would sort of unfold -- but when i got there ,COMMA i got to the palace of the chief ,COMMA and my french is not very good ;SEMICOLON i said something like ,COMMA i am a mathematician and i would like to stand on your roof .PERIOD <BREAK>

you place the vascular blood vessel lining cells on the inside .PERIOD <BREAK>
i saw first-hand a system that is incredibly complex and then at the same time ,COMMA like everything beautiful in nature ,COMMA is utterly simple .PERIOD <BREAK>
but then we realized ,COMMA there's actually a way to solve both these problems with the same solution .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it actually was the right choice ,COMMA probably ,COMMA to try to make it out -- this way .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i said ,COMMA ok ,COMMA what did i do ?QUESTIONMARK what's going on ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and i'm going to show you why .PERIOD <BREAK>
i'm not sure what the future of video games holds for our civilization .PERIOD <BREAK>

and on the basis of several points ,COMMA the oceans are complex ,COMMA and they're central to the life on earth .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i think you can see around us now ,COMMA some of the green shoots of a very different kind of economy and capitalism which could grow .PERIOD <BREAK>
so give me the paper for nine months .PERIOD i'll give it back to you .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is what's really cool :COLON it's aging more slowly .PERIOD <BREAK>

the world has other universal languages .PERIOD <BREAK>

moving on from this ,COMMA the next person to explore this field was a gentleman called hans jenny in the <NUM> s .PERIOD <BREAK>

now ,COMMA superfly ,COMMA the concept is you take all the freedoms you normally associate with the flytower ,COMMA and you smear them across flytower and auditorium .PERIOD <BREAK>
cars are all wrong .PERIOD <BREAK>
that just taking a field and banging all these things out isn't necessarily the most efficient way that they could work .PERIOD <BREAK>
so that's a really symbolic pasting ,COMMA because that's the first one we did that you couldn't see from the city .PERIOD <BREAK>
you're more cautious .PERIOD you're more vigilant .PERIOD <BREAK>
mbi generates four images per breast .PERIOD <BREAK>

and they're understanding more about quantum mathematics .PERIOD <BREAK>
one of the greatest studies that we've been finding is that many times investors would ask this question -- what is a scalable model ?QUESTIONMARK -- as if the need of a community ,COMMA which is only located in a space and time and has those needs only located in those places ,COMMA has no legitimate right to get them for free because it's not part of a larger scale .PERIOD <BREAK>

they had a notion ,COMMA a platonic notion ,COMMA of what tomato sauce was .PERIOD <BREAK>

these are two women .PERIOD <BREAK>
c'mon ,COMMA c'mon .PERIOD martial arts ,COMMA games .PERIOD c'mon .PERIOD <BREAK>

it's about how many shining eyes i have around me .PERIOD <BREAK>
we can do it within <NUM> years ,COMMA and if we do succeed ,COMMA we will send to ted ,COMMA in <NUM> years ,COMMA a hologram to talk to you .PERIOD thank you .PERIOD <BREAK>
so this is a query that we had -- i guess it's a popular band that was more popular in some parts of the world than others .PERIOD <BREAK>

not that you know how long number <NUM> actually is ,COMMA but you would be able to compare number <NUM> against the pantheon with number <NUM> against the baths of caracalla ,COMMA and so on and so forth .PERIOD if you were interested .PERIOD <BREAK>

the right of peoples to live together in the same state ,COMMA worshiping differently ,COMMA freely -- a middle east ,COMMA a world ,COMMA in which religion is not the subject of division or of debate .PERIOD <BREAK>
language is a parasite that we've adapted to ,COMMA not something that was there originally for our genes ,COMMA on this view .PERIOD <BREAK>

when i saw aicha in the media ,COMMA coming over when her son was indicted ,COMMA and i thought ,COMMA what a brave woman .PERIOD <BREAK>

now ,COMMA how do i do this ,COMMA and where do i do this ,COMMA and all of that sort of thing .PERIOD <BREAK>

so you have to make a living cartooning .PERIOD <BREAK>

sustainability is complicated but dinner is a reality that we all very much understand .PERIOD <BREAK>

you're underneath it ,COMMA looking up into the lens of the camera obscura .PERIOD <BREAK>
people's attention span after <NUM> minutes begins to drop off ,COMMA tests have shown .PERIOD <BREAK>
so you can't tell much from just making the ball drop there ,COMMA but if we drop the ball and run the movie at the same time ,COMMA we can see that we have come up with an accurate physical model .PERIOD <BREAK>
now another way we try to increase our happiness is we medicate ourselves .PERIOD <BREAK>
i think understanding social networks and how they form and operate can help us understand not just health and emotions but all kinds of other phenomena -- like crime ,COMMA and warfare ,COMMA and economic phenomena like bank runs and market crashes and the adoption of innovation and the spread of product adoption .PERIOD <BREAK>
the skeletal remains from that period have shown that they were grinding grain morning ,COMMA noon and night .PERIOD <BREAK>

i am going to cite the possibility of being whole ,COMMA which is within our experience ,COMMA everybody's experience .PERIOD <BREAK>
you've only got to say ,COMMA do you remember seeing lots of dragonflies .PERIOD <BREAK>

and i would like it to be ethiopia .PERIOD <BREAK>
that was a big unification for those days ,COMMA although today we take it for granted .PERIOD <BREAK>
most people are guilty of the evil of inaction ,COMMA because your mother said ,COMMA don't get involved .PERIOD mind your own business .PERIOD <BREAK>

i have also an audible altimeter .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i would hold ,COMMA immediately after ,COMMA for five and half minutes .PERIOD <BREAK>
and rumi's stories are metaphors for the spiritual path .PERIOD <BREAK>
so out went the green scrubs and in came the polyester and floral prints .PERIOD <BREAK>
so while we want to make economic profit for ourselves and our customers ,COMMA we are willing to do it with a long-term view ,COMMA and we like to have a wider definition of profits than just the economic profit in the next quarter .PERIOD <BREAK>
in his great novel ,COMMA the brothers karamazov ,COMMA dostoevsky gives these words to ivan ,COMMA addressed to his naive and devout younger brother ,COMMA alyosha :COLON if the sufferings of children go to make up the sum of sufferings which is necessary for the purchase of truth ,COMMA then i say beforehand that the entire truth is not worth such a price .PERIOD <BREAK>

but i learned that there was a desperate shortage of skills ,COMMA especially mathematical skills ,COMMA in industry ,COMMA in government ,COMMA in education .PERIOD <BREAK>
i was in dubai .PERIOD and there's a lot of indians who work in dubai .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it is in the total of all those acts that the history of this generation will be written .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA it's not a question of if ,COMMA but a question of when peak oil will come upon us .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i think i scared him -- because he basically promised me -- we had no product -- but he said ,COMMA we'll give you a paragraph in the arts section if you'll just go away .PERIOD <BREAK>
mrs .PERIOD young-soon han .PERIOD <BREAK>

we've put all of that together into one thing ,COMMA and i'll show you what that synthesis looks like .PERIOD <BREAK>
congo has five of the world's richest sites of protected area ,COMMA and the okapi faunal reserve is one of them .PERIOD <BREAK>
and he says ,COMMA cause that's where all the money is .PERIOD <BREAK>
but even at the top ,COMMA there seems to be a small benefit to being in a more equal society .PERIOD <BREAK>
and pretty early on ,COMMA those storms started making their presence known .PERIOD <BREAK>
you don't choose the written word .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i think the reason this image works ,COMMA again ,COMMA is because frieda is driving the bulldozer .PERIOD <BREAK>
that set me on the road to examining biomechanics .PERIOD <BREAK>
and several things are important .PERIOD <BREAK>
she did cats and phantom of the opera .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's really difficult for me to listen to fijian music .PERIOD <BREAK>
i've also been working with the guardian on a topical basis -- a page a week in their newspaper -- which has been very interesting ,COMMA working topically .PERIOD <BREAK>
we're going to figure something out for the next <NUM> years ,COMMA and try it .PERIOD <BREAK>

you can see that corporations were illegal at the founding of america ,COMMA and even thomas jefferson complained that they were already bidding defiance to the laws of our country .PERIOD <BREAK>
so i've shown you some of the first generation of retrofits .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i was really surprised when i started to do this ,COMMA to see that ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA even those people who were advocating the use of non-lethal weapons by the military hadn't actually done that .PERIOD <BREAK>
and one thing that's very important is to combine traditional tabular data with three-dimensional and geospatial information .PERIOD <BREAK>
we find that premise quite exciting .PERIOD <BREAK>
so for example ,COMMA in the case of ticketmaster ,COMMA the reason you have to type these distorted characters is to prevent scalpers from writing a program that can buy millions of tickets ,COMMA two at a time .PERIOD <BREAK>
but how does it happen ?QUESTIONMARK did you see him turning pages in the score ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
this is the equivalent to the entire american corn crop failing along with all of our fruit crops ,COMMA as well as wheat ,COMMA tobacco ,COMMA rice ,COMMA sorghum -- whatever sorghum is -- losing sorghum .PERIOD <BREAK>

and then ,COMMA you come back to me .PERIOD <BREAK>
now ,COMMA at least with seeds we have the potential for future life .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is a plot of frequency against time -- sort of like musical notation ,COMMA where the higher notes are up higher and the lower notes are lower ,COMMA and time goes this way .PERIOD <BREAK>
but the poorer countries in africa ,COMMA the low-income countries down here ,COMMA there the rates fall faster ,COMMA of the percentage infected ,COMMA because people still die .PERIOD <BREAK>
so when we see e equals mc squared come along ,COMMA from a poet's perspective ,COMMA we see energy as physics ,COMMA chemistry as mass ,COMMA and all of a sudden ,COMMA you get this biology .PERIOD <BREAK>
in the <NUM> s ,COMMA it was very fashionable to talk about getting prices right .PERIOD <BREAK>

i found fertility at birth ,COMMA and i looked at total fertility rate per woman .PERIOD <BREAK>
so it suggests that ,COMMA if we could have a therapeutic or a pill to take to replicate some of these effects in humans ,COMMA maybe we would have a way of combating lots of different age-related diseases all at once .PERIOD <BREAK>
and all of a sudden .PERIOD <BREAK>

the earth invented the computer internet for its own benefit ,COMMA and we now ,COMMA being the top organism on this planet ,COMMA are trying to allocate resources in order to protect the biosphere .PERIOD <BREAK>

it's easy to look at what i've said so far ,COMMA and say ,COMMA wait a minute ,COMMA i don't have what it takes to be that kind of leader .PERIOD <BREAK>

i found that longer steps were much more elegant .PERIOD <BREAK>
this internal sense of rightness that we all experience so often is not a reliable guide to what is actually going on in the external world .PERIOD <BREAK>
but we have to ask :COLON is it possible that our universe is just a plume off of some greater history ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
you'll find families like this who go out into the forest to find a tree ,COMMA cut it down and make charcoal out of it .PERIOD <BREAK>
one for extracting oxygen out of the deep-sea water ,COMMA another one which houses this chemosynthetic bacteria ,COMMA which takes the hydrothermal fluid -- that hot water that you saw coming out of the bottom -- and converts that into simple sugars that the tube worm can digest .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is a long-term solution .PERIOD <BREAK>
well ,COMMA many theories .PERIOD but how could something tie them together ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and we actually had to install white walls to separate these pieces ,COMMA which didn't belong together .PERIOD <BREAK>

they sell off the assets .PERIOD <BREAK>
i asked everybody ,COMMA more or less ,COMMA to put their documents -- i said ,COMMA could you put your documents on this web thing ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
i think i heard somebody talk about that before .PERIOD <BREAK>
and that's what we're doing .PERIOD so wikipedia -- you just saw the little demonstration of it -- it's a freely licensed encyclopedia .PERIOD it's written by thousands of volunteers all over the world in many ,COMMA many languages .PERIOD <BREAK>
and this is what they were building .PERIOD <BREAK>
so we have a physical plan of how to make this actually happen .PERIOD <BREAK>

they took a dna origami ,COMMA organized some carbon nano-tubes ,COMMA made a little switch ,COMMA you see here ,COMMA wired it up ,COMMA tested it and showed that it is indeed a switch .PERIOD <BREAK>
so i'm sitting here looking at the next two decades of my life ,COMMA this chasm of happiness that we're driving our proverbial convertible straight into .PERIOD <BREAK>

our first task was a <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> -letter code bacteriophage ,COMMA a virus that attacks only e .PERIOD coli .PERIOD <BREAK>
we feel that this is an important gesture .PERIOD <BREAK>
and then we have this tendency ,COMMA the career counselors and various people say things like ,COMMA artists are not analytical .PERIOD <BREAK>
and as you go up towards the top of the graph ,COMMA what you see is each dot is a trial .PERIOD <BREAK>

we can weave them ,COMMA knit them ,COMMA or we can make them like you see here .PERIOD <BREAK>
and every single one of them has been placed .PERIOD <BREAK>
now that doesn't sound like a lot ,COMMA but it's very important ,COMMA because being able to deliver the transition as a light sport aircraft makes it simpler for us to certify it ,COMMA but it also makes it much easier for you to learn how to fly it .PERIOD <BREAK>
and just to sample the kind of interventions that we find have an effect ,COMMA when we teach people about the pleasant life ,COMMA how to have more pleasure in your life ,COMMA one of your assignments is to take the mindfulness skills ,COMMA the savoring skills ,COMMA and you're assigned to design a beautiful day .PERIOD <BREAK>

i had met a group of children in the caribbean island of saint kitts ,COMMA and i did work and play with them .PERIOD <BREAK>
and that was one of the reasons why the web wasn't quite as emergent as it could be because you needed two-way linking ,COMMA you needed that kind of feedback mechanism to be able to really do interesting things .PERIOD <BREAK>
but he was right ,COMMA it was a stupid idea .PERIOD <BREAK>
and they're not people who like to ask for help ,COMMA although they are the most helpful people ever .PERIOD <BREAK>
i'll show you what they look like .PERIOD <BREAK>
maybe it's something special in his brain that allows him to have language .PERIOD <BREAK>

as soon as he got to the lab ,COMMA even though he was the youngest ,COMMA he immediately saw that there was a problem with the making of forged documents .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i undertook this for two reasons .PERIOD <BREAK>
tag it .PERIOD attribute it .PERIOD metadata .PERIOD get the community to add local depth ,COMMA global perspective ,COMMA local knowledge .PERIOD <BREAK>
this results in declines in memory in cognition ,COMMA and in postural ability and agility .PERIOD <BREAK>
the kids who were going to be prisoners ,COMMA we said ,COMMA wait at home in the dormitories .PERIOD the study will begin sunday .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's a horrible situation .PERIOD <BREAK>

the reality of polio today is something very different .PERIOD <BREAK>
exactly what the students said was their concept about the world .PERIOD <BREAK>

alright ,COMMA so finally i'm going to spend the rest of the talk ,COMMA my last seven-and-a-half minutes ,COMMA on step one ;SEMICOLON namely ,COMMA how do we actually get to this moderate amount of life extension that will allow us to get to escape velocity ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
so once again ,COMMA using technology ,COMMA not just flipping the classroom ,COMMA you're humanizing the classroom ,COMMA i'd argue ,COMMA by a factor of five or <NUM> .PERIOD <BREAK>
or that could be good clinical targets for treating brain disorders .PERIOD <BREAK>
so it measures acceleration ,COMMA angular acceleration -- like a human ear ,COMMA inner ear .PERIOD <BREAK>
because long after this round of internationals left ,COMMA business would help keep her country peaceful and secure .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i'm pretty much the one who figured it out ,COMMA because i was a nerd .PERIOD <BREAK>
and as these tectonic plates are spreading apart ,COMMA magma ,COMMA lava is coming up and filling those gaps ,COMMA and you're looking land -- new land -- being created right before your eyes .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so our project is seeking to look at this readout ,COMMA understanding which of these <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> genes is turned on .PERIOD <BREAK>
and then re-crafting your life to use them as much as you possibly can .PERIOD <BREAK>
i actually shared that with some legislators here in the u .PERIOD s .PERIOD <BREAK>
you know ,COMMA between the environmental degradation and the crashing of the world markets you're talking about .PERIOD <BREAK>
so this next part is really a way of understanding space and rhythm ,COMMA with the obvious reference to the feet ,COMMA but it's also time -- where the feet were ,COMMA where the balls were .PERIOD <BREAK>
here's the selectivity index numbers -- against pox ,COMMA you saw <NUM> s and <NUM> s -- now against flu viruses ,COMMA compared to the ribavirin controls ,COMMA we have an extraordinarily high activity .PERIOD <BREAK>

it's a world of peace and prosperity and sustainability .PERIOD <BREAK>

they're as smart as chimpanzees in some respects .PERIOD <BREAK>

early filer and late filer .PERIOD <BREAK>
but they ain't going to pay for what others ,COMMA who have more money ,COMMA have largely created ,COMMA and i can agree on that .PERIOD <BREAK>
and that is what got kaluza thinking .PERIOD <BREAK>
but this is what helped me see it .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i decided to create a system that has all the properties that are necessary to see the evolution of complexity ,COMMA more and more complex problems constantly evolving .PERIOD <BREAK>
i was quite shocked by that ,COMMA and thought to myself ,COMMA well ,COMMA ok then .PERIOD <BREAK>
but not just that ;SEMICOLON also democracy ,COMMA parliament ,COMMA the idea of representation ,COMMA the idea of equal citizenship .PERIOD <BREAK>
it was my longest operation .PERIOD <BREAK>
i mean ,COMMA it is really very ,COMMA very scary the abuse that dogs get .PERIOD <BREAK>
and yet ,COMMA noaa has now shown us ,COMMA for example -- you see that little blue thing above hawaii ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
so i went onto twitter ,COMMA and i asked some people if they could explain to me cala a boca ,COMMA galvao .PERIOD <BREAK>
he said ,COMMA i can't do it .PERIOD <BREAK>
i first started to learn this most vividly from matthew sanford .PERIOD <BREAK>

over six million years ,COMMA we and the chimps evolved our different ways .PERIOD <BREAK>
we had six months to feel the lob ,COMMA to get the job done ,COMMA and we dicked around for six months .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA i wanted to say a few words about what an ordinary black hole is ,COMMA as if there could be such a thing as an ordinary black hole .PERIOD <BREAK>
and then i made it <NUM> more times ,COMMA and then it worked .PERIOD <BREAK>
the chicago board of trade was established then for precisely the same reasons that our farmers today would benefit from a commodity exchange .PERIOD <BREAK>
and then ,COMMA because you felt that satisfaction ,COMMA you're less motivated to do the actual hard work necessary .PERIOD <BREAK>
a dog that had never met capric acid would ,COMMA perhaps ,COMMA have no more trouble imagining its smell than we would have trouble imagining a trumpet ,COMMA say ,COMMA playing one note higher than we've heard a trumpet play before .PERIOD <BREAK>
i started out in chesapeake bay and went diving in the winter and became a tropical ecologist overnight .PERIOD <BREAK>
that's how they printed them in the old bibles .PERIOD <BREAK>
we really wanted to let them understand what the realities of parenting were in an honest way .PERIOD <BREAK>
but computers ,COMMA they can .PERIOD they don't need coffee breaks ,COMMA they don't need vacations ,COMMA they don't need to go to sleep at night ,COMMA they don't ask for raises either .PERIOD <BREAK>

so we offer teachers bonuses if the kids they teach score passing grades on these big test scores that are used to evaluate the quality of school systems .PERIOD <BREAK>
those who've been trained ,COMMA whose job it is to be the guardians of their society .PERIOD <BREAK>
and in the last years of the old regime ,COMMA he would routinely be detailed to go into the township to aggress the community .PERIOD <BREAK>
on average ,COMMA as a chinese in <NUM> ,COMMA you lived <NUM> years more than an average indian .PERIOD <BREAK>
you can go onto our website ,COMMA nationalgeographic .PERIOD com/genographic .PERIOD <BREAK>

the first really big health issue is a word that murray schafer coined :COLON schizophonia .PERIOD <BREAK>
well ,COMMA we could use the lifesaver bottle .PERIOD <BREAK>
second ,COMMA all the individuals have a tendency to line up .PERIOD <BREAK>
is that very common ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
well i don't have time to tell you about all the mathematics ,COMMA but underlying this is the social networks ,COMMA because this is a universal phenomenon .PERIOD <BREAK>
my talk essentially got written by three historic events that happened within days of each other in the last two months -- seemingly unrelated ,COMMA but as you will see ,COMMA actually all having to do with the story i want to tell you today .PERIOD <BREAK>
and biological pest control ,COMMA by the way ,COMMA or these good bugs that we are talking about ,COMMA they've existed in the world for thousands and thousands of years ,COMMA for a long ,COMMA long time .PERIOD <BREAK>
you can't raise money .PERIOD <BREAK>
when these things die ,COMMA immediately ,COMMA organisms come in and encrust and live on that dead surface .PERIOD <BREAK>

engineers like to look at systems like this .PERIOD scientists like to look at systems like this .PERIOD <BREAK>
we all know that technology ,COMMA entertainment and design have been and can be used for destructive purposes .PERIOD <BREAK>
look next time you get these catalogs in your mail -- you can usually figure out where they hid the cord .PERIOD <BREAK>
each has persisted for thousands to millions of years .PERIOD <BREAK>
but i just want to say that i've met girls with knife wounds and cigarette burns ,COMMA who are literally being treated like ashtrays .PERIOD <BREAK>
and here's the simple version of a foot for a new robot that i'll show you in a bit .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it is under seven feet tall ,COMMA so it will fit in a standard construction garage .PERIOD <BREAK>
i met benki three years ago in sao paulo when i'd brought him and other leaders from indigenous peoples to meet with me and leaders from around the world ,COMMA because we wanted to learn from each other .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is the reason why i created ,COMMA with david edward ,COMMA a scientist of harvard university ,COMMA an object able to absorb the toxic elements using those kind of plants .PERIOD <BREAK>
imagine their congratulations and their high image of you .PERIOD <BREAK>
the cliche of the radical architect is the sort of angry young man rebelling against the establishment .PERIOD <BREAK>
neither am i a veteran social worker .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so we did that ,COMMA and working with david ,COMMA we made a little company called applied proteomics eventually ,COMMA which makes this robotic assembly line ,COMMA which ,COMMA in a very consistent way ,COMMA measures the protein .PERIOD <BREAK>
they have to be all the time pointing toward the sun ,COMMA and they will be able to spread out in space ,COMMA because gravity on these objects is weak .PERIOD <BREAK>
so let's look at the most successful technology executive in the business and see how a presentation goes .PERIOD <BREAK>

but i managed to do it .PERIOD <BREAK>
so i want us now to think about not just two pieces of data being connected ,COMMA or six like he did ,COMMA but i want to think about a world where everybody has put data on the web and so virtually everything you can imagine is on the web and then calling that linked data .PERIOD <BREAK>
so many reactions involving enzymes and proteins are sensitive to the acid content of the ocean .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's really not a very friendly field for evolutionary biologists .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so we can actually extrapolate based on rates of discovery how many more species we're likely to discover .PERIOD <BREAK>
we talked to <NUM> drug addicts in three cities in indonesia ,COMMA and we said ,COMMA well ,COMMA do you know how you get hiv ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
so the idea is that we have this early period when we're completely protected .PERIOD <BREAK>

they took photographs ,COMMA they fed the photographs into their computer program ,COMMA and that computer program shaped a sand dune and then took that sand dune shape and turned it into -- at their instructions ,COMMA using standard software with slight modifications -- a set of instructions for pieces of wood .PERIOD <BREAK>

the real issue in cellular biology is we are never going to understand everything ,COMMA because it's a multidimensional problem put there by evolution .PERIOD <BREAK>
we do that for all the words and phrases that appear in those books ,COMMA and that gives us a big table of two billion lines that tell us about the way culture has been changing .PERIOD <BREAK>
so they get immune to sounds that scare them after awhile .PERIOD <BREAK>
targeted drugs ,COMMA genetic modification ,COMMA artificial intelligence ,COMMA perhaps even implants into our brains ,COMMA may change human beings themselves .PERIOD and human beings ,COMMA their physique and character ,COMMA has not changed for thousands of years .PERIOD <BREAK>

the next thing is that if you want to predict the effect of one species on another ,COMMA if you focus only on that link ,COMMA and then you black box the rest ,COMMA it's actually less predictable than if you step back ,COMMA consider the entire system -- all the species ,COMMA all the links -- and from that place ,COMMA hone in on the sphere of influence that matters most .PERIOD <BREAK>

that's what doing theoretical physics is like :COLON there are a lot of wipeouts .PERIOD <BREAK>
we worry more about how we're judged and seen by others ,COMMA whether we're regarded as attractive ,COMMA clever ,COMMA all that kind of thing .PERIOD <BREAK>

it starts with metal recyclers who shred our stuff into very small bits .PERIOD <BREAK>

what's the take-home message ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and what's so neat about it is how you accept that story .PERIOD <BREAK>
so this is how we sought to do it .PERIOD <BREAK>
and what happens is when we test people one week later ,COMMA a month later ,COMMA three months later ,COMMA they're both happier and less depressed .PERIOD <BREAK>
and there are two billion children in the world .PERIOD <BREAK>

we are seeing geysers of ice which are coming out of that planet ,COMMA which indicate that most likely there is an ocean ,COMMA you know ,COMMA below the surface .PERIOD <BREAK>

you put the stick in the powder to take the sacred ashes -- well ,COMMA they're not ashes ,COMMA they're burnt limestone -- to empower the coca leaf ,COMMA to change the ph of the mouth to facilitate the absorption of cocaine hydrochloride .PERIOD <BREAK>

i'm right-handed but i seem to have smudged that ink as well .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the distribution of japanese is totally different ,COMMA where we see a group of intermediate sounds ,COMMA which is known as the japanese r .PERIOD <BREAK>
so what we need to do is to figure out a way of looking at the things we do want to look at and make things transparent that we don't want to look at .PERIOD <BREAK>
he's planning to eat that fence for dinner .PERIOD <BREAK>
you follow instructions on nerve and you should end up on babble ,COMMA which we did .PERIOD <BREAK>
some of the stuff we share is stuff we've made out of what we've found ,COMMA and all of it horrifies those industries .PERIOD <BREAK>

these people work with the chinese restaurant model -- same principles ,COMMA different applications and different settings -- not the mcdonald's model .PERIOD <BREAK>
a meringue is made exactly the same way ,COMMA in my estimation ,COMMA as a bone .PERIOD <BREAK>

and that actually ,COMMA specifically as a starting point of the first sabbatical ,COMMA worked really well for me .PERIOD <BREAK>
that's why the global knives are so neat .PERIOD <BREAK>
and in this way ,COMMA i've been strengthening my platform and broadening my outreach .PERIOD <BREAK>
it wasn't flying microbes .PERIOD <BREAK>
they're not reading my brilliant article !EXCLAMATIONMARK <BREAK>
natasha wanted to introduce her brother and father to all the villagers ,COMMA and the day we showed up turned out to be a <NUM> -year-old man's birthday .PERIOD <BREAK>

today we talk of people as an asset .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA color enables us to see the similarities and differences between surfaces ,COMMA according to the full spectrum of light that they reflect .PERIOD <BREAK>

i'll read just one more .PERIOD i don't usually say that .PERIOD <BREAK>
so role-play is actually ,COMMA i think ,COMMA quite valuable when it comes to thinking about experiences .PERIOD <BREAK>
and we certainly care what happens with our technologies .PERIOD <BREAK>
how do you do that ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
you see we started working in eastern and central europe ,COMMA and moved to russia .PERIOD <BREAK>

this was actually the experiment .PERIOD so you can see the coils were somewhat larger .PERIOD <BREAK>
alcohol was the daytime beverage of choice .PERIOD <BREAK>
they are training themselves ,COMMA as many young animals do ,COMMA to the adult life where they will be called to track the sun all the day .PERIOD <BREAK>
now ,COMMA it may seem like there is less hope today than there was before .PERIOD <BREAK>
so i've had incredibly many women role models that have influenced who i am and where i am today .PERIOD <BREAK>
because the web of the spider ,COMMA it was sending me insane ,COMMA because i couldn't get the web to move off .PERIOD <BREAK>
she simply said to him ,COMMA abraham ,COMMA i'm going away from you now ,COMMA and i shall never return .PERIOD <BREAK>

this is terminal four at heathrow ,COMMA typical of any terminal -- big ,COMMA heavy roof ,COMMA blocking out the sunlight ,COMMA lots of machinery ,COMMA big pipes ,COMMA whirring machinery .PERIOD <BREAK>
after that ,COMMA things kind of got strange ,COMMA and i got thinking about the computer ,COMMA because the computer to me always ,COMMA kind of ,COMMA bothered me .PERIOD <BREAK>
but i found that there were some advantages to being in hollywood .PERIOD <BREAK>
so the music had been my therapy for me .PERIOD <BREAK>
so here's the first punch line :COLON cities have defused the population bomb .PERIOD <BREAK>
that big shield that you see outside ,COMMA that's a heat shield which is going to protect it .PERIOD <BREAK>
but i think they're entering a new age ,COMMA because technology makes sharing frictionless and fun .PERIOD <BREAK>
the other thing that's also interesting that's going on here is the fact that intelligence agencies -- and it doesn't matter who they are -- they all operate in an industry where their commodity is information ,COMMA or restricted access to information .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is the piece that i told you about .PERIOD <BREAK>
and this was true for all the pair-wise combinations of tasks .PERIOD <BREAK>
you can't have barriers ,COMMA because it breaks through your prejudices ,COMMA breaks through everything that you have as your mask ,COMMA that says ,COMMA i am this ,COMMA i am that ,COMMA i am that .PERIOD <BREAK>
we're going to try this at lunch ,COMMA and i'll explain a bit more about it ,COMMA but it's made not only with two types of pre-doughs -- this attempt ,COMMA again ,COMMA at bringing out flavor is to make a piece of dough the day before that is not leavened .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so i came up with the idea of the living self-portrait series .PERIOD <BREAK>

and everybody's best friend ,COMMA ahmadinejad .PERIOD how are things going for him ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and these await our discovery .PERIOD <BREAK>
no .PERIOD i think the actual answer is that once you reframe it ,COMMA once you get out of one set of stale expectations from a failed project that had its day ,COMMA but now ,COMMA for whatever reason ,COMMA is tarnished ,COMMA you can actually rekindle the kind of human kindness and sharing that something like this on craigslist represents .PERIOD <BREAK>

this trait also tells us a lot about the kinds of groups people join .PERIOD <BREAK>
you're going to find some interesting analogies in this physiology .PERIOD <BREAK>
without the photographic process ,COMMA you would never see this .PERIOD this is invisible .PERIOD <BREAK>
i approach each project with a new insecurity ,COMMA almost like the first project i ever did ,COMMA and i get the sweats ,COMMA i go in and start working ,COMMA i'm not sure where i'm going -- if i knew where i was going ,COMMA i wouldn't do it .PERIOD <BREAK>
they're making it all the way across to east africa .PERIOD <BREAK>

every technology is transformed and moved by others .PERIOD <BREAK>
we've worked on small schools ,COMMA we've funded scholarships ,COMMA we've done things in libraries .PERIOD <BREAK>

now ,COMMA that's just one story about oil ,COMMA and we could end it there and say ,COMMA well ,COMMA oil's going to last forever because ,COMMA well ,COMMA there's just a lot of it .PERIOD <BREAK>
in fact ,COMMA i think in the next decade ,COMMA without any question ,COMMA we will discover life on mars and find that it is literally ubiquitous under the soils and different parts of that planet .PERIOD <BREAK>
we're going to look at body play ,COMMA which is a spontaneous desire to get ourselves out of gravity .PERIOD <BREAK>
i have to serve .PERIOD <BREAK>
we've got to work on developing all these different kinds of minds .PERIOD <BREAK>
but why have we not any plantoid ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
now ,COMMA the weird thing is google lies ,COMMA because if i type design and emotion ,COMMA it says ,COMMA you don't need the 'and .PERIOD ' we do it anyway .PERIOD <BREAK>
but that changed ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and there are a lot of people doing this ,COMMA a lot of synthetic biologists doing this ,COMMA like craig venter .PERIOD <BREAK>
as the last dodo was dying ,COMMA spinoza was looking for a rational explanation for everything ,COMMA called eudaemonia .PERIOD <BREAK>
women can talk ;SEMICOLON black men ski ;SEMICOLON white men build strong buildings ;SEMICOLON we build strong suns .PERIOD <BREAK>

but it's also about collective engagement and about the unprecedented laboratory for observing what makes people tick and work and play and engage on a grand scale in games .PERIOD <BREAK>
so will evil prevail ?QUESTIONMARK is that the question ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
but it's maybe the conviction as monkey and homunculus we are .PERIOD <BREAK>
we generate brain maps of the body's interior and use them as the reference for all other maps .PERIOD <BREAK>
because something did .PERIOD <BREAK>
if the horse was in pain ,COMMA i wouldn't show you this slide .PERIOD <BREAK>
it is so much stranger than you think .PERIOD <BREAK>

well ,COMMA that's a big question .PERIOD these why questions ,COMMA particularly in genetics and the study of history in general ,COMMA are always the big ones ,COMMA the ones that are tough to answer .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the chance that some of it isn't more intelligent than ours is also a remote idea .PERIOD <BREAK>
and sometimes just taking an interest in the individual ,COMMA in the fellows you've met ,COMMA and the businesspeople you've met ,COMMA it can make a huge difference ,COMMA especially in africa ,COMMA because usually the individual in africa carries a lot of people behind them .PERIOD <BREAK>

before you answer that ,COMMA have a look at this map .PERIOD <BREAK>
the political vision of a terrorist organization is decided by the leadership ,COMMA which ,COMMA generally ,COMMA is never more than five to seven people .PERIOD <BREAK>

if you think it's funny ,COMMA bear in mind there is an organization called the american institute of wine economics ,COMMA which actually does extensive research into perception of things ,COMMA and discovers that except for among perhaps five or ten percent of the most knowledgeable people ,COMMA there is no correlation between quality and enjoyment in wine ,COMMA except when you tell the people how expensive it is ,COMMA in which case they tend to enjoy the more expensive stuff more .PERIOD <BREAK>
if it's battling hypothermia ,COMMA its organs can't develop normally ,COMMA resulting in a range of health problems from diabetes ,COMMA to heart disease ,COMMA to low i .PERIOD q .PERIOD <BREAK>
so the red one fires on this grid and the green one on this one and the blue on on this one .PERIOD <BREAK>
that's the system .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the basic objective of this work is not to just go out once and look at these individuals ,COMMA but to establish thousands of individuals in these populations that we would monitor continuously on a regular basis .PERIOD <BREAK>

these two curves are averages :COLON standard &amp ;SEMICOLON poor ,COMMA the blue one ;SEMICOLON and the red one is standard &amp ;SEMICOLON poor's from which the five biggest discontinuities are taken out .PERIOD <BREAK>

the digital revolution ,COMMA yes .PERIOD <BREAK>
they travel at exactly the same time with the same winds to make the crossing .PERIOD i know they travel at the same altitude .PERIOD <BREAK>

charles used to say ,COMMA the extent to which you have a design style is the extent to which you have not solved the design problem .PERIOD <BREAK>

but here ,COMMA brian captured a unique view by positioning himself underneath the boat when they threw the waste overboard .PERIOD <BREAK>
that's one of our bluefin at the monterey bay aquarium .PERIOD <BREAK>
so i wrote a book on my research .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i believe there are three different -- and i call them different because different interventions build them ,COMMA it's possible to have one rather than the other -- three different happy lives .PERIOD <BREAK>
so it really doesn't look like empire is a great explanation for the great divergence .PERIOD <BREAK>

and before i tell you about that ,COMMA i just have to tell you this one little picture of graffiti there i picked off the web the other day .PERIOD <BREAK>
we then take the parks and lay them out as ecological infrastructure .PERIOD <BREAK>
and we use this motor to apply force down to player one's fingers for three seconds and then it stops .PERIOD <BREAK>
you can see all types of resolution .PERIOD from here ,COMMA i can slowly pan the image over .PERIOD <BREAK>
so a tumor expresses chemokine receptors ,COMMA and another organ -- a distant organ somewhere in the body -- will have the corresponding chemokines ,COMMA and the tumor will see these chemokines and migrate towards it .PERIOD <BREAK>
okay .PERIOD <BREAK>
that's what we all need to do .PERIOD <BREAK>
the mathematics of quantum mechanics very accurately describes how our universe works .PERIOD <BREAK>
those organisms that paired with fungi were rewarded ,COMMA because fungi do not need light .PERIOD <BREAK>
we kill about <NUM> million sharks a year .PERIOD <BREAK>
and there is so much shared sense of what we need to do ,COMMA that it is vital that we all come together .PERIOD <BREAK>
it just goes to show how tough it is to come up with the right uses of media .PERIOD <BREAK>

there's many things about it .PERIOD it becomes very simple ,COMMA and basically what you're doing is you're just touching the machine ,COMMA you're touching the cloud and you're going to compute that way .PERIOD <BREAK>
gravity is also a field of forces that act on masses .PERIOD <BREAK>
she and i were both very pregnant at that time ,COMMA and my heart just ached for her ,COMMA imagining how afraid she must be .PERIOD <BREAK>
george gamow ,COMMA also a great physicist ,COMMA he designed the tie .PERIOD <BREAK>

i would just sum up the way things look ,COMMA at least from this secular perspective ,COMMA as far as compassion and the golden rule go ,COMMA by saying that it's good news that compassion and the golden rule are in some sense built into human nature .PERIOD <BREAK>
but here's the thing :COLON the stupidest possible creative act is still a creative act .PERIOD <BREAK>

and i did ,COMMA and we ended up naming it duterimbere ,COMMA meaning to go forward with enthusiasm .PERIOD and while we were doing it ,COMMA i realized that there weren't a lot of businesses that were viable and started by women ,COMMA and so maybe i should try to run a business ,COMMA too .PERIOD <BREAK>
and yet ,COMMA all the press is focused on that .PERIOD <BREAK>
we took about <NUM> or <NUM> architects and designers and artists ,COMMA and over four days -- it was like this urban barn-raising -- to renovate it ,COMMA and everyone wanted to help .PERIOD <BREAK>
rather than what we think that they might need .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA the approach that we started with is to ask :COLON is it really practical to make things of this sort ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
on one hand ,COMMA on the left bank of the river ,COMMA are the people like me who study those planets and try to define the environments .PERIOD <BREAK>
the syndrome ,COMMA the female-pattern now is called microvascular coronary dysfunction ,COMMA or obstruction .PERIOD <BREAK>
but if i say ,COMMA in spite of my body being limited -- if it is black it is not white ,COMMA if it is white it is not black :COLON body is limited any which way you look at it .PERIOD limited .PERIOD <BREAK>
so a hundred surgeries later ,COMMA he looks at his mom and says ,COMMA mom ,COMMA please pray for me .PERIOD i'm in so much pain .PERIOD <BREAK>
well ,COMMA there are many ways of approaching the functions of the human brain .PERIOD <BREAK>
and then we decided that we'd change it from english to dutch -- into het globale verwarmen .PERIOD <BREAK>
she said ,COMMA that's wei .PERIOD <BREAK>
so let me explain how this works .PERIOD <BREAK>
so we are now able to make very sophisticated motor planning ,COMMA things like that .PERIOD <BREAK>
never before in human history have so many people been raised out of such great poverty as happened in china .PERIOD <BREAK>
increasingly ,COMMA we are going to have to do business with people with whom we do not share values ,COMMA but with whom ,COMMA for the moment ,COMMA we share common interests .PERIOD <BREAK>
and this is a very widespread phenomena .PERIOD <BREAK>
i'm telling you this story ,COMMA because actually ever since richard called me and asked me to talk about -- as he asked all of his speakers -- to talk about something that would be new to this audience ,COMMA that we had never talked about ,COMMA never written about ,COMMA i've been planning this moment .PERIOD <BREAK>
the second is ,COMMA we're human .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's on par with united states in these two social dimensions .PERIOD <BREAK>
we create mountains of waste .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so what did we find ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
i think it's a great -- it's a celebration .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is exploring geometry and the rhythm of shape .PERIOD <BREAK>
let the science temper your knowledge a little bit .PERIOD <BREAK>
students love that tdp .PERIOD they think it's the name of a video game .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA chris said that the last speaker had a chance to try to integrate what he heard ,COMMA and so this was amazing for me .PERIOD i've never been in a gathering like this .PERIOD <BREAK>
and how about those cats ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and here -- again ,COMMA my favorite example -- is the cookbook ,COMMA the larousse gastronomique .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i use that word advisedly .PERIOD <BREAK>
it was a joke .PERIOD <BREAK>
but if you live in a vacuum ,COMMA if you live on the surface of one of these objects ,COMMA say ,COMMA in the kuiper belt ,COMMA this -- an object like pluto ,COMMA or one of the smaller objects in the neighborhood of pluto ,COMMA and you happened -- if you're living on the surface there ,COMMA and you get knocked off the surface by a collision ,COMMA then it doesn't change anything all that much .PERIOD <BREAK>
why are there even these penguins oiled ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
if you don't change that revenue picture ,COMMA if you don't solve what you're doing in health care ,COMMA you're going to be deinvesting in the young .PERIOD <BREAK>
if you want to be happy ,COMMA practice compassion .PERIOD <BREAK>
these freckles are called sunspots ,COMMA and they are just one of the manifestations of the sun's magnetic field .PERIOD <BREAK>
you are one third as productive in open-plan offices as in quiet rooms .PERIOD <BREAK>
no ,COMMA you're not .PERIOD <BREAK>
and inflation has come down .PERIOD <BREAK>
there were wonderful experiments by bruno munari on letterforms some years ago -- sort of ,COMMA see how far you could go and still be able to read them .PERIOD <BREAK>
if you ask the smartest physicists around who is the smartest physicist around ,COMMA in my experience half of them will say ed witten .PERIOD <BREAK>
so this is combining the federal level ,COMMA which is the largest ,COMMA the state level and the local level .PERIOD <BREAK>
you actually put action to the issues you care about .PERIOD <BREAK>
in fact ,COMMA i'm convinced i learned the narrative art from those nightly sessions with my father .PERIOD <BREAK>
and we finished our trip .PERIOD <BREAK>
we can change things ,COMMA but we have to actively change .PERIOD <BREAK>
is an apollo project of cooperation possible ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
i then proceeded to tell the patient ,COMMA once the patient was dressed ,COMMA the standard things that the person must have heard in other institutions ,COMMA which is ,COMMA this is not in your head .PERIOD <BREAK>
and they had a lot of different techniques that they would use for foraging ,COMMA but this particular one used vision .PERIOD <BREAK>
playful exploration ,COMMA playful building and role-play :COLON those are some of the ways that designers use play in their work .PERIOD <BREAK>
that was fortunate for me ,COMMA because in most press photos i appear too ,COMMA although often between sophia's legs .PERIOD <BREAK>
and that is how stethoscope and auscultation was born .PERIOD <BREAK>
so of course ,COMMA there are some biologists in the audience ,COMMA and i want to give some answers to some of the questions that you may have .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so at this point the computer is procedurally animating this creature .PERIOD <BREAK>
can you just encompass these people too ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
so now i'm like <NUM> yards from my arrival and i'm exhausted ,COMMA so my steps are slow .PERIOD <BREAK>
so we made them a big batch ,COMMA and it was in my -- now ,COMMA we'd just moved here .PERIOD we'd just moved to california .PERIOD <BREAK>
what goals is this ant trying to achieve by climbing this blade of grass ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
they're actually changing the way in which ideas are generated .PERIOD <BREAK>
three weeks later ,COMMA i received a complete set of drawings saying we'd won the competition .PERIOD <BREAK>
i mean ,COMMA this is a society that has learned -- and there are others too -- that has learned to live with a certain amount of terrorism and not be quite as upset by it ,COMMA shall i say ,COMMA as those of us who have not had many terror attacks .PERIOD <BREAK>
so a movement must be public .PERIOD <BREAK>
for me ,COMMA this kind of personifies this connected world ,COMMA where everything is intertwined ,COMMA and the dots are -- it's all about the dots joining together .PERIOD <BREAK>
now this is not very pleasant and comfortable .PERIOD <BREAK>
so i am a movement chauvinist .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA next time ,COMMA maybe ,COMMA i'll measure the speed of light !EXCLAMATIONMARK <BREAK>
at a macro level ,COMMA he thought ,COMMA you know ,COMMA we talk about democracy promotion ,COMMA but we do it in a way sometimes that's an affront to people's dignity .PERIOD <BREAK>
but all they had were big dinosaurs .PERIOD <BREAK>
to think about culture variation ,COMMA let's try a different metaphor .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is just one example .PERIOD <BREAK>
and ultimately -- and here's a picture of our bone marrow transplant survivors ,COMMA who come together for a reunion each year at stanford .PERIOD <BREAK>
i was curious about them and about the way in which they resolve conflict .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's called a carbon-oxygen dwarf .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's called rue des prairies -- prairie street .PERIOD <BREAK>
but ,COMMA this is really just the tip of the iceberg .PERIOD <BREAK>
well ,COMMA if that bag of chips then becomes inherently more expensive than an apple ,COMMA then maybe it's time for a different sense of personal responsibility in food choice because the choices are actually choices instead of three-quarters of the products being made just from corn ,COMMA soy and wheat .PERIOD <BREAK>
now for instance ,COMMA some of the wars that took place when i was in office ,COMMA a lot of them ,COMMA the women were the main victims of it .PERIOD <BREAK>
the three plants are areca palm ,COMMA mother-in-law's tongue and money plant .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is five dangerous things .PERIOD <BREAK>
anyway ,COMMA i went out to airstream about six times during the process of building this prototype ,COMMA and it's called the bambi prototype .PERIOD <BREAK>
and that thing's going to swing around and smash the snail .PERIOD <BREAK>
an unfortunate connection for us maybe ,COMMA but it reminds me that we'd like to thank one man for ,COMMA over the past decade ,COMMA working tirelessly to support comedians all around the world ,COMMA specifically comedians with a middle eastern background .PERIOD <BREAK>
they don't get any information ,COMMA they don't get any value for what they spend .PERIOD <BREAK>
so we're aware ,COMMA obviously ,COMMA of the relationship between insects and plants .PERIOD <BREAK>
biologists seem to think so .PERIOD <BREAK>
but anyway ,COMMA this is about the evils of science ,COMMA so i think it’s perfect .PERIOD <BREAK>
i mean ,COMMA because we ,COMMA at this point ,COMMA we can protect it .PERIOD <BREAK>
they knew no other way to live than to follow their dreams .PERIOD <BREAK>
okay ,COMMA this is skimming stones .PERIOD <BREAK>
this -- sorry -- -- that's a solar seed .PERIOD it's a concept for new architecture .PERIOD <BREAK>
a strong theme is always running through a well-told story .PERIOD <BREAK>
but i didn't actually do anything .PERIOD <BREAK>
governments don't naturally pick these things in the right way .PERIOD <BREAK>
in the vaccine area ,COMMA synthetic genomics and the institute are forming a new vaccine company because we think these tools can affect vaccines to diseases that haven't been possible to date ,COMMA things where the viruses rapidly evolve ,COMMA such with rhinovirus .PERIOD <BREAK>
there are more suicides in developed individualistic countries than in any other part of the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
really ,COMMA we have two separate concepts mapped onto the same word .PERIOD <BREAK>
so how can we perpetuate this pioneering spirit with something that will be independent from fossil energy ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and with that confidence surge ,COMMA i thought ,COMMA well ,COMMA it's time to create a real bakery ,COMMA so let's paint it .PERIOD and the women said ,COMMA that's a really great idea .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the blue former developing countries are mixing up with the former industrialized western world .PERIOD <BREAK>
we could use amino acids ,COMMA we could use nucleic acids ,COMMA carboxylic acids ,COMMA fatty acids .PERIOD <BREAK>
marissa ,COMMA she's all right ,COMMA she's one of your lot .PERIOD <BREAK>
this book is taking rather a long time ,COMMA but i'm nearly done .PERIOD <BREAK>
but we don't just do that either .PERIOD <BREAK>
now as you can imagine ,COMMA cutting open a leg bone is one thing ,COMMA but when you go to a museum and say ,COMMA you don't mind if i cut open your dinosaur's skull do you ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and that's what we did .PERIOD we went to haiti ,COMMA we went to rwanda ,COMMA afghanistan ,COMMA ethiopia ,COMMA mongolia .PERIOD <BREAK>
but i considered it a partial success ,COMMA to be honest .PERIOD <BREAK>
we have to stop that .PERIOD <BREAK>
so they broke that poll .PERIOD <BREAK>
and that's actually very perverse .PERIOD <BREAK>
they connect themselves into various sources ,COMMA into a kind of complex vector matrix that isn't really frontal but is really embedded in the lives ,COMMA and in the history of a city ,COMMA and of a people .PERIOD <BREAK>
but after that encounter i really did want to go back with that animal and dance .PERIOD <BREAK>
multiply <NUM> times <NUM> ,COMMA make sure you get <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> ,COMMA or the calculators are not working .PERIOD do all of you get <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> ?QUESTIONMARK <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
they were almost impossible to swallow .PERIOD <BREAK>
globalization is getting more complex .PERIOD <BREAK>
i mean ,COMMA if you did receive thousands of u .PERIOD s .PERIOD embassy diplomatic cables .PERIOD <BREAK>
we construct it and we construct those ideas .PERIOD <BREAK>
but they're doing what they're told ,COMMA and what they're being told to do is wrong .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA again ,COMMA this idea of workarounds .PERIOD <BREAK>
unicef came forward and said ,COMMA we'll buy most of the nets ,COMMA and then we'll give them away ,COMMA as part of the global fund's and the u .PERIOD n .PERIOD 's commitment to pregnant women and children ,COMMA for free .PERIOD <BREAK>
so after i had spent some years in the u .PERIOD s .PERIOD as an african ,COMMA i began to understand my roommate's response to me .PERIOD <BREAK>
can you imagine saying that ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
this is happening ,COMMA however ,COMMA against the background of the rise of web logging .PERIOD <BREAK>
now ,COMMA here's a piece of chalk .PERIOD <BREAK>
you can also see that there's a lot of short sequence motifs that repeat over and over and over again ,COMMA so for example there's a lot of what we call polyalanines ,COMMA or iterated a's ,COMMA aaaaa .PERIOD there's ggq .PERIOD there's ggy .PERIOD <BREAK>
and whether it's jewish or whether it's muslim or whether it's hindu ,COMMA or whether it's sikh ,COMMA the same global ethic is at the heart of each of these religions .PERIOD <BREAK>
well ,COMMA because then it tells me the truth ,COMMA instead of me imposing the truth .PERIOD <BREAK>
what does it look like ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
woman <NUM> :COLON they suck ?QUESTIONMARK what about yours ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
saidulluh sahib is in motihari ,COMMA again in champaran .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's truly stunning that these organisms can do that ,COMMA and we probably have thousands ,COMMA if not tens of thousands ,COMMA of different species on this planet that are capable of doing that .PERIOD <BREAK>
and then ,COMMA of course ,COMMA you have to do something about how to moderate that ,COMMA so that anybody can -- so they'll listen to you .PERIOD <BREAK>
and lastly ,COMMA to the slightly obscure world of entropy -- the second law of thermodynamics .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA we are in the business of finding our happiness .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i thought ,COMMA well ,COMMA that's got a pretentious name ,COMMA especially since the whole system ran on his computer in his office .PERIOD <BREAK>
and how much does it cost ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
blindness ,COMMA polio -- early detection ,COMMA early response .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the point of this magazine was to read the articles ,COMMA listen to the music ,COMMA and try to interpret it .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA a new vocabulary of form is now pervading all design fields :COLON whether it's automobiles ,COMMA architecture ,COMMA products ,COMMA etc .PERIOD it's really being affected by this digital medium of curvature .PERIOD <BREAK>
i've got two kids .PERIOD he's <NUM> now ;SEMICOLON my daughter's <NUM> .PERIOD <BREAK>
fatah party member :COLON we must empty our minds of traditional thinking .PERIOD <BREAK>
but i can assure you that this woman in the favela in rio ,COMMA she wants a washing machine .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is our landscape of food .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i call it hometown security .PERIOD <BREAK>
i don't get it .PERIOD <BREAK>
a typical example being ,COMMA sometimes it is necessary to tell lies .PERIOD <BREAK>
a lot of you have gotten that phillips direct life .PERIOD <BREAK>
we buy stuff we didn't know we needed .PERIOD <BREAK>
the concept centers on something called the noor stones .PERIOD <BREAK>
and we're discovering ,COMMA with our research ,COMMA that's often very local to the node you care about within one or two degrees .PERIOD <BREAK>
it took much longer than sometimes we like to think in this story ,COMMA but by <NUM> ,COMMA when the next big cholera outbreak came to london ,COMMA the authorities had been convinced -- in part because of this story ,COMMA in part because of this map -- that in fact the water was the problem .PERIOD <BREAK>
evolution works that way .PERIOD <BREAK>
why did it fail ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
so ,COMMA you know ,COMMA this does happen .PERIOD <BREAK>
try to imagine a world where the only goal is food and a shelter ,COMMA but no stories .PERIOD <BREAK>
so i'm not that unhappy about that .PERIOD <BREAK>
and this dispels a myth too ,COMMA this false choice between the environment and the economy .PERIOD <BREAK>
now the effect of perseveration is to basically take these first three components of regret and put them on an infinite loop .PERIOD <BREAK>
my parents got divorced ,COMMA and my sister was arrested .PERIOD <BREAK>
so everyone of you turns to their neighbor please .PERIOD <BREAK>
and no two people could disagree about what the word free was and what the word falafel was ,COMMA behind us ,COMMA free falafel .PERIOD you know .PERIOD <BREAK>
they were key in our culture and our economy .PERIOD <BREAK>
this isn't my first time here .PERIOD this isn't my last time here .PERIOD <BREAK>
all right .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it's all solid steel -- you can hear here .PERIOD <BREAK>
and here's the guide for the perplexed by maimonides .PERIOD <BREAK>
just <NUM> years ago ,COMMA both the u .PERIOD s .PERIOD and france were saying they were investing militarily in cyberspace ,COMMA strictly to defend their it systems .PERIOD <BREAK>
the more we keep on using the oil ,COMMA particularly the imported oil ,COMMA the more we face a very obvious array of problems .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA i got working .PERIOD i took some sheets of paper and started practicing ,COMMA practicing ,COMMA practicing ,COMMA until i reached what i thought was a steady hand ,COMMA and went into action .PERIOD <BREAK>
usually i'm wearing a helmet .PERIOD in the mountains i'm always wearing a helmet because of landings -- usually it's difficult -- it's not like regular skydiving where you have like the big landings .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i don't know if there's a stronger kind of effect than pattern and the way it unites kind of disparate elements .PERIOD <BREAK>
so i think that ,COMMA as a symbol ,COMMA it's important .PERIOD <BREAK>
because some cycle ,COMMA there is a spot in the cycle ,COMMA and you have not the same duty in the different parts of the cycle .PERIOD <BREAK>
but you might ask ,COMMA well so what in any case ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
what does that mean ?QUESTIONMARK imagine this .PERIOD <BREAK>
you can imagine what something like this might look like five ,COMMA <NUM> or <NUM> years from now as our technical capabilities improve .PERIOD <BREAK>
i was playing the violent african ,COMMA the african terrorist .PERIOD <BREAK>
we got <NUM> of the world's best economists ,COMMA three in each area .PERIOD <BREAK>
our robot belongs to a family of robots called ballbots .PERIOD <BREAK>
we tend to form clusters based on similarity ,COMMA and then we produce stereotypes about other clusters of people .PERIOD <BREAK>
thirdly ,COMMA variation in tempo .PERIOD <BREAK>
my mind was so shattered .PERIOD <BREAK>
they go in with their own friction .PERIOD <BREAK>
put yourself in the position of the kidnapper wanting to bribe the officer .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is a million people gathering on the banks of the ganges in <NUM> ,COMMA perhaps the largest single gathering of human beings ever ,COMMA as seen from satellite photograph .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's like resetting a thermostat .PERIOD <BREAK>
well if you look at the macro level ,COMMA it seems more money ,COMMA more hiv .PERIOD <BREAK>
well ,COMMA you have two things .PERIOD <BREAK>
you get a new disease that can be deadly .PERIOD <BREAK>
i did not watch the skies ,COMMA but the very end of the street where the buses and cars and pedestrians and little scooters were moving along .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i don't understand it ,COMMA and i never will .PERIOD <BREAK>
one of the things which my intern here ,COMMA pratesh ,COMMA built is a mobile application ,COMMA which can now send all this data anywhere it wants to go .PERIOD <BREAK>
so this is how this scheme would look .PERIOD <BREAK>
and then i took an inventory of the characteristics ,COMMA along with her ,COMMA of the of the capabilities and elements of different dancers who'd won championships .PERIOD <BREAK>
and when you kill the sex drive ,COMMA you kill orgasm .PERIOD <BREAK>
i've got a girlfriend who's just getting over a terrible love affair .PERIOD <BREAK>
i thought ,COMMA ian ,COMMA stay out of it ,COMMA stay out of it ,COMMA you know ,COMMA walk on .PERIOD <BREAK>
yeah .PERIOD so the first thing we had to do was find a way to get this -- we had to work with the families of the victims ,COMMA through the city ,COMMA to make sure that they knew this was happening .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA show the original picture for <NUM> milliseconds .PERIOD blank .PERIOD <BREAK>
now the question is ,COMMA what targets in the brain can we find that allow us to overcome this fear ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and equally ,COMMA when it comes to climate change ,COMMA every single country is going to have to make cuts .PERIOD <BREAK>
and how much punishment would i get if i get caught ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
imagine making all of our hard materials that way .PERIOD <BREAK>
in <NUM> this country went through a great depression ,COMMA which led to all the ideas of the state and social security ,COMMA and all the other things that happened in roosevelt's time .PERIOD <BREAK>
so it's exciting potential for this .PERIOD <BREAK>
so it's ,COMMA for me ,COMMA a great product .PERIOD <BREAK>
i would keep your eye on this fellow .PERIOD <BREAK>
what happens is that bacteria are able to count how many of me and how many of you .PERIOD <BREAK>
what i'm going to try and do now is to square ,COMMA in my head ,COMMA four two-digit numbers faster than they can do on their calculators ,COMMA even using the shortcut method .PERIOD <BREAK>
this made it unprofitable for some farmers to even harvest the grain from the fields .PERIOD <BREAK>
so in short ,COMMA i'm startled by all the things that they don't have .PERIOD <BREAK>
stay here .PERIOD i've got a question .PERIOD <BREAK>
and to think that the tumor was in the same bone ,COMMA in the same place in my body as the accident <NUM> years earlier -- it seemed like too much of a coincidence .PERIOD <BREAK>
now fast forward to <NUM> :COLON half the world's people -- more than half -- still live in asia ,COMMA but they're now making only a fifth of the world's product .PERIOD <BREAK>
an australian study in <NUM> found that olive oil in combination with fruits ,COMMA vegetables and pulses offers measurable protection against skin wrinklings .PERIOD <BREAK>

in canada ,COMMA five boys drop out for every three girls .PERIOD <BREAK>
finally ,COMMA mussa-ivaldi of northwestern took a completely intact ,COMMA independent lamprey eel brain .PERIOD <BREAK>
the billboards say lab space available .PERIOD <BREAK>
you also have three microprocessors .PERIOD <BREAK>
mostly they're worried about each other .PERIOD <BREAK>
when i asked her if she feared anything ,COMMA or whether she would miss anything from mathare ,COMMA she said ,COMMA what would i fear that i haven't confronted already ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
this may actually be heresy to say this at ted ,COMMA but i'd like to introduce you to the most important innovation ,COMMA i think ,COMMA in medicine to come in the next <NUM> years ,COMMA and that is the power of the human hand -- to touch ,COMMA to comfort ,COMMA to diagnose and to bring about treatment .PERIOD <BREAK>
those factories will probably never see an inspector .PERIOD <BREAK>
i don't remember the rape part of it so much as much as the anger part of it .PERIOD <BREAK>
tom reilly :COLON exactly .PERIOD <BREAK>
they could sell these things for anything between $ <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> a kilo .PERIOD <BREAK>
here's clive sinclair now launching his color computer .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA like ,COMMA ok ,COMMA maybe it had to do with the patterns on the little pieces of paper -- you know ,COMMA like ,COMMA it was a diamond ,COMMA or ,COMMA you know ,COMMA diagonal .PERIOD <BREAK>
right ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
of course ,COMMA that official is now dead ,COMMA and i'm not ,COMMA so there's a certain amount of glory in outliving your adversaries .PERIOD <BREAK>
yes ,COMMA we slaughter ,COMMA you know .PERIOD yes ,COMMA that's life .PERIOD <BREAK>
the poem is called libation ,COMMA and it's for my friend vusi who is in the audience here somewhere .PERIOD <BREAK>
right now ,COMMA <NUM> percent of these nets are being bought by the u .PERIOD n .PERIOD and then given primarily to people around africa .PERIOD <BREAK>
but deeply tucked into the fabric of space itself ,COMMA the idea is there could be more dimensions ,COMMA as we see there .PERIOD <BREAK>
take a square one there ,COMMA first .PERIOD <BREAK>
this control of muscle is very ,COMMA very important ,COMMA because ,COMMA you know ,COMMA there can be reflexes .PERIOD <BREAK>
let's look .PERIOD you don't have to know what these things mean ,COMMA doesn't make any difference .PERIOD <BREAK>
they don't seem to suffer from the same fear of heights that humans do .PERIOD <BREAK>
it senses it by chemical means and very importantly by mechanical means ,COMMA because it has to move the food -- it has to mix all the various elements which we need for digestion .PERIOD <BREAK>
you must fight anyone who encroaches upon it .PERIOD <BREAK>
eighty thousand people spread over the entire valley .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i will start with a brief taster of what i’ve been about :COLON a handful of films -- nothing much ,COMMA two feature films and a handful of short films .PERIOD <BREAK>
or are there more systematic factors at work ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
if you look at the origins of this ,COMMA the classic history sort of takes it all back to the eniac here .PERIOD <BREAK>
and that's the message i try to convey to them .PERIOD <BREAK>
text :COLON you can say a jury is corrupt .PERIOD <BREAK>
because architecture is also the asking of questions .PERIOD <BREAK>
as a kid ,COMMA i watched a lot of television and had lots of nerdy hobbies like mineralogy and microbiology and the space program and a little bit of politics .PERIOD <BREAK>
so i studied her mammogram ,COMMA and i reviewed the radiology literature ,COMMA and i was shocked to discover that ,COMMA in her case ,COMMA our chances of finding a tumor early on the mammogram were less than the toss of a coin .PERIOD <BREAK>
supposedly ,COMMA science is stating that it could be the oldest living animal on earth right now .PERIOD <BREAK>
i think that generally an 'agnostic' would be the most correct description of my state of mind .PERIOD <BREAK>
at one hand ,COMMA we all want to look at ourselves in the mirror and feel good about ourselves ,COMMA so we don't want to cheat .PERIOD <BREAK>
i have the wrist rotation that goes -- and it can go all the way around .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so one of the tools that we can use to sample the oceans is acoustics ,COMMA or sound waves .PERIOD <BREAK>
power .PERIOD <BREAK>
and ,COMMA as you can see ,COMMA the death rate goes down from <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> deaths per conflict per year in the <NUM> s to less than <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> deaths per conflict per year in this decade ,COMMA as horrific as it is .PERIOD <BREAK>
and by the way ,COMMA chris ,COMMA that would've been a really good panel ,COMMA i think ,COMMA right there .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the other thing that one should take away from this chart is the very narrow range of time over which humans can claim to be the dominant intelligence on the planet .PERIOD <BREAK>
but the demagogues are right about one thing :COLON we need a universal conception of human values .PERIOD <BREAK>
now ,COMMA what has happened ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>

and what i discovered is this parallel reality ,COMMA another international economic system ,COMMA which runs parallel to our own ,COMMA which has been created by arms organizations since the end of world war ii .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's an opportunity to truly build a world where we can extend services and products to all human beings ,COMMA so that they can make decisions and choices for themselves .PERIOD <BREAK>
thank you .PERIOD <BREAK>
we have to reform our economies ,COMMA change our leadership ,COMMA become more democratic ,COMMA be more open to change and to information .PERIOD <BREAK>
these are just different cartoons .PERIOD <BREAK>
we can position them in different places ,COMMA orient them in different places .PERIOD <BREAK>
it wasn't a baseball player ;SEMICOLON it was linus pauling .PERIOD <BREAK>

this building has the ability ,COMMA in short order ,COMMA to go back to a flat floor organization such that they can rent it out .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's not the way they occur in the film ,COMMA because they are part of much larger scenes .PERIOD <BREAK>
so these are simple ideas ,COMMA but we didn't know .PERIOD <BREAK>
for one thing ,COMMA germany had surpassed britain in industrial strength by <NUM> .PERIOD <BREAK>
they're the ones that are embedded in that sea of dark matter that are causing the bending of the light to cause these optical illusions ,COMMA or mirages ,COMMA practically ,COMMA of the background galaxies .PERIOD <BREAK>
later on ,COMMA in france ,COMMA i loved eavesdropping on grownups' conversations ,COMMA and i would hear all sorts of stories about my father's previous life ,COMMA especially that he had done world war ii ,COMMA that he had done the algerian war .PERIOD <BREAK>
i don't believe in the hope of change ,COMMA unless we take action to make it so .PERIOD <BREAK>
if you did ,COMMA it would be because people had carved them .PERIOD <BREAK>
there is nothing on the other side .PERIOD <BREAK>
these people go to bed hungry .PERIOD <BREAK>
you know ,COMMA that's not good enough .PERIOD <BREAK>
and they would just stare at us with bafflement when we spend time listening to a beautiful performance ,COMMA like the one we just heard -- because of people making stupid movements ,COMMA and they would be really irritated and wouldn't see what we were up to .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is a dna synthesizer ,COMMA and here at the bottom are just bottles of a ,COMMA t ,COMMA c and g -- the four chemicals that make up our dna chain .PERIOD <BREAK>
it goes like this :COLON <NUM> people across four separate tests -- everyone wrote down their personal goal .PERIOD <BREAK>
you know ,COMMA it can be used as an incredible means of transmitting power .PERIOD <BREAK>
so micropayments have become huge .PERIOD <BREAK>
suddenly ,COMMA we're almost longing for him to return .PERIOD <BREAK>

they work against the clock and against the thermometer .PERIOD <BREAK>

no ,COMMA no ,COMMA no !EXCLAMATIONMARK it should be the incredibles .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA this is the fun part .PERIOD <BREAK>

and i think the real challenge is to figure out where are the cases in our lives where conflicts of interest work on us ,COMMA and try not to trust our own intuition to overcome it ,COMMA but to try to do things that prevent us from falling prey to these behaviors ,COMMA because we can create lots of undesirable circumstances .PERIOD <BREAK>
we need helium ,COMMA and the helium is what we really need to go deep .PERIOD <BREAK>
so universal access to all knowledge -- i think it can be one of the greatest achievements of humankind ,COMMA like the man on the moon ,COMMA or the gutenberg bible ,COMMA or the library of alexandria .PERIOD <BREAK>

and that's why we're last ,COMMA because we don't value play .PERIOD <BREAK>
so we recognize that studio h ,COMMA especially in its first year ,COMMA is a small story -- <NUM> students ,COMMA it's two teachers ,COMMA it's one project in one place .PERIOD <BREAK>

billions of events have occurred in your history that are related in time to yourself as the receiver ,COMMA or yourself as the actor ,COMMA yourself as the thinker ,COMMA yourself as the mover .PERIOD <BREAK>

and i will give you several examples .PERIOD <BREAK>
she regrew her own trachea ,COMMA and <NUM> hours later it was implanted .PERIOD <BREAK>
so this is something you have to recognize .PERIOD <BREAK>
so makers harvest technology from all the places around us .PERIOD <BREAK>
if we don't supply vitamins to the prisoners ,COMMA it's a war crime .PERIOD <BREAK>

and my laptop runs slower ,COMMA less reliably and less pleasantly than it ever has before .PERIOD <BREAK>
but at the bottom left ,COMMA you see electrolux ,COMMA which is on sale .PERIOD <BREAK>
if we extrapolate back ,COMMA we find we must have all been on top of each other about <NUM> billion years ago .PERIOD <BREAK>

five factorial is <NUM> .PERIOD <BREAK>
that's the kind of dedication these people have .PERIOD <BREAK>

this bench ,COMMA although it was uncomfortable for my mom -- she didn't like sitting on it ,COMMA so she went and bought these cushions for me from a local jumble sale -- reusing ,COMMA a job that was pretty good .PERIOD <BREAK>

one is the focused ultrasound ,COMMA and the other one is the vision-enabled magnetic resonance imaging .PERIOD <BREAK>
i think it's the only precedent in which money has ever been stopped from being used .PERIOD <BREAK>
and this makes many things fun ,COMMA but it makes it difficult to actually get any kind of picture on the world we live in or on ourselves .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so what that means is the kind of things that we used to only talk about at science fiction conventions like comic-con have to be talked about in the halls of power and places like the pentagon .PERIOD <BREAK>
so i've joined a growing band of people that try to make molecular spells using dna .PERIOD we use dna because it's cheaper .PERIOD <BREAK>

i was beaten by my husband for five years .PERIOD <BREAK>
here's another robot ,COMMA the packbot ,COMMA that we've been building for a bunch of years .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA these leaves at the edge would start to disappear .PERIOD <BREAK>

the geopolitical world has got a lot to learn from the digital world .PERIOD <BREAK>

they can locomote on substrates that vary as you saw -- in the probability of contact ,COMMA the movement of that surface and the type of footholds that are present .PERIOD <BREAK>

you do .PERIOD it's your emotional brain .PERIOD <BREAK>
we use out-of-date systems that are unfair and create random results .PERIOD <BREAK>

the prime minister is <NUM> years old .PERIOD <BREAK>

so that these don't just exist as one entity ,COMMA we kind of chemically engineer them .PERIOD <BREAK>
using those intellectual filters ,COMMA we eliminated [ <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> .PERIOD ] we were left with <NUM> chemicals .PERIOD <BREAK>
because this good will is unconsciously picked up by other people ,COMMA and it creates trust ,COMMA and trust creates a lot of good working relationships .PERIOD <BREAK>
can you see the poorest billion ,COMMA those [two] boxes i had over here ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and they were excluded from decision-making ,COMMA and now they are in the forefront of the news ,COMMA raising the flag .PERIOD <BREAK>

even in subjects like math and creative writing ,COMMA which you think would depend on solo flights of thought ,COMMA kids are now expected to act as committee members .PERIOD <BREAK>
you build platforms for self-expression and collaboration .PERIOD <BREAK>
and there's the terrible and dreaded observer effect ,COMMA in which you're looking for something ,COMMA and you know ,COMMA things are happening simultaneously ,COMMA and you're looking at it in a different way ,COMMA and you're trying to really look for the about-ness ,COMMA or what is this story about .PERIOD and if you try too hard ,COMMA then you will only write the about .PERIOD <BREAK>

a human judge has a conversation with a human and a computer .PERIOD <BREAK>

what i take away ,COMMA and this in some ways is the most important ,COMMA he espoused and exhibited a reverence for dignity that was really ,COMMA really unusual .PERIOD <BREAK>

six thousand people killed there in the last <NUM> months as a direct consequence of the cocaine trade .PERIOD <BREAK>

here's a clue .PERIOD <BREAK>
okay .PERIOD anyway .PERIOD <BREAK>
america is an empire .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's about the relationship between the city and the countryside .PERIOD <BREAK>
because the sloth bears in the wild were obviously getting depleted because of this .PERIOD <BREAK>
and playboy is always in the top few .PERIOD <BREAK>
the message ,COMMA the final message ,COMMA is this :COLON india gave a great gift to the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
that's malcolm x and the suffragists and gay pride parades .PERIOD <BREAK>
i do a radio show .PERIOD <BREAK>
so really what i'm doing is using these fantastic little devices .PERIOD <BREAK>
the sense in which i can be uplifting and inspiring -- i mean ,COMMA there's always been a kind of a certain grim dimension to the way i try to uplift ,COMMA so if grim inspiration -- -- if grim inspiration is not a contradiction in terms ,COMMA that is ,COMMA i'm afraid ,COMMA the most you can hope for .PERIOD ok ,COMMA today -- that's if i succeed .PERIOD <BREAK>

you throw everything else away .PERIOD you become a monomaniac -- all you care about is not stepping out on that platform .PERIOD <BREAK>

so ,COMMA maybe what is happening is that there's a level of cheating we can't go over ,COMMA but we can still benefit from cheating at a low degree ,COMMA as long as it doesn't change our impressions about ourselves .PERIOD <BREAK>
what is happening is that ,COMMA very rapidly in historical terms ,COMMA the world is being driven and shaped ,COMMA not by the old developed countries ,COMMA but by the developing world .PERIOD <BREAK>
the european union is now spending over one billion euros annually translating among their <NUM> official languages .PERIOD <BREAK>

you have to know where your energy is coming from .PERIOD <BREAK>
anyone who tells you that we understand life ,COMMA walk away .PERIOD <BREAK>

with a proper body position i'm able to really move forward to gain quite some distance .PERIOD <BREAK>
because we believe that it's not biology ;SEMICOLON it's culture .PERIOD <BREAK>
this would be an example of how to do that .PERIOD <BREAK>
finally ,COMMA as a scientist and as a person and now ,COMMA as part of the ted community ,COMMA i feel that i have better tools to go out to trees ,COMMA to go out to forests ,COMMA to go out to nature ,COMMA to make new discoveries about nature -- and about humans' place in nature wherever we are and whomever you are .PERIOD <BREAK>

and the most remarkable feat is that my hand actually stayed still long enough to do that .PERIOD <BREAK>

most of the cooperative systems we've seen haven't been around long enough to have gotten to the acceptance phase .PERIOD <BREAK>

and so we met dr .PERIOD sono khangharani in pakistan .PERIOD <BREAK>
campthree is at the base of lhotse ,COMMA which is the fourth highest mountain in the world ,COMMA but it's dwarfed by everest .PERIOD <BREAK>
they're doing it because they are expecting things to happen .PERIOD <BREAK>

i mean ,COMMA for instance ,COMMA i've had to -- you know ,COMMA i've been running the largest group of private companies in europe ,COMMA but haven't been able to know the difference between net and gross .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i was floored ,COMMA and i was broken ,COMMA and i was angry .PERIOD <BREAK>
you know ,COMMA you see ,COMMA you've got to question the official truth .PERIOD <BREAK>
we need to be able to imagine going back and making a different choice ,COMMA and then we need to be able to kind of spool this imaginary record forward and imagine how things would be playing out in our present .PERIOD <BREAK>
and he thought ,COMMA what if we do this ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
after going to sleep at <NUM> :COLON <NUM> a .PERIOD m .PERIOD <BREAK>
now you can say that intelligent design designs our airplanes of today ,COMMA but there was no intelligent design really designing those early airplanes .PERIOD <BREAK>
we can reform our electoral systems .PERIOD <BREAK>
you get two or three discrete locations .PERIOD <BREAK>
and we think in a gene-centric view -- maybe going back to richard dawkins' ideas -- than in a genome-centric view ,COMMA which are different constructs of these gene components .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i said ,COMMA why don't you use that ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
they were yelling at him ,COMMA they were -- it got to be really ugly .PERIOD <BREAK>
i ,COMMA like most of you ,COMMA was sitting down ,COMMA the day after christmas in <NUM> ,COMMA when i was watching the devastating news of the asian tsunami as it rolled in ,COMMA playing out on tv .PERIOD <BREAK>
so i said ,COMMA now it's okay .PERIOD the room is too small .PERIOD <BREAK>
that was like just so super cool .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it weights those together into an attention window ,COMMA and it looks for the highest-scoring place -- the stuff where the most interesting stuff is happening -- and that is what its eyes then segue to .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is a call center .PERIOD notice how it's decorated .PERIOD <BREAK>
we've got a new one this year ,COMMA but we'll work on that next season .PERIOD <BREAK>
but -- and it's a big but -- it turns out ,COMMA when you look at the methods used by industry-funded trials ,COMMA that they're actually better than independently sponsored trials .PERIOD <BREAK>
it has no nails or screws .PERIOD <BREAK>
and from that stick figure ,COMMA i somehow have to get to a folded shape that has a part for every bit of the subject ,COMMA a flap for every leg .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so ,COMMA what i've done is ,COMMA i started getting interested in creating online social spaces to share that feeling with people who don't consider themselves artists .PERIOD <BREAK>
i'm going to argue today that the social media applications that we all know and love ,COMMA or love to hate ,COMMA are actually going to help free us from some of the absurd assumptions that we have as a society about gender .PERIOD <BREAK>
you know ,COMMA <NUM> years ago ,COMMA or <NUM> years ago ,COMMA really ,COMMA you walk into an astronomy convention ,COMMA and you say ,COMMA you know ,COMMA there's probably a black hole at the center of every galaxy ,COMMA and they're going to hoot you off the stage .PERIOD <BREAK>
a simple idea ,COMMA but it could have such far-reaching consequences .PERIOD <BREAK>
let me show you some of them :COLON chichen itza ,COMMA rapa nui -- and what you're seeing here are the cloud of points -- babylon ,COMMA rosslyn chapel ,COMMA pompeii ,COMMA and our latest project ,COMMA mt .PERIOD rushmore ,COMMA which happened to be one of our most challenging projects .PERIOD <BREAK>
the question i would ask is ,COMMA what's worth solving ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
i wasn't raised with wealth or resources or any social standing to speak of .PERIOD <BREAK>
now let's link them ,COMMA and it's beginning to happen ,COMMA isn't it ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
he was in the u .PERIOD n .PERIOD for <NUM> years .PERIOD he joined at the age of <NUM> .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it carried <NUM> people at the speed of a buick at an altitude you could hear dogs bark ,COMMA and it cost twice as much as a first-class cabin on the normandie to fly it .PERIOD <BREAK>
but viennese audiences do not do that .PERIOD <BREAK>
it was a space where people would get together from different backgrounds ,COMMA different fields of expertise ,COMMA and share .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA this is normal dna ,COMMA what you think of as normal dna .PERIOD <BREAK>
and this is -- you can see -- this is a flapping bird .PERIOD <BREAK>
but we have to remember ,COMMA these are just the clips .PERIOD <BREAK>
immediate detection ,COMMA immediate response .PERIOD <BREAK>
they'll have loving families and welcoming homes ,COMMA but they may not have me .PERIOD <BREAK>
you see ,COMMA the gods have to come back again and again and again as ram ,COMMA as krishna .PERIOD <BREAK>
and he designed this system ,COMMA but it really didn't work ,COMMA because his viruses were constantly destroying each other .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the second boy said ,COMMA i bring you myrhh .PERIOD <BREAK>
ken olsen famously said ,COMMA nobody needs a computer in the home .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's like a happiness adjusted life-expectancy .PERIOD <BREAK>
over the last six-and-a-half years ,COMMA we've been working really hard at rice university on a project called connexions ,COMMA and so what i'd like to do for the rest of the talk is just tell you a little bit about what people are doing with connexions ,COMMA which you can kind of think of as the counterpoint to nicholas negroponte's talk yesterday ,COMMA where they're working on the hardware of bringing education to the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
and with every click of the mouse and every touch of the screen ,COMMA we are like hansel and gretel leaving breadcrumbs of our personal information everywhere we travel through the digital woods .PERIOD <BREAK>
we'll make a new film about this process .PERIOD <BREAK>
so half the time ,COMMA she acted as if she liked the crackers and didn't like the broccoli -- just like a baby and any other sane person .PERIOD <BREAK>
and he demanded that the jews supply enough for everyone .PERIOD <BREAK>
another time ,COMMA she watched in horror as nurses watched a patient die because they refused to give her oxygen that they had .PERIOD <BREAK>
and there are a lot of things that contribute to that .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's two and a half inches thick ,COMMA and supported at two points .PERIOD <BREAK>
what we have here is a list of old viruses .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA you can play a video game ,COMMA drive through a piece of music ,COMMA use your body gesture to control huge masses of sound ,COMMA touch a special surface to make melodies ,COMMA use your voice to make a whole aura .PERIOD <BREAK>
let me be clear .PERIOD <BREAK>
you won't discover anything .PERIOD <BREAK>
and in my view ,COMMA there is simply no place in the world that has grown its agriculture on the kind of risk that our farmers in africa today face .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so i urge all of you to think next time as to how to engage with this notion and this opportunity that we all have -- to make poverty history -- by really becoming part of the process and moving away from an us-and-them world ,COMMA and realizing that it's about all of us ,COMMA and the kind of world that we ,COMMA together ,COMMA want to live in and share .PERIOD <BREAK>
i'm excited when i glimpse that kind of thinking writ large .PERIOD <BREAK>
and theirs is the kind of influence that can finally unblock the situation .PERIOD <BREAK>
philosophers know this game very well .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i think the key to that is self-assembly .PERIOD <BREAK>
the students don't usually leave the computer lab till <NUM> or <NUM> a .PERIOD m .PERIOD <BREAK>
we need to spend more time appreciating what already exists ,COMMA and less time agonizing over what else we can do .PERIOD <BREAK>
i was also making a tv series for the bbc at the time .PERIOD <BREAK>
there will always be another frontier .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the first gene that was mapped in association studies for this ,COMMA early-onset prostate cancer ,COMMA was this gene called rnasel .PERIOD <BREAK>
take the analytical frameworks ,COMMA the capabilities you have ,COMMA apply them to old fears .PERIOD <BREAK>
and my wish ,COMMA when i see those women ,COMMA i meet those farmers ,COMMA and i think about all the people across this continent who are working hard every day ,COMMA is that they have that sense of opportunity and possibility ,COMMA and that they also can believe and get access to services ,COMMA so that their children ,COMMA too ,COMMA can live those lives of great purpose .PERIOD <BREAK>
so after we had declan ,COMMA we kind of recalibrated our expectations .PERIOD <BREAK>
people died ;SEMICOLON so be it .PERIOD <BREAK>
this smells of cut grass .PERIOD now ,COMMA this is the skeleton of the molecule .PERIOD <BREAK>
now ,COMMA many of the people who participate in earth witness would focus on ecological problems ,COMMA human-caused or otherwise ,COMMA especially environmental crimes and significant sources of greenhouse gases and emissions .PERIOD <BREAK>
yeah .PERIOD <BREAK>
i want to show you -- i'm also like a big -- i go to astrologers and tarot card readers often ,COMMA and that's another thing that motivates me a lot .PERIOD <BREAK>
he groomed us ,COMMA the three of us ,COMMA to hate the thought of having a job and to love the fact of creating companies that we could employ other people .PERIOD <BREAK>
so of course ,COMMA when you educate a girl ,COMMA she tends to get married later on in life ,COMMA she tends to have kids later on in life ,COMMA she tends to have fewer kids ,COMMA and those kids that she does have ,COMMA she educates them in a more enlightened fashion .PERIOD <BREAK>
and we released the film at the same time that the congress was debating the renewal of the violence against women act .PERIOD <BREAK>
in this example here ,COMMA we had monitored this reef in galapagos with temperature recorders ,COMMA so we know the temperature of the water the coral's growing in .PERIOD <BREAK>
so this is capturing the trace of a thumbprint because ,COMMA knowingly or unknowingly ,COMMA whatever we do ,COMMA you know ,COMMA we leave our traces here .PERIOD <BREAK>
her blood pressure was an alarming <NUM> over <NUM> .PERIOD <BREAK>
he said ,COMMA no .PERIOD half the cabinet went to see the grandmothers the next day .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the rate at which the arctic sea ice is going away is a lot quicker than models .PERIOD <BREAK>
but it's remote .PERIOD it's remote and accessible so it's safe and we don't depend on mechanical refrigeration .PERIOD <BREAK>
now we have sprawling residential suburbias that are well distinct from production areas and commercial areas .PERIOD <BREAK>
good morning .PERIOD my name is david rose .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so they're holding off until they get a deal with them .PERIOD <BREAK>
just as wings open up this sphere of air for birds to exploit ,COMMA language opened up the sphere of cooperation for humans to exploit .PERIOD <BREAK>
lady :COLON will you glide with us ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>

do poor have legs ,COMMA mouth and hands ,COMMA but no head ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and so this is very exciting news .PERIOD <BREAK>
we are a soul .PERIOD <BREAK>
even the hardcore in the green movement use washing machines .PERIOD <BREAK>
he slept over at my house once ,COMMA and he left his pillow .PERIOD <BREAK>
that's how to create a digital human in <NUM> minutes .PERIOD <BREAK>
perhaps some circular pieces of metal .PERIOD <BREAK>
most of them should be in orbit around something .PERIOD <BREAK>
so that's the flickr photo ,COMMA that's our imagery .PERIOD <BREAK>
it has also given us this ,COMMA the ability to look at the world from the outside .PERIOD <BREAK>
and you say ,COMMA i'm sorry ,COMMA well ,COMMA this is oak street ,COMMA that's elm street .PERIOD <BREAK>
of these ,COMMA two-thirds ,COMMA <NUM> million are living in sub-saharan africa .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the last material i'm going to talk about today is plastic ,COMMA and ,COMMA of course ,COMMA my toaster had to have a plastic case .PERIOD <BREAK>
i'm noticing that it's happening all over the country ,COMMA and the good news is that it's growing .PERIOD <BREAK>
one year later ,COMMA how she is .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's a phenomenal thing .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so we came up with the bright idea that instead of getting people to walk <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> kilometers to see doctors ,COMMA you get the doctors to the people .PERIOD <BREAK>
thank you very much .PERIOD <BREAK>
and they all seemed to be ok .PERIOD <BREAK>
how many cattle are mooing their heads off ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
so what does it mean about defining life ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and these are studies commissioned by the zionist organization for alternative areas for jewish settlement .PERIOD <BREAK>

they listen and mimic and remix what they like .PERIOD <BREAK>
this man is significant for a whole host of reasons .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is how it works ,COMMA and really ,COMMA this is a generic technology .PERIOD <BREAK>
so lets all wish for his great health ,COMMA and his awareness of his own skin pigmentation .PERIOD <BREAK>
now ,COMMA to try and explain this in sort of real terms ,COMMA i want to talk about a kind of task that might fall to you in so many games .PERIOD <BREAK>
this was a period in my life where i was traveling <NUM> days per year .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's something we're bad at doing .PERIOD <BREAK>
and that's what we've got to keep growing .PERIOD <BREAK>
well ,COMMA how are we going to think about this ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
when you go to places like this what you see is that education in these settings works by pull ,COMMA not push .PERIOD <BREAK>
you had a monopoly supplier .PERIOD on the left ,COMMA you have rupert murdoch ,COMMA or the bbc .PERIOD <BREAK>
vaccines that are broad spectrum .PERIOD <BREAK>
but the small stuff ,COMMA what you might call the user interface ,COMMA is done spectacularly badly .PERIOD <BREAK>
i've been amazed in the last year at the incredible quality and excitement of the innovations that have come across my desk .PERIOD <BREAK>
number five of the seven is the payoff .PERIOD this is it .PERIOD the climax .PERIOD <BREAK>
we develop more emotional maturity if we play more .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA for all of you who saw that ,COMMA you're a complete realist .PERIOD all right ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
but sometimes when his female patients can't afford his services ,COMMA their families give the women to jura in exchange for medical treatment .PERIOD <BREAK>
and you barely might be able to make out this hut here .PERIOD <BREAK>
yet still ,COMMA many of us believe that we should make all our own choices and seek out even more of them .PERIOD <BREAK>
the opposite ,COMMA as we know ,COMMA is also true ,COMMA often more true .PERIOD <BREAK>
people who have no light ,COMMA whether it's physical or metaphorical ,COMMA cannot pass our exams ,COMMA and we can never know what they know .PERIOD <BREAK>
in effect a pair of roving eyeglasses ,COMMA a cutting-edge example of where miniaturization can lead if the operator is remote from the vehicle .PERIOD <BREAK>
but before we pat ourselves too much on the back ,COMMA we have poured <NUM> megawatt hours of energy into constructing this house when there was a house there before .PERIOD <BREAK>
they're healthy ;SEMICOLON they're clean -- it's amazing .PERIOD <BREAK>
but sometimes it's very paradoxical .PERIOD <BREAK>
and in this rapidly evolving context ,COMMA it's possible to imagine a world in which the mobile phone becomes something far more than a medium for social interaction .PERIOD <BREAK>
so in aurora ,COMMA colorado it's a bench .PERIOD <BREAK>
they actually do conduct a few investigations overseas -- about a dozen a year -- maybe <NUM> in a good year .PERIOD <BREAK>
this works in physics .PERIOD this works in geology .PERIOD but if this is normal science ,COMMA what does neuroscience look like ?QUESTIONMARK this is what neuroscience looks like .PERIOD <BREAK>
and you'll see ,COMMA there's some damage to the surface of the coral .PERIOD <BREAK>
in <NUM> the unsold stock was purchased by maurice haverpiece ,COMMA a wealthy prune juice bottler ,COMMA and consolidated to form the core collection .PERIOD <BREAK>
this was my father in vietnam .PERIOD <BREAK>
those of you who may remember me from tedglobal remember me asking a few questions which still preoccupy me .PERIOD <BREAK>
i don't know exactly how to do this yet ,COMMA but ,COMMA you know ,COMMA it's something being actively thought about .PERIOD <BREAK>
here's his first bit of advice .PERIOD <BREAK>
and we keep getting wells that are farther away from the ground .PERIOD <BREAK>
so what is the picture that we get here ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
so it tends to get discounted .PERIOD <BREAK>
and this particular set here can transmit something of the order of three to five terabits per second .PERIOD <BREAK>
and we can't fix it because i .PERIOD m .PERIOD pei's still alive ,COMMA and every year harvard and m .PERIOD i .PERIOD t .PERIOD have a joint committee to repair it .PERIOD <BREAK>
then malé ,COMMA then further south .PERIOD <BREAK>
but there is a countervailing force in the universe -- the tendency towards spontaneous order .PERIOD and so that's our theme .PERIOD <BREAK>
so deep inside -- we all know ,COMMA you go sufficiently far down ,COMMA you have atoms .PERIOD <BREAK>
the issue is not urban poverty .PERIOD <BREAK>
looking at the five major rivers that feed bangladesh .PERIOD <BREAK>
this song is one of thomas' favorites ,COMMA called what you do with what you've got .PERIOD <BREAK>
here in <NUM> ,COMMA you know ,COMMA it's not an easy thing to be a forest ecologist ,COMMA gripping ourselves with these kinds of questions and trying to figure out how we can answer them .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the rooster ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
leaders need to connect to each other and to their followers ,COMMA and they need to bring them along on what is an often arduous journey into a peaceful future .PERIOD <BREAK>
he's in taiwan right now .PERIOD <BREAK>
so the problem i had is that the worldview that my students had corresponds to reality in the world the year their teachers were born .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA this was the contents page originally .PERIOD <BREAK>
the value of the past also comes alive ;SEMICOLON it provides a lot of company .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's not that hard a problem .PERIOD <BREAK>
who is entitled to what ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
we'll wait for the slow ones .PERIOD ok .PERIOD <BREAK>
thank you very much .PERIOD <BREAK>
think of it as the ultimate junk shot .PERIOD <BREAK>
okay ,COMMA i have no idea what we're going to play .PERIOD <BREAK>
but the ones who are think that these sorts of human interactions involving kindness ,COMMA care and empathy are an essential part of the job .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's where you expect to find stuff .PERIOD <BREAK>
there was the washing of hands .PERIOD <BREAK>
he could just deliver them .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the beauty of this ,COMMA in perhaps <NUM> years ,COMMA <NUM> years ,COMMA we can finish completely this civilization ,COMMA and offer to our children the possibility to invent a new story ,COMMA a new poetry ,COMMA a new romanticism .PERIOD <BREAK>
so why should you care about that ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
i have a solution that requires neither machine ,COMMA nor wood ,COMMA nor cooking gas .PERIOD <BREAK>
i mean ,COMMA probability and statistics ,COMMA it's the mathematics of games and gambling .PERIOD <BREAK>
i mean ,COMMA curiosity -- excuse me .PERIOD <BREAK>
each increment gets a serial number and a certificate ,COMMA and then the brewers and others buy those certificates as a way to return water to these degraded ecosystems .PERIOD <BREAK>
and they become the bedrock of any harbor ecosystem .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA the two of us were just like ,COMMA oh my god ,COMMA oh my god .PERIOD <BREAK>
so everybody must be able to say ,COMMA this happened to me ,COMMA and it did this with me ,COMMA but i'm able to live with it ,COMMA to cope with it ,COMMA and to learn from it .PERIOD <BREAK>
look at the end to see the animal .PERIOD <BREAK>
what's happening is we're taking this technology -- it's becoming more precise ,COMMA more potent -- and we're turning it back upon ourselves .PERIOD <BREAK>
we then pull the piles up through the dune and we're able to create almost any conceivable shape inside of the sand with the sand acting as a mold as we go up .PERIOD <BREAK>
so it's very much like the cycle on earth except because it's so cold ,COMMA it could not be water ,COMMA you know ,COMMA because water would have frozen .PERIOD <BREAK>
so i'm going to tell you a little story .PERIOD <BREAK>
you can get on a flight in london ,COMMA you can end up in bangalore later today .PERIOD <BREAK>
i remember putting that film out and going to cynics .PERIOD <BREAK>
so as you can see ,COMMA it's in a churchyard ;SEMICOLON it's in scotland .PERIOD it's behind a protective wall .PERIOD <BREAK>
thank you .PERIOD <BREAK>
employees volunteer time in the advice booth .PERIOD <BREAK>
there's been kind of a series of epiphanies .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it spread because of the power of an idea -- so the very ,COMMA very simple idea about turning education on its head and putting the things which were marginal ,COMMA things like working in teams ,COMMA doing practical projects ,COMMA and putting them right at the heart of learning ,COMMA rather than on the edges .PERIOD <BREAK>
now ,COMMA the unexpected thing about this is that zach could stand up on stage and drench a perfectly innocent member of the audience without any concern that we'd damage the electronics ,COMMA that we'd get him wet ,COMMA that we'd hurt the books or the computers .PERIOD it works because it's non-conductive .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's pretty bleak .PERIOD <BREAK>
how many of them showed up for him ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
humans have always been the greatest threat to penguins ,COMMA but we are now their only hope .PERIOD <BREAK>
there's at least three viruses that you know about ,COMMA which are in this particular monkey .PERIOD <BREAK>
and because you can't bind the oxygen ,COMMA maybe you wouldn't consume it ,COMMA and then maybe it would reduce your demand for oxygen .PERIOD <BREAK>
we had all sorts of help from all walks of life .PERIOD <BREAK>
so spinning forward ,COMMA one of the guys who read this article was a guy called doug engelbart ,COMMA and he was a u .PERIOD s .PERIOD air force officer .PERIOD <BREAK>
for example ,COMMA from the third organism we sequenced ,COMMA methanococcus jannaschii -- it lives in boiling water temperatures ;SEMICOLON its energy source is hydrogen and all its carbon comes from co <NUM> it captures back from the environment .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's because ,COMMA well ,COMMA thousands of years ago ,COMMA people invented ideas -- they had ideas ,COMMA innovations ,COMMA technology -- and the stone age ended ,COMMA not because we ran out of stones .PERIOD <BREAK>
there is a game called rush hour .PERIOD <BREAK>
so they are introducing new diamond shreddies .PERIOD <BREAK>
you notice the clay on the soles of her feet .PERIOD <BREAK>
and you know ,COMMA it felt really good to cry for my brother .PERIOD <BREAK>
if you take into account <NUM> percent of all americans were born after world war ii ,COMMA this is essentially our depression .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so there's no way that this is going to work .PERIOD <BREAK>
they're going to show they're on your side .PERIOD <BREAK>
i would love to have something in the fourth place here ,COMMA but in terms of constant ,COMMA clean ,COMMA scalable energy ,COMMA [solar] and wind and the other renewables aren't there yet because they're inconstant .PERIOD <BREAK>
shame ,COMMA for women ,COMMA is this web of unobtainable ,COMMA conflicting ,COMMA competing expectations about who we're supposed to be .PERIOD <BREAK>
complexity is the problem that any theory of biology has to solve ,COMMA and you can't solve it by postulating an agent that is even more complex ,COMMA thereby simply compounding the problem .PERIOD <BREAK>
that links with hotdiggitydog .PERIOD com .PERIOD <BREAK>
conversely ,COMMA there is no concentration at which the sulfur compound will smell like vodka .PERIOD <BREAK>
in some of the other amazing caves that we work in -- this is in lechuguilla cave in new mexico near carlsbad ,COMMA and this is one of the most famous caves in the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
first ,COMMA it allows us to showcase our arab filmmakers and voices to one of the most cosmopolitan cities in the world ,COMMA new york city .PERIOD <BREAK>
now this ,COMMA we make lots and lots of pumps .PERIOD <BREAK>
there will be invisible capacity .PERIOD invisible capacity in our bodies ,COMMA in our brains ,COMMA and in the air .PERIOD <BREAK>
so since i was here last in ' <NUM> ,COMMA we discovered that global climate change is turning out to be a pretty serious issue ,COMMA so we covered that fairly extensively in skeptic magazine .PERIOD <BREAK>
now molecules are really ,COMMA really tiny .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i said ,COMMA well look ,COMMA i'll pay you ,COMMA you can be my teacher ,COMMA and i'll come each day and pay you .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i think it's good to talk about things i know nothing about because i bring a fresh viewpoint to it ,COMMA you know ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
when my first novel written in english came out in america ,COMMA i heard an interesting remark from a literary critic .PERIOD <BREAK>
in fact ,COMMA often ,COMMA as we've seen happen in a lot of the arab spring revolts ,COMMA often those divisions are along religious lines .PERIOD <BREAK>
so first of all ,COMMA i'd like to say something about memetics and the theory of memes ,COMMA and secondly ,COMMA how this might answer questions about who's out there ,COMMA if indeed anyone is .PERIOD <BREAK>
if you run out of medicine ,COMMA you definitely die .PERIOD <BREAK>
i think we have an obligation as parents and a society to start teaching our kids to fish instead of giving them the fish -- the old parable :COLON if you give a man a fish ,COMMA you feed him for a day .PERIOD <BREAK>
now ,COMMA by remoteness ,COMMA i mean two or three different kinds of things .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is very substantial .PERIOD <BREAK>
we want our babies to read when they are six months old .PERIOD <BREAK>
a lot of very handsome and pretty people here ,COMMA skinny ,COMMA chubby ,COMMA different races ,COMMA cultures .PERIOD we are all <NUM> .PERIOD <NUM> % genetically equal .PERIOD <BREAK>
he's been a soldier ,COMMA a teacher ,COMMA a politician ,COMMA a vice-mayor and a business man .PERIOD <BREAK>
the matriarch that they were radio tracking ,COMMA after weeks of moving back and forth ,COMMA in and out of the park ,COMMA came to a halt outside the park .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's interesting .PERIOD <BREAK>
the good projects ,COMMA which we as a donor community would take under our wings ,COMMA they took years ,COMMA you know ,COMMA you had too many studies ,COMMA and very often they didn't succeed .PERIOD <BREAK>
institutions hate being told they're obstacles .PERIOD <BREAK>
there is the totality of all the people who have come to it .PERIOD <BREAK>
one is the large global economy ,COMMA the large globalized economy ,COMMA and the other one is the small ,COMMA and very limited ,COMMA capacity of our traditional governments and their international institutions to govern ,COMMA to shape ,COMMA this economy .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's made up -- it's made up of <NUM> different countries .PERIOD <BREAK>
the theme of this morning's session is things we make .PERIOD <BREAK>
she's nude .PERIOD <BREAK>
my company has <NUM> million images .PERIOD <BREAK>
and she goes ,COMMA then how do they get fertilized ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
this experience raised a lot of questions ,COMMA among them questions about race and equality and for whom in our country opportunities and options are available .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's not happening ,COMMA and it's time .PERIOD <BREAK>
we put a mask on it ,COMMA looked at it deep down in the ground ,COMMA checked it out from all sides ,COMMA west ,COMMA north ,COMMA south ,COMMA east ,COMMA top and bottom .PERIOD <BREAK>
and they watched for a few minutes and he turned to her mother and said ,COMMA mrs .PERIOD lynne ,COMMA gillian isn't sick ;SEMICOLON she's a dancer .PERIOD <BREAK>
so they will ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA be quite easy for us to detect .PERIOD <BREAK>
we cannot put it into two parts .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so we spent a lot of time -- this has been going on for about seven or eight years ,COMMA this project -- and [we're] just ready to start building them .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA i'm not free of all of this .PERIOD but it's worked .PERIOD it's always worked .PERIOD <BREAK>
i wish to go to school .PERIOD <BREAK>
and finally ,COMMA at the ecosystem level ,COMMA whether it's flood prevention or drought control provided by the forests ,COMMA or whether it is the ability of poor farmers to go out and gather leaf litter for their cattle and goats ,COMMA or whether it's the ability of their wives to go and collect fuel wood from the forest ,COMMA it is actually the poor who depend most on these ecosystem services .PERIOD <BREAK>
but it's more profound than fun .PERIOD <BREAK>
understand it .PERIOD appreciate it .PERIOD celebrate it .PERIOD <BREAK>
so hyperscore lets you start from scratch very quickly .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is a smaller one ,COMMA and i have a little moving torso on there .PERIOD <BREAK>
here's a great idea to spread :COLON end polio now .PERIOD <BREAK>
so now ,COMMA the thing is that this is a different kind of spell .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's going to come gradually at first .PERIOD it's going to pick up speed .PERIOD <BREAK>
you want to keep your mouth open ,COMMA so your eardrums don't burst from the pressures .PERIOD <BREAK>
from the photosynthetic growth ,COMMA it would take <NUM> years of that growth to produce what we use ,COMMA the <NUM> billion barrels we use per year .PERIOD <BREAK>
the science of complexity is probably the greatest challenge of all ,COMMA greater than that of the very small on the left and the very large on the right .PERIOD <BREAK>
so we forget ,COMMA but we're also adaptable ,COMMA and we adapt to situations around us pretty well .PERIOD <BREAK>
they're tiny .PERIOD they're barely visible as a piece of material ,COMMA and to show <NUM> .PERIOD <NUM> million of them required a canvas that was larger than any printer in the world would print .PERIOD <BREAK>
so how do the children do science ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
now there are two groups that exist within the muslim world .PERIOD <BREAK>
is it working ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and i can tell you this happens ,COMMA because it happened to me .PERIOD <BREAK>
i was eliminating the data to get the true pattern of the data to shine through .PERIOD <BREAK>
so that would be ,COMMA roughly ,COMMA <NUM> people have died since i've begun speaking .PERIOD <BREAK>
they get to close the loop with their products .PERIOD <BREAK>
and there isn't much we can do about that .PERIOD <BREAK>
either you've rigged it by design ,COMMA or you've got enough data so there's no need to randomize people anymore .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA if we run this program ,COMMA this is what we get .PERIOD <BREAK>
so i have proposed to apply the same trick to looking for life in the universe .PERIOD <BREAK>
it asked them to reach outside of the school walls and to think about how they could play a role in the community's development .PERIOD <BREAK>
that's a very new situation .PERIOD <BREAK>
here my friend jessica sent me a picture of her head laceration so i can save her a trip to the emergency room -- i can do some diagnostics that way .PERIOD <BREAK>
i think it would be something out of the aquatic ape thing ,COMMA wouldn't it ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
it's being used in uganda to give some psychological help to ex-child soldiers .PERIOD <BREAK>
for the last three years ,COMMA i was shooting the earth for the movie .PERIOD <BREAK>

now ,COMMA this is the part of the talk where i tell you what's going to come as a result of all of this ,COMMA but i'm running out of time ,COMMA which is good ,COMMA because i don't know .PERIOD <BREAK>
so now we've got the stuff color-sorted ,COMMA angle maps onto color .PERIOD <BREAK>
it is very powerful .PERIOD it is very exciting .PERIOD <BREAK>
this kind of technology is going to let even more people get into it ,COMMA and i'm really looking forward to interacting with all you guys over the next few days and seeing how it can apply to your respective fields .PERIOD <BREAK>

as soon as i focused on this material ,COMMA i took off .PERIOD <BREAK>
on an astronomical scale that's a very small black hole .PERIOD <BREAK>
he's a big guy .PERIOD <BREAK>
you can look at the interaction between how i treat my als .PERIOD <BREAK>
you don't think about how nicole kidman is maneuvering that dress -- she just looks completely natural .PERIOD <BREAK>
we don't want to believe what we know .PERIOD <BREAK>
so i was amazed .PERIOD <BREAK>
and because the life cast ,COMMA or the bust -- the maquette -- of benjamin was made from brad ,COMMA we could transpose the data of brad at <NUM> onto brad at <NUM> .PERIOD <BREAK>
and these are powerful water totems .PERIOD <BREAK>
so what is the lesson behind it ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
i'd like to talk to you today about the scale of the scientific effort that goes into making the headlines you see in the paper .PERIOD <BREAK>
if money actually made you happy ,COMMA then the wealthiest people in the world would be the happiest .PERIOD <BREAK>
i will answer ,COMMA my lord !EXCLAMATIONMARK only to make you happy !EXCLAMATIONMARK <BREAK>
but i was saying thanks all the time ,COMMA every day ,COMMA and i started to change my perspective .PERIOD <BREAK>
i saw one day ,COMMA the largest school in afghanistan ,COMMA a girls' school .PERIOD <BREAK>
hope always ,COMMA always finds a way .PERIOD thank you .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i told them -- my people ,COMMA with the americans here -- separate .PERIOD <BREAK>
i simply needed vision and belief .PERIOD <BREAK>
these are opium-addicted people on the roofs of kabul <NUM> years after the beginning of our war .PERIOD <BREAK>
so that's a different way to look at stuff .PERIOD <BREAK>
but to be fair ,COMMA it lives in the deep waters of the mid-atlantic ridge ,COMMA so it was a lot harder to find .PERIOD <BREAK>
and many of these chemicals are now linked to the skyrocketing incidents of chronic childhood disease that we're seeing across industrialized nations .PERIOD <BREAK>
not a lot of other diseases have that profile .PERIOD and you can see here -- this is a graph of death rates by age in botswana and egypt .PERIOD <BREAK>
when i lift the heap ,COMMA i peek .PERIOD <BREAK>
we are looking at a number of energy prizes .PERIOD <BREAK>
there's a thousand battle-related deaths a year in this area twice the size of maryland ,COMMA and it's all related to the oil .PERIOD <BREAK>

he can't use the stones ,COMMA but he can stop them .PERIOD <BREAK>
there's more than <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> species of insects that are being eaten all around the globe .PERIOD <BREAK>
and you start to see things .PERIOD <BREAK>
this picture was taken from an orbiting satellite .PERIOD <BREAK>
and there he is ,COMMA a little bush baby on -- caught in the headlights there .PERIOD <BREAK>
but indeed ,COMMA the laws of quantum mechanics can be written down on a napkin ,COMMA and yet they govern all of chemistry ,COMMA all of life ,COMMA all of history .PERIOD <BREAK>
well obviously i had to find a lab to work at because i didn't have the equipment in my school .PERIOD <BREAK>
when you paste an image ,COMMA it's just paper and glue .PERIOD <BREAK>
i can use it in my company .PERIOD <BREAK>
this amazes me .PERIOD this is a product i just found out .PERIOD <BREAK>
everyone comes back from heaven ,COMMA but never from hell .PERIOD <BREAK>
a year and a half ago ,COMMA four of the five people who are full time members at ushahidi ,COMMA which means testimony in swahili ,COMMA were ted fellows .PERIOD <BREAK>

i'm asking about our human ancestry ,COMMA things that we would recognize as being like us if they were sitting here in the room .PERIOD <BREAK>
there is depth records ,COMMA where people go as deep as they can .PERIOD <BREAK>
and small groups are more prone to accidents and bad luck .PERIOD <BREAK>
nasa had no interest ;SEMICOLON they tried to kill the project .PERIOD <BREAK>
so we've chatted about a couple of behavioral challenges .PERIOD <BREAK>
and this brings up the whole thing of my science teacher .PERIOD <BREAK>
that was a great day for my mother .PERIOD <BREAK>
i think that is the progress of cities .PERIOD <BREAK>
even the poorest neighborhoods give more than they can afford .PERIOD <BREAK>
his parents were jewish ,COMMA russian and above all ,COMMA very poor .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is an aspirational graph .PERIOD <BREAK>
when you have two of anything -- two eyes ,COMMA two ears ,COMMA two noses ,COMMA just two protrusions -- those all partake of the form of two .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i think that we can apply social networks and online payment systems to completely change how people feel about ridesharing and make that trip much more efficient .PERIOD <BREAK>
pay careful attention the next time you read the financial news .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA in architecture we deal with big assemblies of components ,COMMA so there might be up to ,COMMA say ,COMMA <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> pieces of material in this room you're sitting in right now that all need to get organized .PERIOD <BREAK>
that was the start of my journey to make this film ,COMMA toxic baby .PERIOD <BREAK>
we're all choking ,COMMA and there's smoke pouring through the vents ,COMMA under the doors .PERIOD there's people screaming .PERIOD <BREAK>
the reason why i'm here today ,COMMA in part ,COMMA is because of a dog :COLON an abandoned puppy i found back in the rain ,COMMA back in <NUM> .PERIOD <BREAK>
and he was writing his blog one day ,COMMA and his wife gave birth to her baby at <NUM> weeks .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it gets worse ,COMMA i crashed it into your house .PERIOD <BREAK>
you have to reframe it and ask ,COMMA what is responsible ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
there it is .PERIOD <BREAK>
we didn't have money ,COMMA so we had a cheap ,COMMA little ad ,COMMA but we wanted college students for a study of prison life .PERIOD <BREAK>
maybe i can use my jewelry to create extra sounds .PERIOD <BREAK>
which is why i was surprised a few months later to see her back in our own town ,COMMA getting her subsequent care with her private oncologist .PERIOD <BREAK>
after that you have two options .PERIOD <BREAK>
globalize trade .PERIOD <BREAK>
if you have content that others are uploading to youtube ,COMMA you should register in the content id system ,COMMA and then you'll have the choice about how your content is used .PERIOD <BREAK>
rather ,COMMA local leaders committed to revisiting them later on .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it was galois who produced a language to be able to answer some of these questions .PERIOD <BREAK>
and they go up to the cath lab and boom ,COMMA boom ,COMMA boom get rid of the clot .PERIOD <BREAK>
i feared he'd go and take his silences with him ,COMMA and take his secrets with him .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the third ,COMMA democratic choice in muslim-majority societies has been relegated to a political choice ,COMMA meaning political parties in many of these societies ask people to vote for them as the democratic party ,COMMA but then the other parties ask them to vote for them as the military party -- wanting to rule by military dictatorship .PERIOD <BREAK>
but then what was the answer of the regime ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
recently the economist recognized this ,COMMA but i stumbled upon the idea <NUM> years ago ,COMMA and that's what i've been working on .PERIOD <BREAK>
that's where she has to pull herself out from the depths of mortality ,COMMA come in ,COMMA release her spirit .PERIOD <BREAK>
so one of the things that that's leading to is a sort of southern cultural explosion .PERIOD <BREAK>
i would like one media hit for every person on the planet who is living on less than one dollar a day .PERIOD <BREAK>
we took off all the visible hardware and trim that was kind of doing the country cabin thing .PERIOD <BREAK>
four feet .PERIOD nothing larger than the sum of her figurative parts .PERIOD <BREAK>
it looks like i got a baldessari painting for free .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the story of globalization is largely a story of non-zero-sumness .PERIOD <BREAK>
for the koran always urges us to remember ,COMMA to remind each other ,COMMA because the knowledge of truth is within every human being .PERIOD <BREAK>
so here i am with the couple ,COMMA the three of us shrinking at the foot of calvary about to be up ,COMMA you know .PERIOD <BREAK>
now ,COMMA this is a rear-projected drafting table .PERIOD it's about <NUM> inches wide and it's equipped with a multi-touch sensor .PERIOD now ,COMMA normal touch sensors that you see ,COMMA like on a kiosk or interactive whiteboards ,COMMA can only register one point of contact at a time .PERIOD <BREAK>
the master said ,COMMA 'thou didst thy best ,COMMA that is success .PERIOD ' from those things ,COMMA and one other perhaps ,COMMA i coined my own definition of success ,COMMA which is :COLON peace of mind attained only through self-satisfaction in knowing you made the effort to do the best of which you're capable .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it's not based on theology or philosophy ,COMMA it's in the study of the mind ,COMMA across all these spheres of research ,COMMA from neuroscience to the cognitive scientists ,COMMA behavioral economists ,COMMA psychologists ,COMMA sociology ,COMMA we're developing a revolution in consciousness .PERIOD <BREAK>
this shows you life expectancy against gross national income -- how rich countries are on average .PERIOD <BREAK>
here's the number of people in higher education .PERIOD <BREAK>
those were the achievements of our great regime .PERIOD <BREAK>
he said ,COMMA well ,COMMA i built a company called ebay .PERIOD <BREAK>
unfortunately ,COMMA the science is probably closer to being climatology in that in many cases ,COMMA very ,COMMA very small changes can have disproportionately huge effects ,COMMA and equally ,COMMA vast areas of activity ,COMMA enormous mergers ,COMMA can actually accomplish absolutely bugger-all .PERIOD <BREAK>
but back in <NUM> ,COMMA the question joel and i kept turning over and over was why this late in the game so much energy was being spent talking about the science when the policies necessary to address climate change were unequivocally beneficial for humanity in the long run regardless of the science .PERIOD <BREAK>
craig venter showed up last year and showed you the first fully programmable cell that acts like hardware where you can insert dna and have it boot up as a different species .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the entry point for his right hand -- notice this ,COMMA he's not reaching in front and catching the water .PERIOD <BREAK>
so if the amygdala is excited ,COMMA and this is something important ,COMMA the messages then cascade into the autonomic nervous system .PERIOD <BREAK>

one third of americans .PERIOD <BREAK>
we don't want to be buying oil ;SEMICOLON we want to be doing something green .PERIOD <BREAK>

in <NUM> i went to liberia ,COMMA where a group of my friends and i did an independent ,COMMA self-funded film ,COMMA still in progress ,COMMA on a very legendary and brutal war-lord named general butt naked .PERIOD <BREAK>
and perhaps most important of all ,COMMA it is unsustainable because of climate change ,COMMA resource depletion and species destruction .PERIOD <BREAK>
the choir people in my high school were pretty geeky ,COMMA and there was no way i was going to have anything to do with those people .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i thought it was astonishing to speculate ,COMMA as if this were a competition ,COMMA on something that was such a fresh wound .PERIOD <BREAK>
let me go back to diarrhea for a second .PERIOD <BREAK>
now we've switched to critical mass .PERIOD <BREAK>
we have white sharks and blue sharks .PERIOD <BREAK>
so that was the <NUM> th century .PERIOD <BREAK>
now we've used this research to try to understand not just how a normal person develops ,COMMA and elaborates their skills and abilities ,COMMA but also try to understand the origins of impairment ,COMMA and the origins of differences or variations that might limit the capacities of a child ,COMMA or an adult .PERIOD <BREAK>
and when that happens ,COMMA the feeling is ecstatic and we reach for metaphors of up and down to explain these feelings .PERIOD <BREAK>
young boys are taught justifications for suicide attacks and the execution of spies .PERIOD <BREAK>
please go cut that piece out .PERIOD <BREAK>
we've been talking a lot about the horrific impacts of plastic on the planet and on other species ,COMMA but plastic hurts people too ,COMMA especially poor people .PERIOD <BREAK>
they have all kinds of little strategies to keep from overeating ,COMMA which ,COMMA as you know ,COMMA is a big problem here in america .PERIOD <BREAK>
he closes it down for five months to experiment with a full kitchen staff .PERIOD <BREAK>
i discard it .PERIOD <BREAK>
three ,COMMA property rights .PERIOD <BREAK>
and that's what i did a few years ago when i took that five-level hierarchy of needs pyramid and turned it into what i call the transformation pyramid ,COMMA which is survival ,COMMA success and transformation .PERIOD <BREAK>
what tribes are ,COMMA is a very simple concept that goes back <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> years .PERIOD <BREAK>
the solution ,COMMA i think ,COMMA is that we use language at two levels :COLON the literal form signals the safest relationship with the listener ,COMMA whereas the implicated content -- the reading between the lines that we count on the listener to perform -- allows the listener to derive the interpretation which is most relevant in context ,COMMA which possibly initiates a changed relationship .PERIOD <BREAK>
why haven't we been more inspired by nature and these kinds of discoveries ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
our <NUM> percent obesity rate is high ,COMMA even for this country ,COMMA and diabetes comes with it .PERIOD <BREAK>
every city determines to a very large extent the amount of energy used by its inhabitants .PERIOD <BREAK>

our mission was to fix the world's media .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's like a rainbow .PERIOD <BREAK>
music i used to hear was bombs and fire of guns .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i want to give you the answer of this deep scientific thought .PERIOD <BREAK>
our cars have sensors by which they magically can see everything around them and make decisions about every aspect of driving .PERIOD <BREAK>
whereas with islam as a majority religion and christianity ,COMMA you see countries all the way .PERIOD <BREAK>
and what about the people who love you and who see you spending -- you keep getting caught up in these new projects ,COMMA but it almost feels like you're addicted to launching new stuff .PERIOD <BREAK>
mahmoud was going to be discharged with his new legs .PERIOD <BREAK>
i remember one time being up near the summit ,COMMA i reached into my down jacket for a drink from my water bottle ,COMMA inside my down jacket ,COMMA only to discover that the water was already frozen solid .PERIOD <BREAK>
we need to shine light to see what we're doing .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i wanted to do something to help ,COMMA but i always wondered ,COMMA what could one person possibly do to make a difference ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
one answer would be :COLON because the kinetic energy of the water molecules is high and they bounce against things rapidly -- that's a kind of physical science argument .PERIOD <BREAK>
this was an investment opportunity for someone that excited the imagination of people .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i had these legs made a little over a year ago at dorset orthopedic in england and when i brought them home to manhattan ,COMMA my first night out on the town ,COMMA i went to a very fancy party .PERIOD <BREAK>
among the <NUM> million migrant workers ,COMMA <NUM> percent of them are young people .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the key to this is a guide who has been on that mountain ,COMMA in every temperature ,COMMA at every period -- a guide who ,COMMA above all ,COMMA knows when to turn back ,COMMA who doesn't press on relentlessly when conditions turn against them .PERIOD <BREAK>
the commercial picture is that there really isn't much of one ,COMMA i guess .PERIOD <BREAK>
it is impossible to talk about the single story without talking about power .PERIOD <BREAK>
an <NUM> cent gallon means ,COMMA if the entire pacific would convert to crude oil ,COMMA and we'd let any oil company bring it out and refine it ,COMMA they still can't compete with two cents a mile .PERIOD <BREAK>
i mean ,COMMA what would it take to persuade our culture to downplay it ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
so ,COMMA ok .PERIOD <BREAK>
in the most recent elections in the muslim world -- which are those in pakistan ,COMMA those in morocco and those in turkey -- in each case ,COMMA people who present themselves to the electorate as islamic democrats were far and away the most successful vote-getters every place they were allowed to run freely .PERIOD <BREAK>
and then ,COMMA we fast-forward to about <NUM> ,COMMA when three italian psychiatrists ,COMMA who were largely treating depression ,COMMA began to notice among their patients ,COMMA who were also epileptics ,COMMA that if they had an epileptic -- a series of epileptic fits ,COMMA a lot of them in a row -- the depression would very frequently lift .PERIOD <BREAK>
but justice is a tougher standard than charity .PERIOD <BREAK>
thank you .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA safe is the last exhibition that i did at moma and it ended at the beginning of last year .PERIOD <BREAK>
it makes him a better student at school because it inspires in him a sense of responsibility ,COMMA perseverance and punctuality that will greatly help him at school .PERIOD <BREAK>
now what does riccardo muti do ?QUESTIONMARK he does something like this .PERIOD <BREAK>
which one of these guys am i actually related to ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
it's got living coral ,COMMA fish all over the place ,COMMA crystal clear water ,COMMA and you go ,COMMA how did that happen ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and the consensus was :COLON it really worked .PERIOD <BREAK>
now before i tell you about the technology ,COMMA the bad news is that a significant fraction of us in this room ,COMMA if we live long enough ,COMMA will encounter ,COMMA perhaps ,COMMA a brain disorder .PERIOD <BREAK>
if you just take four percentage points and put it into this basket ,COMMA you would have a transformative effect .PERIOD <BREAK>
and this is not surprising .PERIOD we know that some people are born shy and some are born gregarious .PERIOD that's obvious .PERIOD <BREAK>
both myself and my brother belong to the under <NUM> demographic ,COMMA which pat said makes <NUM> percent ,COMMA but according to our statistics it makes <NUM> percent of the region's population .PERIOD <BREAK>
you can make money ,COMMA you can lose money in africa .PERIOD <BREAK>
so for us ,COMMA this was a graphic public campaign called connect bertie .PERIOD <BREAK>
she said ,COMMA but it's too high .PERIOD <BREAK>
and then he said ,COMMA do you accept my health insurance ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and before that ,COMMA i was a silversmith ,COMMA and before that ,COMMA i was -- i was out of the house at about <NUM> and a half ,COMMA and i never wound up going into college .PERIOD <BREAK>
we invited <NUM> of the top mars scientists to the langley research center for two days .PERIOD <BREAK>
around the same ,COMMA according to alex ross who writes for the new yorker ,COMMA this kind of rule came into effect that audiences had to be quiet -- no more eating ,COMMA drinking and yelling at the stage ,COMMA or gossiping with one another during the show .PERIOD <BREAK>
so we call it a relational universe .PERIOD <BREAK>
it comes with the monsoons .PERIOD <BREAK>
silk road connotes independence and mutual trust .PERIOD <BREAK>
mahatma gandhi ,COMMA one of the greatest civil fighters of all time ,COMMA said ,COMMA be the change you wish to see in the world .PERIOD <BREAK>

the idea goes like this :COLON imagine space is a substrate of all there is .PERIOD <BREAK>
in <NUM> and <NUM> i did stories on the delhi fire service ,COMMA the dfs ,COMMA which ,COMMA during the summer ,COMMA is probably the world's most active fire department .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is part of that genome .PERIOD <BREAK>
so i'm a researcher-storyteller ,COMMA and i'm going to talk to you today -- we're talking about expanding perception -- and so i want to talk to you and tell some stories about a piece of my research that fundamentally expanded my perception and really actually changed the way that i live and love and work and parent .PERIOD <BREAK>
you place the muscle cells on the outside .PERIOD <BREAK>
so they're testing its virulence .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is a fairly heavily litigated area ,COMMA so we've found that there are niches in the music world that aren't served terribly well by the classic commercial publishing system .PERIOD <BREAK>
and look around you and know that what we really care about is that little bit of difference .PERIOD <BREAK>
so what we did is we collected some samples -- just as a way of testing -- from hospitals ,COMMA trained rats on them and see if this works ,COMMA and wonder ,COMMA well ,COMMA we can reach <NUM> percent sensitivity ,COMMA <NUM> percent specificity using multiple rats in a row .PERIOD <BREAK>
that's a really scary thought ,COMMA that one game dynamic can change things so powerfully .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i'm just trying not to panic and freak out .PERIOD so i like ,COMMA take a deep breath .PERIOD <BREAK>
i felt pretty good ,COMMA considering .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i doubt anybody in this room could really hold their breath for <NUM> .PERIOD <NUM> minutes .PERIOD <BREAK>
what is the imagery of god ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
you know the uni is the most challenging ,COMMA so number ten is challenging .PERIOD <BREAK>
use science to ,COMMA you know ,COMMA work backwards and say ,COMMA well ,COMMA really ,COMMA what were they thinking ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
bill clinton :COLON i want you to listen to me .PERIOD <BREAK>

they'd caused the water to back up ,COMMA they needed electric ,COMMA hydroelectric power .PERIOD <BREAK>
if we'd evolved in a vacuum ,COMMA we would expect them to hit the ground simultaneously .PERIOD if we were bacteria ,COMMA constantly buffeted by thermal movements of molecules ,COMMA it would be different ,COMMA but we middle worlders are too big to notice brownian motion .PERIOD <BREAK>
the junk food industry is really great at pressing our pleasure buttons and figuring out what's the most pleasurable .PERIOD <BREAK>
jim dipeso of republicans for environmental protection describes it thusly :COLON transparent .PERIOD market-based .PERIOD <BREAK>
but what gave us hope were these incredibly dedicated and brave volunteers -- three of whom here are force-feeding penguins .PERIOD <BREAK>

twenty-five percent of all the world's plants ,COMMA by <NUM> .PERIOD <BREAK>

well ,COMMA you know ,COMMA as ron st .PERIOD john -- i hope you'll go and meet him in the dinner afterwards and talk to him -- when he started gphin -- in <NUM> ,COMMA there was an outbreak of bird flu .PERIOD <BREAK>

most people fled abroad .PERIOD <BREAK>
i'm at carnegie mellon ;SEMICOLON we've got a great robotics institute there .PERIOD <BREAK>

you're getting in a lot less information than you think .PERIOD <BREAK>
other examples you can see here are from latvia ,COMMA lithuania ,COMMA estonia -- the central european countries .PERIOD <BREAK>
she said ,COMMA the first thing anyone who is a muslim knows is that the koran requires and strongly supports literacy .PERIOD <BREAK>

i'd like to talk about what i call digital food .PERIOD <BREAK>
they define what the system is .PERIOD <BREAK>
we failed three other times .PERIOD <BREAK>
do we need a draft to pull this off ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and the first myth to dispel is that africa is not a country .PERIOD <BREAK>
so artist books have a lot of definitions .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i hope to god the united states government ,COMMA me ,COMMA or ted ,COMMA or somebody helps us do that ,COMMA because that would be an incredible thing for their country .PERIOD <BREAK>
we forgot about improving normal lives .PERIOD <BREAK>
that's the economic invisibility of nature .PERIOD <BREAK>
sterling study .PERIOD and i think it supremely illustrates the premise of this blue zone project .PERIOD <BREAK>
as it were ,COMMA we have this ever-evolving ,COMMA crochet taxonomic tree of life .PERIOD <BREAK>
but he explained to me that he was in a bind ,COMMA and that he was having trouble finding the kind of sex appeal and star power that the conference was known for -- so i said fine ,COMMA ted -- i mean chris .PERIOD i'll come on two conditions .PERIOD <BREAK>
and what's exciting is to see so many entrepreneurs across sectors who are building innovations that recognize that what people want is freedom and choice and opportunity .PERIOD <BREAK>
the second thing you need is light .PERIOD <BREAK>
it will redefine your sense of spirituality and faith .PERIOD <BREAK>
what we've done is to set up the center for vision in the developing world here in the university .PERIOD <BREAK>
student <NUM> :COLON what did you get ?QUESTIONMARK what did you get ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
unfortunately ,COMMA i think ,COMMA i have to say that i think attitude towards china is that of a kind of little westerner mentality .PERIOD <BREAK>
they challenge existing perspectives at the edges of science and under the most demanding of conditions .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so you can see that condoms can do so many things .PERIOD <BREAK>
i sort of think about it as the dna -- these colors ,COMMA the red ,COMMA blue ,COMMA yellow ,COMMA the primary colors and white and black .PERIOD <BREAK>
and we also sampled the outdoor air .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA howard rheingold has written a lot about this and ,COMMA i think ,COMMA is writing about this more ,COMMA but this notion of voluntary cooperation is an incredibly powerful one ,COMMA and one worth thinking about .PERIOD <BREAK>
dereck joubert :COLON well ,COMMA our lives have basically been like a super long episode of csi -- something like <NUM> years .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i'm also being told that the drum is without snares .PERIOD <BREAK>
men were taught to be men in the ways in which we are not women ,COMMA that's essentially what it is .PERIOD <BREAK>
these are people who are looking not to dodge the system's rules and regulations ,COMMA but to transform the system ,COMMA and we talk about several .PERIOD <BREAK>
and they were .PERIOD they were prepared .PERIOD <BREAK>
suddenly ,COMMA a game which earned its players <NUM> rupees a day -- so <NUM> rupees for a test match ,COMMA but if you finish in four days you only got <NUM> .PERIOD <BREAK>

i'm going to fly you into five research projects in the allosphere that are going to take you from biological macroscopic data all the way down to electron spin .PERIOD <BREAK>
we've got over <NUM> servers now in three locations .PERIOD <BREAK>
and when i read it it was one of the most uplifting moments of my life .PERIOD <BREAK>
we can measure the speeds of these galaxies ,COMMA their orbital velocities ,COMMA and figure out how much mass is in this cluster .PERIOD <BREAK>
but more importantly ,COMMA i could also show you what it looks like at the corner of one of those magnificent buildings with all the massive stone blocks ,COMMA or the fake stone blocks done with brick and stucco ,COMMA which is more often the case .PERIOD <BREAK>
myshkin ingawale ,COMMA i hope i did right by you .PERIOD <BREAK>
you take a position like that .PERIOD <BREAK>
just a few of them ,COMMA but maybe you'll get just a little hint of some of these folks .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so we decided the most obvious place to start was with tickling .PERIOD <BREAK>
and that is -- i think it's difficult for me .PERIOD <BREAK>
i guess the more you matter the more space you take up ,COMMA which explains the whole suv phenomenon .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is something ,COMMA by the way ,COMMA that lee siegel talks about in his book .PERIOD <BREAK>
and their politics are not entirely unattractive .PERIOD <BREAK>
let us think about that .PERIOD <BREAK>
i didn't .PERIOD <BREAK>
the economic consequences are almost unthinkable .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is why you can feel such a sense of cosmic union with somebody after you've made love to them .PERIOD <BREAK>
claire :COLON help !EXCLAMATIONMARK please help me !EXCLAMATIONMARK help me !EXCLAMATIONMARK help me !EXCLAMATIONMARK <BREAK>

again ,COMMA going back to those high-speed videos ,COMMA there's a pretty good hint of what might be going on .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's the perfect driving mechanism .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's like after every exam ,COMMA when i walk out ,COMMA the teacher would say ,COMMA hey ,COMMA come .PERIOD <BREAK>
there's a truck on the right .PERIOD boxes fall out of the truck .PERIOD <BREAK>
while scientists regularly publish their latest research ,COMMA we magicians do not like to share our methods and secrets .PERIOD <BREAK>

when i look at all these things that are morally ambiguous and uncomfortable ,COMMA and i consider what my intentions should be ,COMMA i realize it goes back to this identity question that i had when i was a child -- and why am i here ,COMMA and what is the meaning of my life ,COMMA and what is my place in the universe ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
so what i've learned through building these systems is that robots are actually a really intriguing social technology ,COMMA where it's actually their ability to push our social buttons and to interact with us like a partner that is a core part of their functionality .PERIOD <BREAK>
well ,COMMA it uses it to defend itself from its predators .PERIOD <BREAK>
he told his doctor ,COMMA who published a case report in a canadian medical journal under the title ,COMMA sexual intercourse as a potential treatment for intractable hiccups .PERIOD <BREAK>

for emotions ,COMMA we should not move quickly to the desert .PERIOD <BREAK>
i'm a big list maker ,COMMA so i came up with a list .PERIOD <BREAK>

i mean ,COMMA these sort of top-down ,COMMA mono-functional ,COMMA capital-intensive solutions are really not going to cut it .PERIOD <BREAK>
there are many kinds of interviews .PERIOD we know them .PERIOD <BREAK>
what i want to talk about is the unique ability that the best comedy and satire has at circumventing our ingrained perspectives -- comedy as the philosopher's stone .PERIOD <BREAK>

unlike any pop culture phenomenon before it ,COMMA video games actually allow us to become part of the machine .PERIOD <BREAK>
sopa stands for the stop online piracy act .PERIOD <BREAK>

it turns out ,COMMA merely watching a romantic comedy causes relationship satisfaction to plummet .PERIOD <BREAK>
we are more than simply national symbols of urban blight .PERIOD <BREAK>

but words ,COMMA saying things ,COMMA you know ,COMMA can be constructive ;SEMICOLON it can be really damaging .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA think of it this way .PERIOD <BREAK>
and one of the key points in the science of happiness is that happiness and unhappiness are not endpoints of a single continuum .PERIOD <BREAK>
that's so true .PERIOD <BREAK>
they say ,COMMA we dutch ,COMMA we like real ,COMMA natural ,COMMA authentic experiences .PERIOD <BREAK>
you would think that person might have made a lot of money ,COMMA achieved renown in some field .PERIOD <BREAK>

european governments ,COMMA for the most part ,COMMA haven't acknowledged responsibility ,COMMA and there's nothing to kind of to push back and up against .PERIOD <BREAK>
and you repeat that process over and over again ,COMMA until you have something that walks -- in this case ,COMMA in a straight line ,COMMA like this .PERIOD <BREAK>

that's where you take a gene out of one animal and stick it in another one .PERIOD <BREAK>

there was something about the comfort of the filter and how much information was between us and the experience .PERIOD <BREAK>
the one that's the most important is the inertia or the resistance to motion .PERIOD <BREAK>

i teach courses in physical computing and wearable electronics .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is a bit like ambition and drive -- i'm going to do that .PERIOD i'm going to work hard .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so what we would do is that i would put my hands on the wall of the music room ,COMMA and together we would listen to the sounds of the instruments ,COMMA and really try to connect with those sounds far ,COMMA far more broadly than simply depending on the ear .PERIOD <BREAK>
and then we've got a four kilowatt-hour cell on the horizon .PERIOD <BREAK>
pjc :COLON it's a very profound notion to know that we as women are at the vanguard of this .PERIOD <BREAK>
but that's it .PERIOD i'm done .PERIOD thank you very much .PERIOD <BREAK>
these are the blogs that interest me :COLON the people who just tell stories .PERIOD <BREAK>
and ,COMMA god says ,COMMA my servant continues to get nearer to me ,COMMA by doing more of what i've asked them to do -- extra credit ,COMMA we might call it -- until i love him or love her .PERIOD <BREAK>
information technologies double their capacity ,COMMA price performance ,COMMA bandwidth ,COMMA every year .PERIOD <BREAK>
she's turning it inside out .PERIOD <BREAK>
and then by analyzing the various quirks and complexities of language ,COMMA i think we can get a window onto what makes us tick .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so ,COMMA the question for my lab is whether you want to think about all the good things that bacteria do ,COMMA or all the bad things that bacteria do .PERIOD <BREAK>
what's the point i want to make ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
the twentieth century was that century where ,COMMA at least for those places we know the best ,COMMA culture moved from this read-write to read-only existence .PERIOD <BREAK>
by connecting a tribe of people who are desperate to be connected to each other .PERIOD <BREAK>
and about three years ago ,COMMA i started an exercise in openness and inclusiveness by reaching out into the open-source software community to create new digital tools for magic -- tools that could eventually be shared with other artists to start them off further on in the process and to get them to the poetry faster .PERIOD <BREAK>
by <NUM> ,COMMA the mall has died .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is the hobbesian force .PERIOD <BREAK>
right .PERIOD <BREAK>
take it out of this room .PERIOD <BREAK>
i was starting to invent my own moves and bring them to perfection .PERIOD <BREAK>
so this was comparable in size to that kind of loss .PERIOD <BREAK>
based on these findings ,COMMA i have a question for you .PERIOD <BREAK>
like the bird who flies over the field and doesn't care about the fences underneath ,COMMA all right ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
you can imagine what it was like in the winter at <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> feet .PERIOD <BREAK>
you can think of this nagging inner voice as sort of the brain's equivalent of the catholic church ,COMMA if you're an austrian like me ,COMMA or the super-ego ,COMMA if you're freudian ,COMMA or your mother ,COMMA if you're jewish .PERIOD <BREAK>
a lot of teachers are using this stuff .PERIOD ok ,COMMA what about ripping ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
he was the swiss army knife .PERIOD <BREAK>
and again ,COMMA this is a pretty big march to take here .PERIOD <BREAK>
what's known out there for veterinarians is kind of basic information .PERIOD <BREAK>
we had a meeting that evening with his contractor of choice ,COMMA and the contractor showed up with the drawings of the platform about half the size that we had drawn it .PERIOD <BREAK>
instead ,COMMA when you speak ,COMMA you're actually using a form of telemetry not so different from the remote control device for your television .PERIOD <BREAK>
i think ,COMMA were he able to look at the evidence we have today ,COMMA he would understand it .PERIOD <BREAK>
let me introduce you now to the beery twins ,COMMA diagnosed with cerebral palsy at the age of two .PERIOD <BREAK>
encouraging telecommuting ?QUESTIONMARK what works ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
so there are ,COMMA of course ,COMMA two different possibilities .PERIOD <BREAK>
and we're fortunate today to have amanda kitts come and join us .PERIOD <BREAK>
i heard a great story recently -- i love telling it -- of a little girl who was in a drawing lesson .PERIOD she was six and she was at the back ,COMMA drawing ,COMMA and the teacher said this little girl hardly ever paid attention ,COMMA and in this drawing lesson she did .PERIOD <BREAK>
what did it mean to actually have a physical model that looked like this ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>

i couldn't when i was working on this .PERIOD <BREAK>
we taking your car ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
now ,COMMA what i'm going to be looking for in this test is how it protects your lips ,COMMA the texture ,COMMA right ,COMMA and maybe if you can discern any flavor or not .PERIOD <BREAK>
can you stand over here ?QUESTIONMARK this will just make it a little bit easier .PERIOD <BREAK>
and you're waiting for your girl .PERIOD <BREAK>
if we want to engage someone in the process of opening boxes to try and find pies ,COMMA we want to make sure it's neither too easy ,COMMA nor too difficult ,COMMA to find a pie .PERIOD <BREAK>
i want to say why psychology was good ,COMMA why it was not good and how it may become ,COMMA in the next <NUM> years ,COMMA good enough .PERIOD <BREAK>
some of these kids just don't plain know how good they are :COLON how smart and how much they have to say .PERIOD <BREAK>
i believe this has to be done with a new kind of user interface ,COMMA and this new kind of user interface could be done with an expenditure of about <NUM> million dollars .PERIOD <BREAK>
so here is my point :COLON under no circumstances should doodling be eradicated from a classroom or a boardroom or even the war room .PERIOD <BREAK>
but how we work on jawbone is really unique .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is actually quite meaningful to me ,COMMA because car designers tend to be a little bit low on the totem pole -- we don't do coffee table books with just one lamp inside of it -- and cars are thought so much as a product that it's a little bit difficult to get into the aesthetic side under the same sort of terminology that one would discuss art .PERIOD <BREAK>
okay .PERIOD excellent .PERIOD so we've got four here ,COMMA five ,COMMA six .PERIOD <BREAK>
i don't like beautiful buildings built for totalitarian regimes .PERIOD <BREAK>
and that's all the bush administration's leadership ,COMMA and it's all because of this bottom-up pressure and the fact that the phones haven't stopped ringing from the beginning of this crisis .PERIOD <BREAK>
he never seems to settle on any particular girl .PERIOD <BREAK>
i admitted that i'd actually had a fantasy -- kind of a dark fantasy -- of writing a letter about everything that was wrong with the world and then lighting myself on fire on the white house steps .PERIOD <BREAK>
so let me expose this lurking industry a little bit further .PERIOD <BREAK>
it cannot be because of some broadcast mechanism affecting everyone uniformly .PERIOD <BREAK>
on a good night ,COMMA i think my best ever was <NUM> miles in the right direction .PERIOD <BREAK>
i led a five-year national geographic expedition ,COMMA the sustainable seas expeditions ,COMMA using these little subs .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA this is what we came up with .PERIOD <BREAK>
that is one of the most extraordinary records in the history of modern warfare .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it's sort of evolved .PERIOD <BREAK>
five ,COMMA six ,COMMA seven ,COMMA eight folds we make .PERIOD <BREAK>
and now this is the early era of wearable robotics .PERIOD <BREAK>
and this lady decided ,COMMA after a year of attempted treatment of that ulcer ,COMMA that she would try this new therapy that steve invented .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA it began to occur to me that maybe your biology pulls you towards some people rather than another .PERIOD <BREAK>
and people who live in cities in the developed world tend to be very prosperous ,COMMA and thus use a lot of stuff .PERIOD <BREAK>
it said that your family had made a great sacrifice in the past .PERIOD <BREAK>
well my stomach -- it was my stomach i hated .PERIOD <BREAK>
i was here ,COMMA planting my chunks ,COMMA cutting up potatoes and planting it ,COMMA and the bees were working on this tree ;SEMICOLON bumblebees ,COMMA just making this thing vibrate .PERIOD <BREAK>
and then finally ,COMMA i want to show you some responses that we recorded with the world's first deep-sea webcam ,COMMA which we had installed in monterey canyon last year .PERIOD <BREAK>
so i wasn't going to tell her about this idea ,COMMA but the next day i couldn't control myself ,COMMA i told her .PERIOD <BREAK>
you think that's not an issue going forward ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
my students often ask me ,COMMA what is sociology ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and this speed ,COMMA combined with today's high-performance micro-controllers ,COMMA allows us to actually simulate ,COMMA in this piece ,COMMA over <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> leds -- using just <NUM> .PERIOD <BREAK>
so we've been studying the babies using a technique that we're using all over the world and the sounds of all languages .PERIOD <BREAK>
in fact ,COMMA it was the highest-operating mine in nevada ,COMMA and it ran year round .PERIOD <BREAK>
now ,COMMA what causes this ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and they grow to be about this size .PERIOD <BREAK>
they were the actors of this global market ,COMMA which i mentioned in the beginning .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i now find that bedtime stories used to be a box on my to-do list ,COMMA something that i dreaded ,COMMA because it was so slow and i had to get through it quickly .PERIOD <BREAK>
i'm going to abandon them now and walk back outside .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's been hypothesized that orb-weaving spiders ,COMMA like this argiope here ,COMMA should have the toughest dragline silks because they must intercept flying prey .PERIOD <BREAK>
good .PERIOD <BREAK>
and we have to duke it out every day ,COMMA so we resort to politics .PERIOD <BREAK>
the different frequencies produce the different particles .PERIOD <BREAK>
that's najmuddin ,COMMA the one with the white coat .PERIOD <BREAK>
or is it an imitation of one half the set of sounds we make to express disappointment ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
we have already gone far beyond the limits of human endurance .PERIOD <BREAK>
so i let them -- just they had to be neat and clean .PERIOD <BREAK>
well ,COMMA that's kind of an obvious statement up there .PERIOD <BREAK>
okay ,COMMA i'm going to sort you out .PERIOD <BREAK>
and if we look where the income ends up -- the income -- this is <NUM> percent the world's annual income .PERIOD and the richest <NUM> percent ,COMMA they take out of that about <NUM> percent .PERIOD and the poorest <NUM> percent ,COMMA they take about two percent .PERIOD and this shows that the concept of developing countries is extremely doubtful .PERIOD we think about aid ,COMMA like these people here giving aid to these people here .PERIOD but in the middle ,COMMA we have most the world population ,COMMA and they have now <NUM> percent of the income .PERIOD <BREAK>
so it's not in our nature to pre-act .PERIOD <BREAK>
and on the macro level ,COMMA we're in what seems to be a <NUM> -month presidential campaign ,COMMA and of all the things we're asking all of these potential leaders ,COMMA what about asking for the health of our children ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
robot :COLON oh ,COMMA cool .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's true .PERIOD because there's a soul in this whole thing .PERIOD <BREAK>
so we kept on going ,COMMA and this camel kept on trying to take a chunk out of my leg .PERIOD <BREAK>
and third is that physical things are readable on a map -- so restaurants ,COMMA a variety of venues ,COMMA but also with gps and other technology like rfid and it continues to expand beyond that ,COMMA we can also track things that are moving ,COMMA like a car ,COMMA a taxicab ,COMMA a transit system ,COMMA a box that's moving through time and space .PERIOD <BREAK>
the robots can be used for transporting cargo .PERIOD <BREAK>
they're not even autonomous .PERIOD <BREAK>
now notice ,COMMA he nodded there ,COMMA he was giving me some indication he was understanding the flow of communication .PERIOD <BREAK>
we want a temporary use permit for the clock ,COMMA eventually -- <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> -year temporary use permit .PERIOD <BREAK>
see ,COMMA that skylight goes down and becomes that one .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the price of electric miles ends up being a very interesting number .PERIOD <BREAK>
and in particular ,COMMA the people who made this expensive solution were very upset because they thought ,COMMA how can we hope to compete with something that's essentially free ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
because the idea was so simple ,COMMA and yet it explains all design in the universe .PERIOD <BREAK>
you go for a walk in the footsteps of abraham .PERIOD <BREAK>
and we encourage anybody to join this effort .PERIOD <BREAK>
so how do we do this ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
they put all their heads together and they decided that there was nothing that could be done for this surgeon who had essentially separated himself from the world ,COMMA who by that time had become so overwhelmed ,COMMA not just with depression and feelings of worthlessness and inadequacy ,COMMA but with obsessional thinking ,COMMA obsessional thinking about coincidences .PERIOD <BREAK>
we need a different machine .PERIOD <BREAK>
that was another thing that really touched me .PERIOD <BREAK>
this single story of africa ultimately comes ,COMMA i think ,COMMA from western literature .PERIOD <BREAK>
comic books .PERIOD quantum physics video games .PERIOD <BREAK>
and cavitation is an extremely potent fluid dynamic phenomenon which occurs when you have areas of water moving at extremely different speeds .PERIOD <BREAK>
this was not the first synthetic virus -- a polio virus had been made a year before -- but it was only one ten-thousandth as active and it took three years to do .PERIOD <BREAK>
masters and johnson :COLON now we're moving forward to the <NUM> s .PERIOD <BREAK>
to be new at ted -- it's like being the last high-school virgin .PERIOD <BREAK>
all right ,COMMA so i got a collection of the paintings together and i looked at them and i deconstructed them and i put them back together .PERIOD <BREAK>
so i turned to the teeming small creatures that can be held between the thumb and forefinger :COLON the little things that compose the foundation of our ecosystems ,COMMA the little things ,COMMA as i like to say ,COMMA who run the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
and these are two projections from the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
that ,COMMA under all circumstances ,COMMA they have pushed the boundary .PERIOD <BREAK>
i wish we had more time together ,COMMA but that's for another time .PERIOD okay ?QUESTIONMARK great .PERIOD <BREAK>
it was always part of how they looked at the world .PERIOD and that's what's really powerful .PERIOD <BREAK>
three years of dirty energy with not many jobs ,COMMA or centuries of clean energy with the potential for developing expertise and improvements in efficiency based on technical skills ,COMMA and developing local knowledge about how to get the most out of that region's wind .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i took these two men and did what i call an indirect negotiation .PERIOD <BREAK>
i did quite a lot of research .PERIOD <BREAK>
that signal goes to the web ,COMMA the cloud ,COMMA and then it can be processed and sent anywhere :COLON to a caregiver ,COMMA to a physician ,COMMA back to the patient ,COMMA etc .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA the goal is not to go to pork rinds and bacon and sausages -- these are not health foods -- but to go from bad carbs to what are called good carbs .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA although that would be really ,COMMA really awesome ,COMMA again ,COMMA that's extremely ,COMMA extremely impractical .PERIOD <BREAK>
we call this like a personal fudge factor .PERIOD <BREAK>
we won the competition ,COMMA and it was painful to get there .PERIOD <BREAK>
we have to develop a new way of managing the planet ,COMMA collectively ,COMMA through collective wisdom .PERIOD <BREAK>
after two weeks ,COMMA three weeks ,COMMA four weeks ,COMMA five weeks .PERIOD <BREAK>
we can't stop learning at age <NUM> .PERIOD <BREAK>

for me ,COMMA my mother was preparing [me] when i was a child to become a doctor ,COMMA but i really didn't want to .PERIOD <BREAK>
when palestinian and israeli politicians talk ,COMMA they usually don't listen to each other ,COMMA but a palestinian reader still reads a novel by a jewish author ,COMMA and vice versa ,COMMA connecting and empathizing with the narrator .PERIOD <BREAK>
and that's when you started to get seven different kinds of vinegar ,COMMA and <NUM> different kinds of mustard ,COMMA and <NUM> different kinds of olive oil -- and then eventually even ragu hired howard ,COMMA and howard did the exact same thing for ragu that he did for prego .PERIOD <BREAK>
i came across a student who's absolutely excellent at expressing himself ,COMMA and this student agreed that he would not show his video to anybody until you here at ted had seen it .PERIOD <BREAK>

i've been involved with the u .PERIOD s .PERIOD defense department bioshield program .PERIOD <BREAK>
only seven percent of arable land in africa is irrigated ,COMMA compared to <NUM> percent in asia .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA recently ,COMMA we have realized that the ordinary matter in the universe -- and by ordinary matter ,COMMA i mean you ,COMMA me ,COMMA the planets ,COMMA the stars ,COMMA the galaxies -- the ordinary matter makes up only a few percent of the content of the universe .PERIOD <BREAK>
they went from attractiveness and happiness and wealth and self-control to generosity and forgiveness .PERIOD <BREAK>
galileo -- he had the inquisition ,COMMA so he had to be a little bit more polite -- his was ,COMMA it’s not in the middle ,COMMA you know .PERIOD <BREAK>

sometimes these might self-assemble in your gi system and be augmented in that reality .PERIOD <BREAK>
this whole idea of sharing ,COMMA the idea of constituting reality by overlapping what i say and what you say -- think of a movie .PERIOD <BREAK>
everything seems to have gone fine .PERIOD <BREAK>
he's looking for those genes as well .PERIOD <BREAK>
as a culture ,COMMA we tell ourselves lots of stories about the future ,COMMA and where we might move forward from this point .PERIOD <BREAK>
and gail and gene did the complete opposite .PERIOD <BREAK>
we're not doing that at any scale on governance .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA armed with all the wisdom of freshman year biology ,COMMA i decided i wanted to do cancer research at <NUM> .PERIOD <BREAK>
at that time ,COMMA a large amount of money had come into newcastle university to improve schooling in india .PERIOD <BREAK>
most of the noises that the engineer ,COMMA karl jansky ,COMMA investigated were fairly prosaic in origin .PERIOD <BREAK>

the leader of the chiefs said ,COMMA no ,COMMA sorry .PERIOD we can't take you .PERIOD you'll slow us down .PERIOD <BREAK>

electronic data elements are describing every aspect of the disease .PERIOD <BREAK>
this makes university administrators very nervous ,COMMA because girls don't want to go to schools that don't have boys .PERIOD <BREAK>

change is happening ,COMMA and the change that is happening is not one that is in software .PERIOD <BREAK>
those were the risks .PERIOD they were worth it .PERIOD <BREAK>
so there's good news .PERIOD <BREAK>
natural sound can do that too .PERIOD <BREAK>
they sort of say the harsh news ,COMMA that we are facing the largest transformative development since the industrialization .PERIOD <BREAK>
and since i'm realistic ,COMMA rather than grandiose ,COMMA i don't claim that the ability to control the function of the nervous system will at once unravel all its mysteries .PERIOD <BREAK>
that's how you get rationality .PERIOD <BREAK>
well ,COMMA thank you .PERIOD <BREAK>

and of course ,COMMA the third motivator ,COMMA one near and dear to my heart as an entrepreneur ,COMMA is wealth .PERIOD <BREAK>
a high entropy arrangement is one that there are many arrangements that look that way .PERIOD <BREAK>

and technology pushed composers to tremendous extremes ,COMMA using computers and synthesizers to create works of intellectually impenetrable complexity beyond the means of performers and audiences .PERIOD <BREAK>
the new me is all about making things kind of neat and fun .PERIOD <BREAK>
and korea was probably the place i found to be the worst for these kids .PERIOD <BREAK>
and here are the dynein .PERIOD they're carrying that broadcasting system .PERIOD <BREAK>
that's why we call it the internet .PERIOD <BREAK>
they are all important .PERIOD and every brand needs to have guidelines at the center .PERIOD <BREAK>
but we're also making this available both online and in public spaces ,COMMA as a way of each of us to use music and images from our lives to make our own legacy or to make a legacy of someone we love .PERIOD <BREAK>
i'm just going to mention a few of them so that you get the idea of the diversity of it ,COMMA so that you also see how much unlocked potential .PERIOD <BREAK>
they'd collected information with photos .PERIOD they'd manually build each building .PERIOD <BREAK>
there was a sort of a standstill in britain the moment of her death ,COMMA and people decided to mourn her death in a sort of mass way .PERIOD <BREAK>
if there's one million americans -- and i really know this -- who are ready to make phone calls ,COMMA who are ready to be on email ,COMMA i am absolutely sure that we can actually change the course of history ,COMMA literally ,COMMA for the continent of africa .PERIOD <BREAK>
every morning ,COMMA there are <NUM> people queuing outside their offices to reclaim these characters .PERIOD <BREAK>
and even though that's still sort of creepy ,COMMA there is an upside to having your taste monitored .PERIOD <BREAK>
let's start with the first photograph nasa obtained of planet mars .PERIOD <BREAK>
not only do our children cope very well ,COMMA but they excel in it .PERIOD <BREAK>
china and india have signed up to the scientific evidence .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's a continuum of traits .PERIOD <BREAK>
so this tag actually works out the locations of shark depending on the timing and the setting of the sun ,COMMA plus water temperature and depth .PERIOD <BREAK>
i mean i could immediately tap into an immune response that was already there ,COMMA where it was not going to take five or six days to develop it -- it was going to immediately attack whatever this thing was on .PERIOD <BREAK>
second sight is whereby a mind-control expert can see through somebody else's eyes .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i felt a little bit cheated ,COMMA because the visualization -- that's a really easy thing to do .PERIOD <BREAK>
it had become trendy to speak about the obesity epidemic .PERIOD <BREAK>
just withering in her contempt .PERIOD <BREAK>
and boy ,COMMA i was scared because i thought ,COMMA you know ,COMMA we may be scooped .PERIOD <BREAK>
and why this is an amazing time to be a math teacher right now is because we have the tools to create this high-quality curriculum in our front pocket .PERIOD <BREAK>
and these are two anecdotes -- one was in cambodia ,COMMA in a village that has no electricity ,COMMA no water ,COMMA no television ,COMMA no telephone ,COMMA but has broadband internet now .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's amazing ,COMMA isn't it ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and they gave me lodging with a single mother and her daughter .PERIOD <BREAK>
about a year ago ,COMMA i asked myself a question :COLON knowing what i know ,COMMA why am i not a vegetarian ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
the only phase ,COMMA as we know it that can support humanity .PERIOD <BREAK>
not everybody wants it but they don't care .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the aquarium had a lot of big fish tanks but not a lot of invertebrate displays ,COMMA and being the spineless guy ,COMMA i thought ,COMMA well i'll just go out in the field and collect these wonderful animals i had been learning about as a student and bring them in ,COMMA and i built these elaborate sets and put them on display .PERIOD <BREAK>
and what that means is that it's not dormant -- it's actually been living and growing for half a million years .PERIOD <BREAK>
the whole cementation process takes about <NUM> hours .PERIOD <BREAK>
in mauritania ,COMMA less than three percent .PERIOD <BREAK>
now we all love to trot out these three mystic warriors as if they were born with the saint gene .PERIOD <BREAK>
just one eye ,COMMA looking at you ,COMMA and eliminating everything else about a face ,COMMA but just to consider gaze in an isolated way as a kind of ,COMMA as an element .PERIOD <BREAK>
i said ,COMMA i know a coded message when i see one .PERIOD <BREAK>
they're best described as iconic :COLON so iconic ,COMMA perhaps ,COMMA they're cliches .PERIOD <BREAK>
if i asked you to clap -- maybe i can do this .PERIOD <BREAK>
i'm going to tell you a little bit about my tedxhouston talk .PERIOD <BREAK>
and this is an example of this paradigm shift .PERIOD <BREAK>
and -- -- i actually found a whole bunch of general tso's relatives who are still in the little town .PERIOD <BREAK>
but it will also be useful for us .PERIOD <BREAK>
you eat more plants ,COMMA you eat less other stuff ,COMMA you live longer .PERIOD <BREAK>
so we can see :COLON <NUM> ,COMMA it's everywhere .PERIOD <BREAK>
we camped overnight in the trees ,COMMA in tree boats .PERIOD <BREAK>
more medals of honor were given for the indiscriminate slaughter of women and children than for any battle in world war one ,COMMA world war two ,COMMA korea ,COMMA vietnam ,COMMA iraq or afghanistan .PERIOD <BREAK>
but focus now is back on prevention .PERIOD <BREAK>
suppose i go up and i say ,COMMA i'm going to take your phone .PERIOD <BREAK>
yeah .PERIOD you are a superstar .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's the spirit inside .PERIOD <BREAK>
and instead of installing the large-scale machines used by western producers ,COMMA they used low-cost cad/cam prototyping technology .PERIOD <BREAK>
well ,COMMA you've got mail .PERIOD <BREAK>
here's a clip from a national geographic movie that came out in <NUM> .PERIOD <BREAK>
using the body -- it could be sneezing ,COMMA it could be coughing ,COMMA it could be animals -- exactly -- clapping ,COMMA whatever .PERIOD <BREAK>
so what i want to show you next is a video of <NUM> of these little robots flying in formation .PERIOD <BREAK>
orbital hotels to start with ,COMMA but workshops for the rest of us later on .PERIOD <BREAK>
yeah ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and can you see that this increase took place without life getting longer and without adding children ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
but there it is slowed down .PERIOD <BREAK>
i've never seen anything like that .PERIOD <BREAK>
now it's <NUM> .PERIOD <BREAK>
but i've got to tell you ,COMMA we young guys ,COMMA we looked up to this dude ,COMMA man .PERIOD <BREAK>
so we did some experiments where we saturated our poor patients with zillions of electrodes and then had them try to do two dozen different tasks -- from wiggling a finger to moving a whole arm to reaching for something -- and recorded this data .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA if you talk into the mike ,COMMA you'll hear some music in your headphones ;SEMICOLON if you talk in the phone ,COMMA then video would happen .PERIOD <BREAK>
and he stopped doing this .PERIOD <BREAK>
but this is just a single neuron .PERIOD <BREAK>
that's impressive .PERIOD <BREAK>
we also have a lot of engineers in those meetings ,COMMA and they don't always do their laundry as much as they should .PERIOD <BREAK>
that was one of the worst nightmares that we have seen .PERIOD <BREAK>
but afterwards she was kind enough to demonstrate on a bench outside .PERIOD <BREAK>
unlike the occupants of the universe ,COMMA the universe itself is not wasteful .PERIOD <BREAK>
there it is :COLON the things that i really believe are of important architecture .PERIOD <BREAK>
if that don't flow off the tongue ,COMMA what does ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
i call that the leviathan force .PERIOD <BREAK>
my talk is flapping birds and space telescopes .PERIOD <BREAK>
for the first time ever ,COMMA we have enough wealth concentrated in the hands of few individuals and the technology accessible that will allow us to really drive space exploration .PERIOD <BREAK>
you're arab muslim living in iraq .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA we went through our <NUM> commodities .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's like a guy inviting you around the campfire ,COMMA or somebody in a bar saying ,COMMA here ,COMMA let me tell you a story .PERIOD <BREAK>
and they were telling me that google software has gotten so advanced that ,COMMA based on your interaction with google over your lifetime ,COMMA they can actually predict what you are going to say next .PERIOD <BREAK>
the lower layer ,COMMA our gut brain ,COMMA has its own goals -- digestion defense -- and we have the higher brain with the goal of integration and generating behaviors .PERIOD <BREAK>
what they're getting at is that -- on the back of this crab -- the foodstuff here is this very strange bacteria that lives on the backs of all these animals .PERIOD <BREAK>
certainly ,COMMA there were molecules present on the early earth ,COMMA but they wouldn't have been these pure compounds that we worked with in the lab and i showed in these experiments .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i think a lot of people in africa have this different perspective ,COMMA and i think that's going to impact technology .PERIOD <BREAK>
he wanted to bring education and he wanted to bring technology ,COMMA and those are pillars of his life ,COMMA but also pillars of the mission of one laptop per child .PERIOD <BREAK>
on august <NUM> th and <NUM> th ,COMMA they took a stool sample ,COMMA and by the <NUM> th of august ,COMMA it was confirmed he had type <NUM> polio .PERIOD <BREAK>
these rabbits were bred at a government facility ,COMMA biosecurity queensland ,COMMA where they bred three bloodlines of rabbits and have infected them with a lethal disease and are monitoring their progress to see if it will effectively kill them .PERIOD <BREAK>
but i think ,COMMA actually ,COMMA the alternative is to grasp the nettle of the word atheism itself ,COMMA precisely because it is a taboo word carrying frissons of hysterical phobia .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so it transpired that a horse was killed ,COMMA a god was made sin-free ,COMMA a brahmin's ego was appeased ,COMMA a woman .PERIOD was ruined ,COMMA and a one-eyed monkey was left .PERIOD <BREAK>
i'm not sure by that time bombay was there ,COMMA or delhi was there ,COMMA or chennai was there ,COMMA or bangalore was there .PERIOD <BREAK>
they have to drill holes in the ice ,COMMA dive down into the water -- cold ,COMMA cold water -- to get hold of the instrument ,COMMA bring it up ,COMMA do any repairs and maintenance that they need to do ,COMMA put it back and get out before the ice melts .PERIOD <BREAK>
it just seems wrong to try and patent -- -- the freedom for underwater flight .PERIOD <BREAK>
craig venter chairs that event .PERIOD <BREAK>
and that gives you a great deal of pleasure ,COMMA to see them go on .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is a total kludge ,COMMA if you ask me .PERIOD <BREAK>
but ,COMMA actually ,COMMA it's suddenly come to me after years working in the business ,COMMA that what we create in advertising ,COMMA which is intangible value -- you might call it perceived value ,COMMA you might call it badge value ,COMMA subjective value ,COMMA intangible value of some kind -- gets rather a bad rap .PERIOD <BREAK>
right .PERIOD so if the eyes are shining ,COMMA you know you're doing it .PERIOD <BREAK>
and that code has been encrypted ,COMMA so let's decrypt it .PERIOD <BREAK>
how many fathers in the room ?QUESTIONMARK raise your hands .PERIOD <BREAK>
so for women ,COMMA housework prevents breast cancer ,COMMA but for men ,COMMA shopping could make you impotent .PERIOD <BREAK>
well ,COMMA it's aspirational .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is beethoven .PERIOD <BREAK>
i was that girl .PERIOD <BREAK>
a play ballet .PERIOD <BREAK>
and to get the government permissions ,COMMA you read in the paper ,COMMA you think it's easy to get into cuba everyday ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
i have a brother in-law named bobo -- which is a whole other story .PERIOD <BREAK>
so by leveraging these technologies together ,COMMA i think we'll enter a new era that i like to call stage <NUM> medicine .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the reason why they have to go underground is that ,COMMA if you did this experiment on the surface of the earth ,COMMA the same experiment would be swamped by signals that could be created by things like cosmic rays ,COMMA ambient radio activity ,COMMA even our own bodies .PERIOD you might not believe it ,COMMA but even our own bodies are radioactive enough to disturb this experiment .PERIOD <BREAK>
i felt ,COMMA when i had my photographs ,COMMA that i was holding on to something true ,COMMA regardless of agendas or politics .PERIOD <BREAK>
there's a company that provides a cell phone service you have in case you get lost in the woods .PERIOD <BREAK>
now there's probably costs to calling louder or shifting the frequency away from where you want to be ,COMMA and there's probably lost opportunities .PERIOD <BREAK>
when you ask people about belonging ,COMMA they'll tell you their most excruciating experiences of being excluded .PERIOD <BREAK>
so here you see ,COMMA this is a health facility in northern afghanistan ,COMMA and every morning it looks like this all over .PERIOD <BREAK>
but finally ,COMMA i got myself involved .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it's one that offers really interesting possibilities for organizing a whole host of activities down the road .PERIOD <BREAK>
she ,COMMA better than most ,COMMA knew the power of an image .PERIOD <BREAK>
it gives us a completely new view of human origins and what it means to be human ,COMMA all conventional theories of cultural evolution ,COMMA of the origin of humans ,COMMA and what makes us so different from other species .PERIOD <BREAK>
we have work to do .PERIOD and we can mobilize resources and political will .PERIOD but the political will has to be mobilized ,COMMA in order to mobilize the resources .PERIOD <BREAK>
you can say some of this is education .PERIOD <BREAK>
it is not my decision .PERIOD my job is to make sure that every person ,COMMA no matter what fate has assigned to you ,COMMA will have the opportunity to get the best quality health care in life .PERIOD <BREAK>
the sixth-graders look at it and they say ,COMMA no .PERIOD <BREAK>
and they are allowed to take whatever they want .PERIOD <BREAK>
and just as the tasmanian devil cancer is contagious through the spread of living cancer cells ,COMMA so is this dog cancer .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is the last part of this story ,COMMA because it’s how i got here ,COMMA because i still didn't ride in motorized vehicles .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA would little lewis have an astrolabe ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
look at the health systems in so many countries .PERIOD <BREAK>
well ,COMMA you sir ,COMMA you've got those glasses hung around your neck in that particularly fetching way .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so i said ,COMMA you know what ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
please welcome claron mcfadden .PERIOD <BREAK>
and as we watch it ,COMMA we are ashamed .PERIOD <BREAK>
but some day ,COMMA some day ,COMMA maybe it's going to work .PERIOD <BREAK>
so we liaised by satellite phone and arranged to meet up .PERIOD <BREAK>
our mother ,COMMA mexico ,COMMA is being violated before our very eyes .PERIOD <BREAK>
make these better ,COMMA because we can afford them .PERIOD <BREAK>
because i wanted him to feel like this was all being done very much above board .PERIOD <BREAK>
but identifying the actual losses to the economy is almost impossible to do unless we use copyright math .PERIOD <BREAK>
and instead of being able to get all the key leaders for a decision together in a single room and look them in the eye and build their confidence and get trust from them ,COMMA i'm now leading a force that's dispersed ,COMMA and i've got to use other techniques .PERIOD <BREAK>
but the differences between us and where we are in relation to each other now matter very much .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so we've done this actually on eight subjects now ,COMMA and we're just getting all the data together ,COMMA so hopefully we'll have something to say about it meaningfully .PERIOD <BREAK>
there's a great show on american television that you have to watch .PERIOD <BREAK>
so it's a little bit difficult from there to spin in some kind of positive conclusion .PERIOD <BREAK>
this matrix self-assembles ,COMMA growing through and around the particles ,COMMA making millions and millions of tiny fibers .PERIOD <BREAK>
let's find out what the reality is .PERIOD <BREAK>
whether it's something simple like turning on the lights with a switch ,COMMA or even as complex as programming robotics ,COMMA we have always had to give a command to a machine ,COMMA or even a series of commands ,COMMA in order for it to do something for us .PERIOD <BREAK>
it really matters if you're literate ,COMMA not just in reading and writing in english and french and german ,COMMA but in microsoft and linux and apple .PERIOD <BREAK>
the symphony :COLON isaac stern ,COMMA the concerto ,COMMA i heard it .PERIOD <BREAK>
so i asked myself :COLON do i write stuff for specific rooms ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
there is obviously einstein ,COMMA niels bohr ,COMMA de fermat's last theorem ,COMMA and i'm not sure whether that's james coburn or richard harris .PERIOD <BREAK>
and ,COMMA you know ,COMMA it's the same picture ;SEMICOLON it's basically the same person .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so here was the first soft tissue from a dinosaur .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's not even on the same plane as what you're talking about :COLON the pixels are up on the display .PERIOD <BREAK>
impossible ,COMMA you say ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
does this sound familiar ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
now ,COMMA every week ,COMMA we have the equivalent of <NUM> million disks ,COMMA which record our archival information on past ,COMMA current and future projects .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's an awesome idea .PERIOD doesn't work .PERIOD <BREAK>
and this is how it works .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the next map now shows africa's gdp in <NUM> ,COMMA around the time of independence for many african states .PERIOD <BREAK>
that gives me hope .PERIOD <BREAK>
now we're at a time when boldness is required to move forward .PERIOD <BREAK>
and most of all ,COMMA most of all ,COMMA it requires that all of us have the courage and the patience ,COMMA whether we are rich or poor ,COMMA african or non-african ,COMMA local or diaspora ,COMMA left or right ,COMMA to really start listening to each other .PERIOD <BREAK>
are there moms who've raised boys around that table ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and luckily he agreed .PERIOD and the theme ,COMMA in two years ,COMMA is going to be cute pictures of puppies .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i went to visit louise bourgeoise ,COMMA who's also still working ,COMMA and i looked at her sink ,COMMA which is really amazing ,COMMA and left .PERIOD <BREAK>
once again ,COMMA infinity is important .PERIOD <BREAK>
have nothing to say to us ,COMMA obsolete ,COMMA gone -- not so .PERIOD <BREAK>
perhaps it was like these toddler rules :COLON it's my stuff if i saw it first .PERIOD <BREAK>
you know ,COMMA post- <NUM> / <NUM> ,COMMA we were treated to the amazing phenomenon of george w .PERIOD bush saying ,COMMA islam means peace .PERIOD <BREAK>
so i have hope that in the future ,COMMA the prophetic words of george carlin will be realized ,COMMA who said ,COMMA my philosophy :COLON no pain ,COMMA no pain .PERIOD <BREAK>
it looks as if these different public services work together to create some nice little compositions .PERIOD <BREAK>
everybody knew that ,COMMA for generations .PERIOD <BREAK>
thankfully ,COMMA the flux ,COMMA in other words ,COMMA the flow of emissions from the ocean to the atmosphere and vice versa ,COMMA is more or less balanced .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's actually a scottish piece i've chosen .PERIOD <BREAK>
there's no reason why you can't have that peer-to-peer tutoring beyond that one classroom .PERIOD <BREAK>
we've seen an image of our blue planet ,COMMA our world bank .PERIOD <BREAK>
so these young men and women learned job-readiness and life skills through bee keeping and became productive citizens in the process .PERIOD <BREAK>
it means that the economy is dividing into high-skill ,COMMA high-wage jobs and low-skill ,COMMA low-wage jobs -- and that the middle ,COMMA the middle-skill jobs ,COMMA and the middle-earning jobs ,COMMA are starting to drop out of the economy .PERIOD <BREAK>
to eradicate smallpox ,COMMA we had to gather the largest united nations army in history .PERIOD <BREAK>
in kurzweilian terms i'm like the eeyore of economic growth .PERIOD <BREAK>
you can use ,COMMA actually ,COMMA scaffolds ,COMMA biomaterials -- they're like the piece of your blouse or your shirt -- but specific materials you can actually implant in patients and they will do well and help you regenerate .PERIOD <BREAK>
what does that mean ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and the third day ,COMMA it would be a shikari cap -- just like an adventurer's cap .PERIOD <BREAK>
i must say ,COMMA so fervent was my love of the old brooklyn dodgers in those days that i had to confess in my first confession two sins that related to baseball .PERIOD <BREAK>
and two months later on december <NUM> th ,COMMA orville wright powered the first airplane across a beach in north carolina .PERIOD <BREAK>
you'll see that the photographer ,COMMA of course ,COMMA was not inside the cage here ,COMMA so clearly the biologist is a little smarter than the photographer i guess .PERIOD <BREAK>
when i was a kid ,COMMA i was always ,COMMA like ,COMMA taking apart boxes and stuff .PERIOD <BREAK>
toyin alousa :COLON nollywood is the best thing that can happen to them .PERIOD <BREAK>
the genetically controlled studies have some sobering results .PERIOD <BREAK>
if you look first at the behavior of the fly on the right ,COMMA you can see that whenever it reaches the midpoint of the chamber where the two odors meet ,COMMA it marches straight through ,COMMA as it did before .PERIOD <BREAK>
and when kibaki got into power -- through a coalition of forces that were trying to clean up corruption in kenya -- they commissioned this report ,COMMA spent about two million pounds on this and an associated report .PERIOD <BREAK>
so i now would like you to [put] your seat belts on and put your hats [on] .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA you know ,COMMA it's a pretty interesting world when you start looking at the world a little bit differently .PERIOD <BREAK>
so why in god's name do you see this every time you print ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
maybe they started as stars and collapsed to two black holes -- each one <NUM> times the mass of the sun .PERIOD <BREAK>
we're not taking the bonus yet .PERIOD <BREAK>
tim worth says the economy is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the environment .PERIOD <BREAK>
less safe !EXCLAMATIONMARK <BREAK>
ok ,COMMA it's -- how about you ,COMMA what year ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
i basically see humanity a bit like those three brothers .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i didn't ask them to do nice cartoons .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i tried to -- there's a nick grimshaw building over here ,COMMA there's an oldenburg sculpture over here -- i tried to make a relationship urbanistically .PERIOD <BREAK>
it was fantastic .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so on .PERIOD <BREAK>
not excrement merely ,COMMA not merely surface and orifice going unwashed ,COMMA rediffusion of rum ,COMMA there was will in it ,COMMA and intention ,COMMA power and purpose -- a social ,COMMA ethical rage and rebellion -- despair too ,COMMA though ,COMMA grief ,COMMA loss .PERIOD <BREAK>
you formulate a recipe based upon the factors you can control ,COMMA whether it be the skills or the fertilizer or the plant choice .PERIOD <BREAK>
when you get math involved ,COMMA problems that you solve for aesthetic value only ,COMMA or to create something beautiful ,COMMA turn around and turn out to have an application in the real world .PERIOD <BREAK>
and actually there are loads of examples in nature that you could turn to for similar solutions .PERIOD <BREAK>
because if we do ,COMMA i can look forward to the conversation i'm going to have with my daughter in <NUM> years .PERIOD <BREAK>
i mean ,COMMA it must be true ,COMMA because we've had two hollywood blockbusters since that time ,COMMA and this paradigm ,COMMA from <NUM> to about <NUM> ,COMMA totally changed how we geologists thought about catastrophes .PERIOD <BREAK>
that ,COMMA ladies and gentlemen ,COMMA is a heart attack .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so we actually went in .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA the whole concept of branes in the universe ,COMMA if the universe is shaped like a dodecahedron this is a very good map of what could possibly be .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is the big question today .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA there must be underwater hot springs .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the approach ,COMMA of course ,COMMA also works in moving ,COMMA behaving animals .PERIOD <BREAK>
one is to develop a new artificial ecology ,COMMA a reef out in the harbor ,COMMA that would then protect new settlement patterns inland and the gowanus .PERIOD <BREAK>
the millennium bridge was supposed to be the pride of london -- a beautiful new footbridge erected across the thames ,COMMA first river crossing in over <NUM> years in london .PERIOD <BREAK>
your link is just as good as your link ,COMMA which is just as good as my link .PERIOD as long as we have a browser ,COMMA anyone can get to any website no matter how big a budget you have .PERIOD <BREAK>
that's the beauty of randomization .PERIOD <BREAK>
and that was the beginning of what turned out to be a beautiful relationship that involved sudhir living in the housing project on and off for <NUM> years :COLON hanging out in crack houses ,COMMA going to jail with the gang members ,COMMA having the car-windows shot out of his car ,COMMA having the police break into his apartment and steal his computer disks -- you name it .PERIOD <BREAK>
that is also very robust -- what you find in systems like earth where there are amino acids ,COMMA but there is no life .PERIOD <BREAK>
and just after this photo was taken we walked up the stairs .PERIOD <BREAK>
i can see my work as a job .PERIOD i do it for money .PERIOD <BREAK>
the most dramatic changes will be the skyscraper type of new pyramids that will take place in china and in many other countries .PERIOD <BREAK>
without it ,COMMA we literally can't interface with others .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it starts to dry very quickly .PERIOD <BREAK>
calculating machines are everywhere and will be completely everywhere in a small number of years .PERIOD <BREAK>
but the main reason i did it is that that's what happens to me when i'm forced to wear a lady gaga skanky mic .PERIOD <BREAK>
and instedd then becomes our mantra .PERIOD <BREAK>
so many books actually have been written over the years .PERIOD <BREAK>
so i start looking around for moving boxes ,COMMA figuring they just moved in ,COMMA but i don't see any .PERIOD <BREAK>
question :COLON how much faster did this group solve the problem ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
i wasn't able to keep up with the business ,COMMA and i ended up with a <NUM> -year detour .PERIOD <BREAK>
because of this ,COMMA all three brothers and their families had to vacate their home .PERIOD <BREAK>
if five percent of that population became ,COMMA quote ,COMMA middle class ,COMMA and wanted to go the way we've gone in the last hundred years at the same time that <NUM> percent of their population are moving into cities of the size and density of manhattan ,COMMA every six weeks -- it isn't sustainable environmentally ;SEMICOLON it isn't sustainable economically -- there just ain't enough oil -- and it's not sustainable politically .PERIOD <BREAK>
and ,COMMA of equal importance is ,COMMA we test ares in the earth's atmosphere ,COMMA at <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> feet ,COMMA which is comparable to the density and pressure of the atmosphere on mars where we'll fly .PERIOD <BREAK>
enjoy it while it lasts .PERIOD <BREAK>
fifteen years ago ,COMMA the average american had three good friends .PERIOD <BREAK>
and there's a wide clinical trial of this tissue now pending .PERIOD <BREAK>
but of course it's not only about motivation and giving them a lot of physical energy .PERIOD <BREAK>
a genome is really a description for all of the dna that is in a living organism .PERIOD <BREAK>
developing the mental flexibility to shift time perspectives fluidly depending on the demands of the situation ,COMMA that's what you've got to learn to do .PERIOD <BREAK>
the first is a really crazy project that we're building right now ,COMMA called death and the powers .PERIOD and it's a big opera ,COMMA one of the larger opera projects going on in the world right now .PERIOD <BREAK>
don't want it to leave me behind .PERIOD <BREAK>
and this individual himself ,COMMA this one that i'm holding up here ,COMMA actually had a bad back .PERIOD he'd probably had an injury as a child .PERIOD <BREAK>
i work at a university .PERIOD <BREAK>
he's been up to that point in <NUM> war zones so he's positioned to make better judgments ,COMMA perhaps ,COMMA than people who have never done that kind of work .PERIOD <BREAK>
one of the problems of writing ,COMMA and working ,COMMA and looking at the internet is that it's very hard to separate fashion from deep change .PERIOD <BREAK>
most of you spend <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> dollars an hour for babysitters when you have them .PERIOD <BREAK>
yet the market forces around the world have not yet thrown up a service where you can call in ,COMMA pay a fee ,COMMA and fight the demand for a bribe .PERIOD <BREAK>
the intelligence agencies wanted to arrest people .PERIOD <BREAK>
you might think these are people with master's degrees .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it was a paleontologist ,COMMA the late louis leakey ,COMMA who actually set me on the path for studying chimpanzees .PERIOD <BREAK>
don't jump to conclusions now on how to behave tonight and so on .PERIOD <BREAK>
and that's the sort of thing that it would be seeing .PERIOD <BREAK>
they just thought ,COMMA well ,COMMA we'll give a course of <NUM> .PERIOD <BREAK>
my mother came home one day with a turquoise notebook and asked me if i'd be interested in keeping a personal journal .PERIOD <BREAK>
and let me show you what happened .PERIOD <BREAK>
but since i'm advised not to do what i normally do ,COMMA i haven't told you that these apes have language .PERIOD <BREAK>
fortunately ,COMMA necessity remains the mother of invention ,COMMA and a lot of the design work that we're the most proud of with the aircraft came out of solving the unique problems of operating it on the ground -- everything from a continuously-variable transmission and liquid-based cooling system that allows us to use an aircraft engine in stop-and-go traffic ,COMMA to a custom-designed gearbox that powers either the propeller when you're flying or the wheels on the ground ,COMMA to the automated wing-folding mechanism that we'll see in a moment ,COMMA to crash safety features .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's not even clear that our very close genetic relatives ,COMMA the neanderthals ,COMMA had social learning .PERIOD <BREAK>
but this is quite good .PERIOD <BREAK>
so try and learn as best you can what that impact is and then take the first step to minimize it .PERIOD <BREAK>
the third lesson we learned is that policy matters .PERIOD it really matters .PERIOD <BREAK>
i think humor is a great way to celebrate our differences .PERIOD <BREAK>
it is moving from stage three to stage four .PERIOD <BREAK>
they're the white ,COMMA fuzzy ,COMMA elliptical things here .PERIOD <BREAK>
in the photograph ,COMMA the real subject doesn't exist so it makes you want that person more .PERIOD <BREAK>
<NUM> years ago the problem we had to solve was slavery .PERIOD <BREAK>
it was an intuitive ,COMMA strong-held belief that was wrong .PERIOD <BREAK>
i mean it's colorful ,COMMA it's fun .PERIOD <BREAK>
second life today is this <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> machines ,COMMA and it's about <NUM> million or so user-created objects where ,COMMA you know ,COMMA an object would be something like this ,COMMA possibly interactive .PERIOD <BREAK>
i draw with a simple pencil ,COMMA and at first ,COMMA the parkinson's was really upsetting ,COMMA because i couldn't get the pencil to stand still .PERIOD <BREAK>
i think that i may have believed unconsciously ,COMMA then ,COMMA that i was kind of a business hero .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i think because early on ,COMMA frankly ,COMMA my programs were just a little bit ahead of their time .PERIOD <BREAK>
these are two kids from project exploration .PERIOD <BREAK>
and that chain link is really expensive .PERIOD <BREAK>
but we needed to get a database of him doing more than that .PERIOD <BREAK>
you can see the camera on the front .PERIOD we collect multiple viewpoints ,COMMA vantage points ,COMMA angles ,COMMA textures .PERIOD we bring all that data back in .PERIOD <BREAK>
the reason i've taken this time is i've been fascinated to hear some of the reactions to this .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is the high-tech gadgetry that allows us to do what we do on these kinds of deep dives .PERIOD <BREAK>

and i was so humiliated and mortified that i immediately ran home to my mother and chastised her for ever letting me wear the hideous sweater .PERIOD <BREAK>
so one way to reconstruct that is to compare the prediction -- which is only based on your movement commands -- with the reality .PERIOD <BREAK>
but you also can't forget that each individual move you have to be able to complete .PERIOD <BREAK>
you should know ,COMMA the clitoris of the pig ,COMMA inside the vagina .PERIOD <BREAK>

there's a study some of you think you know about ,COMMA but very few people have ever read the story .PERIOD you watched the movie .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i'm happy to say that i'm now in the process of setting up this technology here in india .PERIOD <BREAK>
why do they do that ?QUESTIONMARK because it's cheaper ,COMMA because they don't pay the real environmental costs .PERIOD <BREAK>
now ,COMMA the animal mind ,COMMA and also my mind ,COMMA puts sensory-based information into categories .PERIOD <BREAK>

an old lady ,COMMA crying ,COMMA was carried out of her house and up the road by her son .PERIOD <BREAK>

some of these economies were ruled by authoritarian governments in the <NUM> s and <NUM> s and <NUM> s .PERIOD <BREAK>

so each person climbs individually .PERIOD <BREAK>
a super value ,COMMA in terms of their ability to ride in a car ,COMMA to get that dignity ,COMMA to get that safety ,COMMA looks practically impossible ,COMMA isn't it .PERIOD <BREAK>
this may be surprising ,COMMA because we can ,COMMA of course ,COMMA look at these people and quite easily say where they or their ancestors came from .PERIOD <BREAK>
four sleep in one twin bed ,COMMA and three sleep on the mud and linoleum floor .PERIOD <BREAK>
and surgeons were tradesmen ,COMMA rather than physicians .PERIOD <BREAK>

i was pre-med at the time ,COMMA and i thought i would become a surgeon because i was interested in anatomy and dissecting animals really piqued my curiosity .PERIOD <BREAK>

now ,COMMA the test of any idea -- i said it was a literary conceit -- is what does it get us ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
ok ,COMMA i'm still in poetics ,COMMA in aristotle ,COMMA and i'm thinking -- out of nowhere ,COMMA two terms come crashing into my head that i haven't heard since my classics professor in college drilled them there .PERIOD <BREAK>

in terms of the shipping noise ,COMMA the international maritime organization of the united nations has formed a group whose job is to establish guidelines for quieting ships ,COMMA to tell the industry how you could quiet ships .PERIOD <BREAK>
so we can actually see in real time that we've just blocked viruses in sweden and taiwan and russia and elsewhere .PERIOD <BREAK>

of course ,COMMA the details of policy are going to be different ,COMMA because the challenge is different .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's a story of public education and of rural communities and of what design might do to improve both .PERIOD <BREAK>

for the billions spent on reconstruction ,COMMA you can train masons for dollars on every house that they end up building over their lifetime .PERIOD <BREAK>
so this also has to be done in a decentralized way .PERIOD <BREAK>

i work for the red cross and i'm a physical therapist .PERIOD <BREAK>
they even affect the food that we eat and our governments .PERIOD <BREAK>
some of us were eating in good restaurants and learning how to cook well .PERIOD <BREAK>

i know they were close ,COMMA but not that close .PERIOD <BREAK>

dignity cannot wait for better times .PERIOD <BREAK>
and there ,COMMA i must attend these meetings ,COMMA mingling with some tiresome politicians ,COMMA trying to make me feel comfortable by telling how often they are eating the curry in georgetown .PERIOD <BREAK>

the resolution is going to achieve either of two forms :COLON either we will resolve these non-sustainable time-fuses in pleasant ways of our own choice by taking remedial action ,COMMA or else these conflicts are going to get settled in unpleasant ways not of our choice -- namely ,COMMA by war ,COMMA disease or starvation .PERIOD but what's for sure is that our non-sustainable course will get resolved in one way or another in a few decades .PERIOD in other words ,COMMA since the theme of this session is choices ,COMMA we have a choice .PERIOD does that mean that we should get pessimistic and overwhelmed ?QUESTIONMARK i draw the reverse conclusion .PERIOD <BREAK>

i think we have to recognize a couple of things here .PERIOD <BREAK>

but every single thing that makes us ,COMMA every atom in us ,COMMA has already created a myriad of different things and will go on to create a myriad of new things .PERIOD <BREAK>
they had people involved who were nobel laureates in economics ,COMMA who reported being bored .PERIOD <BREAK>
we have <NUM> units of local government .PERIOD <BREAK>
which is a little good ,COMMA but not very much good .PERIOD <BREAK>
now ,COMMA anything coming at all ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and to use our advanced technologies to pull out what is beneficial from this sea of noise ,COMMA basically .PERIOD <BREAK>
and in fact ,COMMA my friend and ideo founder ,COMMA david kelley ,COMMA who’s out there somewhere ,COMMA studied under him at stanford .PERIOD <BREAK>
if you show him real world images ,COMMA if you show others like him real world images ,COMMA they are unable to recognize most of the objects because the world to them is over-fragmented ;SEMICOLON it's made up of a collage ,COMMA a patchwork ,COMMA of regions of different colors and luminances .PERIOD <BREAK>
i have a stake in these ,COMMA so i'll have a disclaimer there .PERIOD <BREAK>
and they also say that they can give you perpetual motion machines and free energy systems .PERIOD <BREAK>
you know ,COMMA as an anthropologist ,COMMA walking is what made us human .PERIOD <BREAK>
he's the father of the ethanol revolution .PERIOD <BREAK>
she took our order ,COMMA and then went to the couple in the booth next to us ,COMMA and she lowered her voice so much i had to really strain to hear what she was saying .PERIOD <BREAK>
well that system is ,COMMA i think ,COMMA probably the system that kept us alive to this point ,COMMA given our human tendencies .PERIOD <BREAK>
and that's why it's great to have collaboration .PERIOD <BREAK>
what we're seeing now is that computers and radios are becoming so sophisticated that we're developing algorithms to let people own machines ,COMMA like wi-fi devices ,COMMA and overlay them with a sharing protocol that would allow a community like this to build its own wireless broadband network simply from the simple principle :COLON when i'm listening ,COMMA when i'm not using ,COMMA i can help you transfer your messages ;SEMICOLON and when you're not using ,COMMA you'll help me transfer yours .PERIOD <BREAK>
they eat out ,COMMA they see shows .PERIOD <BREAK>
but we'll certainly learn a lot .PERIOD <BREAK>
what is the general point ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
thanks to the internet ,COMMA we believe we can get anything we want whenever we want it ,COMMA delivered to our own doorstep .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's either for the better or for the worse ,COMMA ok .PERIOD <BREAK>
a point beyond which you don't know anything else about your ancestors ,COMMA and you enter this dark and mysterious realm we call history that we have to feel our way through with whispered guidance .PERIOD <BREAK>
now the other issue comes with ,COMMA not just the ability to tell pitches apart ,COMMA but the ability to tell sounds apart .PERIOD <BREAK>
yeah .PERIOD just like ,COMMA you know ,COMMA like the <NUM> -second version of <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> and <NUM> .PERIOD because we just -- your slides are so gorgeous ,COMMA and the ideas are so big ,COMMA i can't stand to let you go down without seeing <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> and <NUM> .PERIOD <BREAK>
not a whole lot of people doing this stuff .PERIOD <BREAK>
now that's something i fall short of on a daily basis .PERIOD <BREAK>
those tries were elaborate .PERIOD <BREAK>
there's some air conditioning left in the base ,COMMA but the skin now moves on hydraulics .PERIOD <BREAK>
it is the best place on the planet ,COMMA many say ,COMMA to study the history of climate change .PERIOD <BREAK>
he's taught them to spell his name ,COMMA which is aldo .PERIOD <BREAK>
now ,COMMA who do we have to blame ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
krispy kreme has figured this whole thing out .PERIOD <BREAK>
so these people ,COMMA you're killing a whole generation if you just give them aid .PERIOD <BREAK>
and in fact ,COMMA that's true of every ancient city .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA i looked .PERIOD democracy does have significant effects -- and unfortunately ,COMMA they're adverse .PERIOD <BREAK>
so it really makes you realize the onus on parents to have to look at this and regulate this and police this in their own lives and how astonishing that is .PERIOD <BREAK>
we then put in framing .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it's carving things down from the top ,COMMA with <NUM> percent waste left over and only <NUM> percent product .PERIOD you heat it up ;SEMICOLON you beat it with high pressures ;SEMICOLON you use chemicals .PERIOD ok .PERIOD heat ,COMMA beat and treat .PERIOD <BREAK>
i basically created a menu that allowed people to choose the amount and volume of food that they wanted to consume .PERIOD <BREAK>
we should also do climate change ,COMMA if for no other reason ,COMMA simply because it's such a big problem .PERIOD <BREAK>
i'd just like to show a clip from a most recent project .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i believe we count as a threshold in this great story .PERIOD <BREAK>
and <NUM> ,COMMA after the war ,COMMA the electronics existed to actually try and build such a machine .PERIOD <BREAK>
and one of these guys ,COMMA he must have been <NUM> ,COMMA he had <NUM> percent spike in oxytocin .PERIOD <BREAK>
you're saying you want a deal with all the different countries of the world where we're all bound together to cutting carbon emissions in a way that is to the benefit of the whole world .PERIOD <BREAK>
and then with an instrument we have on board ,COMMA a radar instrument ,COMMA we found there are lakes like the great lakes in here ,COMMA so it looks very much like earth .PERIOD <BREAK>
in <NUM> ,COMMA there was a table at the conference in seattle ,COMMA and a guy called marc andreessen was demonstrating his little browser for the world wide web .PERIOD <BREAK>
we're really good at being sweaty and smelly .PERIOD <BREAK>

people who made those stradivarius ,COMMA amati ,COMMA all those beautiful instruments .PERIOD <BREAK>
hello there .PERIOD <BREAK>
and what happened was that new york city ,COMMA to a degree ,COMMA ate my identity because people began to copy it .PERIOD <BREAK>
and according to them ,COMMA this creates an artificial lung in the filter .PERIOD <BREAK>
actually ,COMMA this is the smallest hall in size ,COMMA and it has more seats than any of these because it has double balconies .PERIOD <BREAK>
that's my mother .PERIOD i love her to bits .PERIOD <BREAK>
jennifer lin :COLON yes ,COMMA five cards .PERIOD any five cards .PERIOD <BREAK>
you can find out about the latest security incident .PERIOD <BREAK>
eventually ,COMMA i expect that the streets will probably extend through a redevelopment of the mall .PERIOD <BREAK>
not exclusive to these things ,COMMA but in addition to them ,COMMA is propagating a genuine demand for democracy on the ground .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i think that as we look at culture ,COMMA we kind of come to understand how we got to where we are .PERIOD <BREAK>
i don't know if you know this but -- maybe it's different now ,COMMA or maybe you were making a statement -- but in many hospital nurseries across the country ,COMMA until very recently anyway ,COMMA according to a book by jessica benjamin ,COMMA the signs over the little boys cribs read ,COMMA i'm a boy ,COMMA and the signs over the little girls cribs read ,COMMA it's a girl .PERIOD yeah .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so ,COMMA the problem is that it's not just one system ,COMMA it's multiple systems on multiple scales .PERIOD <BREAK>
you know ,COMMA in the middle ages ,COMMA in england ,COMMA when you met a very poor person ,COMMA that person would be described as an unfortunate -- literally ,COMMA somebody who had not been blessed by fortune ,COMMA an unfortunate .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so he goes around the room ,COMMA and then as he's leaving the diner ,COMMA he first-names almost everybody he's just met .PERIOD <BREAK>
but i would suggest that innovation without imitation is a complete waste of time .PERIOD <BREAK>
no ,COMMA agile aerial robots like this one .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so if we wanted to fly in this room or places where humans can't go ,COMMA we'd need an aircraft small enough and maneuverable enough to do so .PERIOD <BREAK>
in closing ,COMMA i'd like to say that everybody has the opportunity to make change in their own way .PERIOD <BREAK>
the ecliptic ,COMMA which is the path of the sun ,COMMA moon ,COMMA and planets correspond to an offset circle .PERIOD <BREAK>
gasoline costs are a tremendous drain on the american economy ,COMMA but they're also a drain on individual families and it's kind of terrifying to think about what happens when prices get higher .PERIOD <BREAK>
and if we're going to really ,COMMA truly become sustainable cities ,COMMA we need to think a little differently .PERIOD <BREAK>
now ,COMMA the bomb shelters at that point -- let's say you bought a prefab one -- it would be a few hundred dollars ,COMMA maybe up to <NUM> ,COMMA if you got a fancy one .PERIOD <BREAK>
another thing about compassion is that it really enhances what's called neural integration .PERIOD <BREAK>
i'm like ,COMMA get it off !EXCLAMATIONMARK don't worry about it ,COMMA you know .PERIOD <BREAK>
much more likely ,COMMA they will be two to four times richer than we are .PERIOD <BREAK>
if you look at america ,COMMA the proportion of americans with no one to talk to about important things went up from a tenth to a quarter .PERIOD <BREAK>
and there ,COMMA for the first time ,COMMA i encountered the other religious traditions :COLON judaism and islam ,COMMA the sister religions of christianity .PERIOD <BREAK>
and doctors suffer from the god complex a lot .PERIOD <BREAK>
and everyone then started writing about this .PERIOD <BREAK>
there are some of you in this room ,COMMA amazing people ,COMMA who offer all of us the mirror to our own humanity .PERIOD <BREAK>
we also used a continuity of change from a main exhibition hall to a natural history museum ,COMMA so it's all one continuous change in the massing ,COMMA but within that massing are very different kinds of spaces and forms .PERIOD <BREAK>
and a good example of this is the rio tinto ,COMMA which is in portugal .PERIOD <BREAK>
the original intention of this space ,COMMA which was unfortunately never realized ,COMMA was to use lenticular glass which allowed only a kind of perpendicular view out .PERIOD <BREAK>
but anyway ,COMMA whether they say they're right or whatever ,COMMA we have plenty of natural gas .PERIOD <BREAK>
we were wrong because we thought ,COMMA naturally enough ,COMMA in nation-state ways .PERIOD <BREAK>
we asked that to a junkie and they're like ,COMMA are you nuts ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
then we need to retool the car industry and do retraining ,COMMA and shift the convergence of the energy and ag-value chains to shift faster from hydrocarbons to carbohydrates ,COMMA and get out of our own way in other ways .PERIOD <BREAK>
when we watch pornography ,COMMA it's a little like having sex ,COMMA though probably not as good .PERIOD <BREAK>
in the pacific northwest ,COMMA there's a whole industry of moss-harvesting from old-growth forests .PERIOD <BREAK>
but there is a glamour of industry .PERIOD <BREAK>
compassion also looks like this .PERIOD <BREAK>
but only at the very top of this pyramid do these things become completely human .PERIOD <BREAK>
mom had redone the kitchen ;SEMICOLON mom was gone that day .PERIOD we had a pie tin .PERIOD <BREAK>
and all this at a time when the population has doubled .PERIOD <BREAK>
fantastic !EXCLAMATIONMARK i thought .PERIOD let's throw him out .PERIOD <BREAK>
and very often violence is a way to cope with it .PERIOD <BREAK>
you may recognize these two guys .PERIOD <BREAK>

all ages ,COMMA solo play ,COMMA body play ,COMMA games ,COMMA taunting .PERIOD <BREAK>
this robot is a very recent project .PERIOD it's called raphael .PERIOD <BREAK>
and also ,COMMA the hope is that you start to be connected to the whole greater system .PERIOD <BREAK>
and you can actually see here the printhead going through and printing this structure ,COMMA and it takes about <NUM> minutes to print this structure .PERIOD <BREAK>
these are going to be game changing .PERIOD <BREAK>
people could not gather without getting busted and taken to jail .PERIOD <BREAK>
toughness ?QUESTIONMARK well ,COMMA we was in west jordan ,COMMA utah ,COMMA and this bull shoved my face right through the metal shoots in a -- you know ,COMMA busted my face all up and had to go to the hospital .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's not the way i was brought up .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the bottom one is you lot -- super-creatives plotted in the same way .PERIOD <BREAK>
so we've seen that we can change people's faces .PERIOD <BREAK>
i'll give you a demonstration of how it works .PERIOD <BREAK>
it was pretty hard .PERIOD <BREAK>
i have an interest in education -- actually ,COMMA what i find is everybody has an interest in education .PERIOD <BREAK>
i want to understand them .PERIOD <BREAK>
they shouldn't be there .PERIOD and we called it lost city .PERIOD <BREAK>
not sure of all the details ,COMMA but excited .PERIOD <BREAK>
but sometime ago ,COMMA i discovered that if i cover my left eye ,COMMA instead what i get is this .PERIOD <BREAK>
the capability of the sun shining ,COMMA the wind blowing and the rain falling ,COMMA simply isn't enough to add up .PERIOD <BREAK>
but actually they are cruel to themselves .PERIOD <BREAK>
intimacy for us means a lot of different things .PERIOD <BREAK>
now ,COMMA i guarantee that about <NUM> percent of you ,COMMA or maybe it's fewer at ted ,COMMA will have said it comes out of the ground .PERIOD and some people ,COMMA probably two of you ,COMMA will come up and argue with me afterwards ,COMMA and say that actually ,COMMA it comes out of the ground .PERIOD <BREAK>
for example ,COMMA fascinating talks contain a statistically high amount of exactly this blue color ,COMMA much more than the average tedtalk .PERIOD <BREAK>
there's an old adage that applied for the years between <NUM> s and <NUM> s ,COMMA when every aeronautical company was working on vertical-takeoff aircraft .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's really unsatisfactory having plug-in art .PERIOD <BREAK>
in fact ,COMMA what we've found is that every single business outcome improves .PERIOD <BREAK>
the field of paleoanthropology ,COMMA i'll argue ,COMMA gives us lots of fascinating possibilities about our ancestry ,COMMA but it doesn't give us the probabilities that we really want as scientists .PERIOD <BREAK>
most people say they would .PERIOD here's a slightly different story :COLON $ <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> hawaiian vacation package is now on sale for <NUM> dollars ,COMMA so you decide to mull it over for a week .PERIOD <BREAK>

we diagnose the disease eventually ,COMMA once it becomes symptomatic ,COMMA and then we treat the symptom for <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> years .PERIOD <BREAK>

but the simple act of kindness from a complete stranger will unstitch you .PERIOD <BREAK>
audience :COLON oh ,COMMA <NUM> .PERIOD <BREAK>
not really .PERIOD i mean ,COMMA we don't have any wikileaks dissidents yet .PERIOD <BREAK>
it was black or white .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA we're going to head over to the dumpsters ,COMMA where it's traditional ,COMMA after a long day at the market ,COMMA to go out for a break ,COMMA but also stare up at the sky .PERIOD <BREAK>
so the question is ,COMMA why is that ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and because copenhagen is completely flat ,COMMA if you want to have a nice south-facing slope with a view ,COMMA you basically have to do it yourself .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA that's the step after this -- of computing as a raw material .PERIOD <BREAK>
we can zip through them as a possibility .PERIOD <BREAK>
thank you .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i'm asking ,COMMA what am i doing here ?QUESTIONMARK why am i here ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>

the infinity mushroom is a subset of decompiculture i'm calling body decompiculture and toxin remediation -- the cultivation of organisms that decompose and clean toxins in bodies .PERIOD <BREAK>

so not only do we do the veggie house ,COMMA we also do the in-vitro meat habitat ,COMMA or homes that we're doing research on now in brooklyn ,COMMA where ,COMMA as an architecture office ,COMMA we're for the first of its kind to put in a molecular cell biology lab and start experimenting with regenerative medicine and tissue engineering and start thinking about what the future would be if architecture and biology became one .PERIOD <BREAK>

this is hogwart's from the movie harry potter and that's harvard .PERIOD <BREAK>

because i have to exchange your father's underwear .PERIOD <BREAK>
maybe you will cut ?QUESTIONMARK lift .PERIOD <BREAK>
they have higher blood pressure ,COMMA poorer cholesterol profiles and reduced glucose tolerance -- a precursor of diabetes .PERIOD <BREAK>
and then there is self-similarity across the scales -- in other words ,COMMA from one skin of the onion to another one .PERIOD <BREAK>
one of our major inventions that we need to be able to do to come even close to what these organisms can do is to find a way to minimize the amount of material ,COMMA the kind of material we use ,COMMA and to add design to it .PERIOD <BREAK>
i won't be able to tell you what it is until it happens .PERIOD <BREAK>
what you see over here ,COMMA this yellow thing ,COMMA this is not a death ray .PERIOD <BREAK>

they control <NUM> percent of the commercially produced seeds in our country .PERIOD <BREAK>

and shelter and place .PERIOD you want to move downwind or crosswind for <NUM> .PERIOD <NUM> miles .PERIOD <BREAK>
these are spores -- this is in their spores .PERIOD <BREAK>
and in addition ,COMMA we've actually used polarizers on all the lights -- just like polarized sunglasses can block the glare off of the road ,COMMA polarizers can block the shine off of the skin ,COMMA so we don't get all those specular reflections to take this map .PERIOD <BREAK>
now imagine what happens where -- we talked about the peers teaching each other inside of a classroom .PERIOD <BREAK>
the question is ,COMMA what do you do with the power ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
but by then cattle were already raised unnaturally .PERIOD <BREAK>
i mean ,COMMA you know ,COMMA the emergency bunker was right there ,COMMA was destroyed by the attacks ,COMMA and obviously the damage done to the building and the lives .PERIOD <BREAK>
we've made a donation on everybody's behalf here to kick start ,COMMA no pun intended ,COMMA their next project .PERIOD <BREAK>

we have reason to be afraid that we haven't secured loose nuclear material in the former soviet union .PERIOD <BREAK>

it's like a dormant command that suddenly is activated in you ,COMMA like a call to devil's tower .PERIOD <BREAK>
even though there are default situations in which one of these mindsets can be applied ,COMMA they can be stretched and extended .PERIOD <BREAK>

has anybody here seen that film ?QUESTIONMARK yeah .PERIOD <BREAK>
thank god we are empathetic .PERIOD <BREAK>
and of course ,COMMA we all will be deeply disappointed when we do .PERIOD <BREAK>
there's a lot of research and a lot of failure ,COMMA trial and error -- i guess ,COMMA more error -- that goes into each and every dish ,COMMA so we don't always get it right ,COMMA and it takes a while for us to be able to explain that to people .PERIOD <BREAK>
we're looking at building whole cities in their planning department .PERIOD <BREAK>

the dominant things that exist here we know almost nothing about .PERIOD <BREAK>

leroy has nine tickets ;SEMICOLON there's one left .PERIOD <BREAK>

<NUM> percent of the coral may be wiped out before <NUM> because of global warming .PERIOD <BREAK>

average happiness is ,COMMA of course ,COMMA inadequate ,COMMA because it doesn't speak to the moment-by-moment experience ,COMMA and so this is what we think it looks like when you layer in moment-to-moment experience .PERIOD <BREAK>

we need to also retrofit the corridors themselves .PERIOD <BREAK>

the worst part was that she had allodynia ,COMMA the medical term for the phenomenon that i just illustrated with the feather and with the torch .PERIOD <BREAK>
these are the solutions that we need to find .PERIOD <BREAK>
all they have ,COMMA really ,COMMA is trademark protection ,COMMA and so it means that anybody could copy any garment on any person in this room and sell it as their own design .PERIOD <BREAK>
they get fit together ,COMMA and then they compete .PERIOD <BREAK>

from kansas ,COMMA i moved on to lovely arizona ,COMMA where i taught in flagstaff for a number of years ,COMMA this time with middle school students .PERIOD <BREAK>
the average boy now watches <NUM> porn video clips a week .PERIOD <BREAK>

so ,COMMA i form friendships and co-worker and sibling and relative relationships with other people who in turn have similar relationships with other people .PERIOD <BREAK>
and we thought ,COMMA rather than doing a traditional stack of apartments looking straight into a big boring block of cars ,COMMA why don't we turn all the apartments into penthouses ,COMMA put them on a podium of cars .PERIOD <BREAK>
you know ,COMMA i've realized that wolfram alpha actually gives one a whole new kind of computing that one can call knowledge-based computing ,COMMA in which one's starting not just from raw computation ,COMMA but from a vast amount of built-in knowledge .PERIOD <BREAK>
the fact that there's one weird red dot that's up above the curve ,COMMA there's one weirdo in the room -- i know who you are ,COMMA i saw you earlier -- that's no problem .PERIOD <BREAK>

hosts work hard to spread these ideas to others .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's nice poetry ,COMMA but that can't exactly be right .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is a really easy problem .PERIOD <BREAK>
ultimately ,COMMA especially now in this world ,COMMA where we live in a context of regressive and onerous immigration laws ,COMMA in reality tv that thrives on humiliation ,COMMA and in a context of analysis ,COMMA where the thing we hear most repeatedly ,COMMA day-in ,COMMA day-out in the united states ,COMMA in every train station ,COMMA every bus station ,COMMA every plane station is ,COMMA ladies and gentlemen ,COMMA please report any suspicious behavior or suspicious individuals to the authorities nearest you ,COMMA when all of these ways we are encouraged to view our fellow human being with hostility and fear and contempt and suspicion .PERIOD <BREAK>

by the time i did bloomberg's headquarters my work had begun to become accepted .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is a piece that every two or three minutes scans the world's newly-posted blog entries for occurrences of the phrases i feel or i am feeling .PERIOD <BREAK>
and she starts thinking about having a child ,COMMA and from the moment she starts thinking about having a child ,COMMA she starts thinking about making room for that child .PERIOD <BREAK>
its origins are firmly rooted in the analog age .PERIOD <BREAK>
before i discovered the wonders of science ,COMMA i was just a simple farmer in a country of poor farmers .PERIOD <BREAK>
so we looked at a few more conflicts .PERIOD <BREAK>
sixties ,COMMA seventies ,COMMA eighties and nineties .PERIOD <BREAK>
they don't feel as if they're doing something that really matters to them ,COMMA so they pick up these kinds of activities .PERIOD <BREAK>
and ,COMMA likewise ,COMMA we infected them with parainfluenza- <NUM> -- that's a paramyxovirus -- and you see a little barcode here .PERIOD <BREAK>

now ,COMMA many of you know that the patriot act is a legislation that greatly reduces the liberties of americans in order to protect them against terrorism .PERIOD <BREAK>
so we have a biology of trustworthiness .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it wanders far and wide .PERIOD we know that much about it .PERIOD <BREAK>
where j&amp ;SEMICOLON j basically is tapping into the power of mommy bloggers ,COMMA allowing them to basically create a forum where they can communicate and they can connect .PERIOD <BREAK>
there is more energy flowing through ,COMMA per gram per second ,COMMA than anything that we have any other experience with .PERIOD <BREAK>

a little seed weighs a lot and ,COMMA basically ,COMMA all this stuff ,COMMA <NUM> percent of this stuff ,COMMA came out of the air .PERIOD <BREAK>
'no ,COMMA ' i answer .PERIOD 'conjuring tricks ,COMMA not real magic .PERIOD ' 'real magic ,COMMA ' in other words ,COMMA refers to the magic that is not real ;SEMICOLON while the magic that is real ,COMMA that can actually be done ,COMMA is not real magic .PERIOD <BREAK>

nice to meet you .PERIOD <BREAK>
let me give it a little weapon on the tail here ,COMMA so it can fight .PERIOD <BREAK>

we changed our logo ,COMMA for the day ,COMMA from the alien to a splashy ,COMMA to sort of help the cause .PERIOD <BREAK>
these are the distances of the tubes which make it walk that way .PERIOD <BREAK>
the doctors and nurses were phenomenal .PERIOD <BREAK>

the u .PERIOD s .PERIOD accounted for <NUM> percent of total news coverage .PERIOD <BREAK>
it said ,COMMA you know ,COMMA this is a car that has lots of faults .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so where there is water ,COMMA there is a very high chance of our kind of life .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i call that their agenda .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA we moved from an industrial economy to a service-based economy .PERIOD <BREAK>
the lesson i want to leave you with from these data is that our longings and our worries are both to some degree overblown ,COMMA because we have within us the capacity to manufacture the very commodity we are constantly chasing when we choose experience .PERIOD <BREAK>
also ,COMMA the system is self-fueling .PERIOD <BREAK>
he must see himself and the world through the eyes of another ,COMMA and of many others .PERIOD <BREAK>
but teach them how to fix the price ,COMMA guess the price ,COMMA pull up the photos .PERIOD <BREAK>
how aware are you of things going on around the world ,COMMA the seasons changing ,COMMA people around you ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>

susan boyle .PERIOD <BREAK>
well if you think it's going to last <NUM> months ,COMMA are you going to buy <NUM> months worth of masks for every single person in your family ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and as a result it's a very tolerant community ,COMMA which is different ,COMMA i think ,COMMA than something like this ,COMMA which is in schaumburg ,COMMA illinois ,COMMA where every little set of houses has their own cul-de-sac and drive-through starbucks and stuff like that .PERIOD <BREAK>
the length is smaller by eight percent by the way .PERIOD <BREAK>
because we have to figure out what to do with all these animals .PERIOD <BREAK>
now this had all sorts of invidious social consequences .PERIOD <BREAK>
what i thought i would talk about today is the transition from one mode of thinking about nature to another that's tracked by architecture .PERIOD <BREAK>
so i thought i would just like to show you some of the pictures i've taken of some of my mentors .PERIOD <BREAK>
he wants to clunk me over the head !EXCLAMATIONMARK <BREAK>
the place that you see here on the left side was interconnected .PERIOD it was based on this diversity .PERIOD <BREAK>
thank you .PERIOD it's really an honor and a privilege to be here spending my last day as a teenager .PERIOD <BREAK>
it became an alternate existence ,COMMA my virtual reality .PERIOD <BREAK>
there were pigeons roosting in the dish .PERIOD <BREAK>
we make a decision it's that big ,COMMA even though it's not that big .PERIOD <BREAK>
same is true for organ failure ,COMMA when you have loss of function owing to poor perfusion of kidney ,COMMA of liver ,COMMA acute respiratory distress syndrome and damage suffered in cardiac-bypass surgery .PERIOD <BREAK>
but they're also mapping things of ecological interest ,COMMA also military interest :COLON the hills ,COMMA the marshes ,COMMA the streams .PERIOD <BREAK>
and we're now going to put some chemistry inside and do some chemistry in this cell .PERIOD <BREAK>
so what you're seeing here is the one letter abbreviation for amino acids ,COMMA and i've colored in the glycines with green ,COMMA and the alanines in red ,COMMA and so you can see it's just a lot of g's and a's .PERIOD <BREAK>
war is simply no longer the best option ,COMMA and that is why violence has decreased .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's like a wireless accelerometer ,COMMA pedometer .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so where it all goes ,COMMA i don't know .PERIOD <BREAK>
your childhood certainly plays a role ,COMMA but nobody knows how .PERIOD <BREAK>
losing of labels ,COMMA because we are not jam jars .PERIOD <BREAK>
symmetry is very important in this discussion .PERIOD <BREAK>
three of the original eight entities were suing each other .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i've been going to the rodeos with him ,COMMA and we've bonded .PERIOD <BREAK>
and that was something that i went through ,COMMA you know ,COMMA and i'm still going through .PERIOD <BREAK>
it was getting more and more apparent that we're fighting a losing battle .PERIOD <BREAK>
i wanted to put heart and soul and people ,COMMA your public ,COMMA around the statistics that we've become so used to .PERIOD <BREAK>
and bateson invented the concept of symmetry breaking ,COMMA which is that wherever you lose information in a system ,COMMA you revert back to symmetry .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA all of that is in the creation of content ,COMMA of relevance ,COMMA basic human expression .PERIOD <BREAK>
eve ensler :COLON you know ,COMMA i think carl jung once said that in order to survive the twentieth century ,COMMA we have to live with two existing thoughts ,COMMA opposite thoughts ,COMMA at the same time .PERIOD <BREAK>

they do it on their own tapes ,COMMA with their own recording equipment ;SEMICOLON they distribute it themselves .PERIOD <BREAK>
i always begin with the pulse ,COMMA then i examine the hands ,COMMA then i look at the nail beds ,COMMA then i slide my hand up to the epitrochlear node ,COMMA and i was into my ritual .PERIOD <BREAK>
we need to be doing that .PERIOD <BREAK>
china ,COMMA all grown up ,COMMA going to be a looker !EXCLAMATIONMARK <BREAK>
i've been wondering for a long time ,COMMA since i've been thinking about memes a lot ,COMMA is there a difference between the memes that we copy -- the words we speak to each other ,COMMA the gestures we copy ,COMMA the human things -- and all these technological things around us ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>

there's an influential taxonomy by the anthropologist alan fiske ,COMMA in which relationships can be categorized ,COMMA more or less ,COMMA into communality ,COMMA which works on the principle what's mine is thine ,COMMA what's thine is mine ,COMMA the kind of mindset that operates within a family ,COMMA for example ;SEMICOLON dominance ,COMMA whose principle is don't mess with me ;SEMICOLON reciprocity ,COMMA you scratch my back ,COMMA i'll scratch yours ;SEMICOLON and sexuality ,COMMA in the immortal words of cole porter ,COMMA let's do it .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so ,COMMA the games that i do ,COMMA i think of really more as modern montessori toys .PERIOD <BREAK>

so ,COMMA i said ,COMMA no ,COMMA no ,COMMA really -- it's penguin shit .PERIOD <BREAK>
on the far left ,COMMA you see the purple line .PERIOD <BREAK>
and we're not all going to become facial expression experts overnight here ,COMMA but there's one i can teach you that's very dangerous ,COMMA and it's easy to learn ,COMMA and that's the expression of contempt .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is from britain's leading diet and nutritionist in the daily mirror ,COMMA which is our second biggest selling newspaper .PERIOD <BREAK>

exploring the feminine ,COMMA nurturing side of divinity .PERIOD <BREAK>
we can now actually interfere with their psychology in rather profound ways ,COMMA as i'll show you in my last example ,COMMA which is directed at a familiar question .PERIOD <BREAK>

if the sun could one day -- and indeed the earth ,COMMA in fact -- if the earth could read its own astrological ,COMMA astronomical chart ,COMMA one day it would say ,COMMA not a good day for making plans .PERIOD <BREAK>
and then there is social media ,COMMA and what's happening on the internet .PERIOD <BREAK>
it would give everyday citizens a chance to play a role in the protection of the planet .PERIOD <BREAK>
my grandmother was on a train to auschwitz ,COMMA the death camp .PERIOD <BREAK>
it gets up to about <NUM> feet long .PERIOD <BREAK>
so you've effectively negated <NUM> years of aeronautic research .PERIOD <BREAK>

every difference that there is between the past and the future is because entropy is increasing -- the fact that you can remember the past ,COMMA but not the future .PERIOD <BREAK>

but much worse than that ,COMMA <NUM> percent said they thought there'd be a pandemic within your children or your grandchildren's lifetime .PERIOD <BREAK>

you can take cuttings ;SEMICOLON they can sort of have sex with themselves ;SEMICOLON they can pollinate themselves .PERIOD <BREAK>
so taking on morality with a capital m is a huge project .PERIOD <BREAK>
and what's interesting about it isn't the cost ;SEMICOLON it's the way it encodes the internet .PERIOD <BREAK>
i'm going to show you a little bit of that long ,COMMA extended process .PERIOD <BREAK>
how can we tell the difference between possibility one and possibility two ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>

your issues as it relates to this science ,COMMA is how to maintain your own high-functioning learning machine .PERIOD <BREAK>

as he correctly guessed ,COMMA some of these sounds were caused by activity on the surface of the sun .PERIOD <BREAK>

it didn't work .PERIOD <BREAK>
these cells ,COMMA called glial cells ,COMMA were once thought to be unimportant structural elements of the spinal cord that did nothing more than hold all the important things together ,COMMA like the nerves .PERIOD <BREAK>
achilles was a man who could shape history ,COMMA a man of destiny ,COMMA and this is what you should be ,COMMA alexander .PERIOD <BREAK>
by measuring it ,COMMA the act of measurement changes it .PERIOD <BREAK>
in us ,COMMA all the senses are distinct .PERIOD <BREAK>

now ,COMMA the crucial thing to notice here is that this is a factual claim :COLON this is something that we could be right or wrong about .PERIOD and if we have misconstrued the relationship between biological complexity and the possibilities of experience well then we could be wrong about the inner lives of insects .PERIOD <BREAK>
one of them is just obtaining trust from individuals that we work with in the field .PERIOD <BREAK>
they were brilliant people .PERIOD i'm not dissing the neanderthals .PERIOD <BREAK>
and because god loves her ,COMMA i did get married .PERIOD <BREAK>
meteorites delivered chemistry ,COMMA and perhaps membranes ,COMMA too .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA anything that has been made can be unmade .PERIOD <BREAK>
they gave up the ability to make stone tools and fishing equipment and clothing because the population of about <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> people was simply not large enough to maintain the specialized skills necessary to keep the technology they had .PERIOD <BREAK>
by mid-century ,COMMA we're going to have about eight billion -- perhaps more -- people living in cities or within a day's travel of one .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA now we can compute that the output arranges material as well as information .PERIOD and ,COMMA ultimately ,COMMA these are some slides from an early project i did ,COMMA computing where the bits are stored quantum-mechanically in the nuclei of atoms ,COMMA so programs rearrange the nuclear structure of molecules .PERIOD <BREAK>
or this -- this is a really neat teapot i found at high tea at the four seasons hotel in chicago .PERIOD <BREAK>

it leaves little room for interdependence or an acknowledgment of individual fallibility .PERIOD <BREAK>
they thought some people didn't like them .PERIOD <BREAK>
look here you have china over there ,COMMA you have india over there ,COMMA and this is what has happened .PERIOD <BREAK>
and while a student at hawaii ,COMMA i worked at the waikiki aquarium .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's bamboo .PERIOD <BREAK>
but there's one big puzzle remaining ,COMMA and this was most succinctly put to me by my primary school math teacher in tanzania ,COMMA who's a wonderful scottish lady who i still stay in touch with .PERIOD <BREAK>
so the temperature has been ,COMMA sort of ,COMMA inching up .PERIOD <BREAK>
now just trying putting a few grains of sand between your teeth and see the difference it makes .PERIOD <BREAK>
and that's what i think the world needs now .PERIOD thank you .PERIOD <BREAK>
so somebody says ,COMMA delete it ,COMMA please .PERIOD delete it -- it's not notable .PERIOD <BREAK>
and as dan dennett puts it ,COMMA if you have those ,COMMA then you must get evolution .PERIOD <BREAK>
it can be for <NUM> or <NUM> minutes .PERIOD we call that resting or benching .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is where i realized that there was really a need to communicate ,COMMA because the data of what's happening in the world and the child health of every country is very well aware .PERIOD <BREAK>
anyone can kill me ,COMMA or you ,COMMA or you .PERIOD <BREAK>
now this ,COMMA for me ,COMMA is a common situation .PERIOD <BREAK>

and so let me show you now the footage of the bridge .PERIOD <BREAK>
there is a dip there ,COMMA from <NUM> to <NUM> :COLON a dip when our sales ,COMMA over a three-year period ,COMMA were down <NUM> percent .PERIOD <BREAK>

and parallel universes ?QUESTIONMARK again :COLON dots there ,COMMA rather than there ,COMMA on a screen .PERIOD <BREAK>
now ,COMMA this situation changed ,COMMA of course ,COMMA after <NUM> - <NUM> ,COMMA because george bush launched the war on terror .PERIOD <BREAK>
but he was ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA a moral philosopher ,COMMA and he was right on why we're moral .PERIOD <BREAK>
the second problem that comes with headphone abuse is compression .PERIOD <BREAK>
i mean ,COMMA those people lose their independence .PERIOD <BREAK>
once you start down at this very humble level ,COMMA then you can start finding ways to see things .PERIOD <BREAK>
so already you can see there are contradictions .PERIOD <BREAK>

people are staying away from elite art and criticism .PERIOD <BREAK>

there were trawls taken in the deep sea in the mediterranean ,COMMA which collected more garbage than they did animals .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i meet a lot of people who are very successful ,COMMA who say ,COMMA why don't i feel more fulfilled ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>

as i said ,COMMA this agent is in us ,COMMA and ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA here's a curious thing ,COMMA it binds to the very place inside of your cells where oxygen binds ,COMMA and where you burn it ,COMMA and that you do this burning to live .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the mantra was :COLON shoot first ;SEMICOLON ask questions later .PERIOD <BREAK>
the fact that they have stuck here with this kind of performance has been ,COMMA well ,COMMA you know ,COMMA you win the war in <NUM> minutes ;SEMICOLON why do you need something better ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and that calculation isn't much in dispute .PERIOD <BREAK>
one of my favorites .PERIOD i had this feature that i built into second life -- i was really passionate about it .PERIOD <BREAK>
but he told ted that on the last day he went out ,COMMA a bottlenose dolphin suddenly appeared next to the boat ,COMMA and it was splattering oil out its blowhole .PERIOD <BREAK>
and think about the economic value they have provided by that experience .PERIOD <BREAK>

the implication of that is that the wave function has to go to zero ,COMMA it has to vanish when the helium atoms touch each other .PERIOD <BREAK>
that's a little thing that lives inside an elephant .PERIOD <BREAK>
and charles ii ,COMMA the son ,COMMA was finally put back on the throne of england .PERIOD <BREAK>
so i should say ,COMMA i guess ,COMMA that since the time of that original president johnson report ,COMMA and the various reports of the u .PERIOD s .PERIOD national academy -- <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> -- people always talked about this idea .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the idea is you fast forward and good students start failing algebra all of a sudden and start failing calculus all of a sudden ,COMMA despite being smart ,COMMA despite having good teachers ,COMMA and it's usually because they have these swiss cheese gaps that kept building throughout their foundation .PERIOD <BREAK>
there are these terrifyingly huge indian trucks that come careening around one-lane roads with two-lane traffic ,COMMA with <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> -foot drop-offs right next to the road ,COMMA and he was driving one of these trucks .PERIOD <BREAK>
if you put particles in them ,COMMA and they go shooting out the tip -- they're like miniature linear accelerators or electron guns .PERIOD <BREAK>

he began to come twice a week to my center because women could not go to the mosque .PERIOD <BREAK>
the bad news is this doesn't bring us universal compassion by itself .PERIOD <BREAK>

britain ,COMMA america ,COMMA japan ,COMMA south africa ,COMMA the congo .PERIOD <BREAK>
i wrote a book about eight incredible people all over this country doing social justice work .PERIOD <BREAK>
we're running out of fresh water .PERIOD <BREAK>

they apply to this fund in order to do various projects ,COMMA and i'll show you a couple of examples .PERIOD <BREAK>
so what happens ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>

and i started across the hall in north carolina ,COMMA because i thought it was probably a canaletto ,COMMA and would have all that in detail .PERIOD <BREAK>
for the first time in history ,COMMA more people live in urban ,COMMA rather than rural ,COMMA environments .PERIOD <BREAK>
she's totally not kidding .PERIOD <BREAK>
the other said ,COMMA how much did we hire him for ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
burn is the idea of trying to create the physical instantiation of one of these courses .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA this is the message of desert .PERIOD <BREAK>
now ,COMMA what's missing from the larger debate is a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis between not fixing an unhealthy ,COMMA environmentally challenged community ,COMMA versus incorporating structural ,COMMA sustainable changes .PERIOD <BREAK>
and priam looks at the man who has murdered so many of his sons ,COMMA and he ,COMMA too ,COMMA starts to weep .PERIOD and the sound of their weeping filled the house .PERIOD <BREAK>
my story of nigeria growing up was very different from the story i encountered in prison ,COMMA and i had no language for it .PERIOD <BREAK>
it was just saying random english phonemes .PERIOD <BREAK>
they work in the field .PERIOD <BREAK>
so in effect ,COMMA you are like odysseus and the first mate in one person .PERIOD <BREAK>
we would see where we were going ,COMMA we would see the first indication of what could be the successive phenomenon to the suv in america .PERIOD <BREAK>
as healthcare improves ,COMMA as infant mortality goes down ,COMMA fertility rates start dropping .PERIOD and india is experiencing that .PERIOD <BREAK>
in particular ,COMMA they were obsessed with the story of grey poupon .PERIOD right ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
it was hard to believe that what i had imagined was now built ,COMMA permanent and had lost nothing in translation .PERIOD <BREAK>
so gneezy and rustichini run this experiment for a dozen weeks -- run the fine for a dozen weeks -- and then they say ,COMMA okay ,COMMA that's it .PERIOD all done ;SEMICOLON fine .PERIOD <BREAK>
day three ,COMMA she gets a massively big pox on her shoulder .PERIOD <BREAK>
but we need your help .PERIOD <BREAK>
number one is ,COMMA they have been living essentially unchanged for the past <NUM> years .PERIOD <BREAK>
so if we don't like stuff ,COMMA or we're intensely curious about ernst haeckel's scientific falsifications ,COMMA we can pull them out like that .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so the profile is sort of for your average san francisco neighborhood :COLON a lot of young people .PERIOD <BREAK>
and if it went really well ,COMMA we might do three parabolas .PERIOD <BREAK>
you see the autopsy table ,COMMA morgue trays ,COMMA x-ray machines and even used utensils ,COMMA which you see on the autopsy table .PERIOD <BREAK>
and then another pair of legs we collaborated on were these -- look like jellyfish legs ,COMMA also polyurethane .PERIOD <BREAK>
they're not radically different from routers inside the middle of the network .PERIOD <BREAK>
and these projects will continue past these sessions ,COMMA using collaborative interactive communication .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's so basic .PERIOD it just grows wild .PERIOD <BREAK>
so darwin ,COMMA he took long walks alone in the woods and emphatically turned down dinner party invitations .PERIOD <BREAK>
and we drive away here -- we find the first garden in the street ,COMMA and they earn <NUM> to <NUM> dollars a day .PERIOD <BREAK>
i mean ,COMMA really .PERIOD <BREAK>
we pay them to leave their water in-stream .PERIOD <BREAK>
so to solve this quandary of the two force peaks :COLON what i think was going on is :COLON that first impact is actually the limb hitting the load cell ,COMMA and the second impact is actually the collapse of the cavitation bubble .PERIOD <BREAK>
so they went for plan b .PERIOD <BREAK>
but what they did ,COMMA of course ,COMMA since it was so complicated and expensive ,COMMA they only used it on the zero-year-olds and the one-year-olds .PERIOD <BREAK>
now you pursue this guy ,COMMA gesticulating .PERIOD <BREAK>
what we've done is we've created economies .PERIOD <BREAK>
the average depths are about <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> ft .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's a sensitivity to the physical environment ,COMMA the ability to pick out patterns in an environment -- derive a gist .PERIOD <BREAK>
we'd like to spend time with him .PERIOD he looks friendly .PERIOD <BREAK>

a lot of reporters come to yemen and they want to write a story on al-qaeda or terrorism .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's formless ,COMMA featureless ,COMMA depthless ,COMMA scaleless ,COMMA massless ,COMMA purposeless and dimensionless .PERIOD <BREAK>

he said ,COMMA oh ,COMMA i can't move my phantom .PERIOD you know that .PERIOD it's painful .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it's like a dial on human nature .PERIOD <BREAK>
and clearly this composition is his final statement to her -- it was first performed after his death -- and through her to the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
and in order to get these kinds of computations started right ,COMMA you need some kind of input ,COMMA a kind of seed .PERIOD <BREAK>
the culmination of this is if you've successfully raised your tadpole ,COMMA observing the behavioral and developmental events ,COMMA you will then go and introduce your tadpole to its namesake and discuss the evidence that you've seen .PERIOD <BREAK>
thank you .PERIOD <BREAK>
the prakash ,COMMA the overall effort has three components :COLON outreach ,COMMA to identify children in need of care ;SEMICOLON medical treatment ;SEMICOLON and in subsequent study .PERIOD <BREAK>

all of humanity ,COMMA probably ,COMMA is descended from a thousand people who left africa roughly <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> years ago .PERIOD <BREAK>
sys admin force has to .PERIOD <BREAK>
i also believe that in thinking about things -- my thinking about luck ,COMMA and fate ,COMMA and coincidences and accidents ,COMMA god's will ,COMMA and the synchrony of mysterious forces -- i will come to some notion of what that is ,COMMA how we create .PERIOD <BREAK>
if you thought ,COMMA everybody loves classical music -- they just haven't found out about it yet .PERIOD <BREAK>
you can draw your simple stick figure ,COMMA and then it collaborates with you to create ,COMMA sort of ,COMMA like ,COMMA a post-war german etching .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so when i come back from these trips ,COMMA and i'm thinking about development ,COMMA and i'm flying home and i'm thinking ,COMMA we're trying to deliver condoms to people or vaccinations ,COMMA you know ,COMMA coke's success kind of stops and makes you wonder :COLON how is it that they can get coke to these far-flung places ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and we're finding more and more and more gender differences in the brain .PERIOD <BREAK>
and that happened for all museums .PERIOD <BREAK>
so i got all these sort of magic tricks .PERIOD oh ,COMMA here .PERIOD i'll show you .PERIOD <BREAK>
there's a billion people without clean drinking water .PERIOD <BREAK>
and there's the first little cam that drove furby .PERIOD <BREAK>
imagine way back ,COMMA four and a half billion years ago ,COMMA there is a vast chemical soup of stuff .PERIOD <BREAK>
but ,COMMA it turns out some component of stroke paralysis is also learned paralysis ,COMMA and maybe that component can be overcome using mirrors .PERIOD <BREAK>
i got my masters ,COMMA and then went to art school after that .PERIOD <BREAK>
but what it shows first ,COMMA which i think is quite interesting ,COMMA is that here you see the circle ,COMMA you see the public space around it .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i believe that we must have faith .PERIOD <BREAK>
man :COLON i clean my ceiling fans with that and i get the spider webs off my house -- i do it that way .PERIOD <BREAK>
what we've discovered is you have to give them flowers and sunlight and food and expectations and herbie's music ,COMMA and you can cure a spiritual cancer every time .PERIOD <BREAK>
robert dill-bundi :COLON my quality of life ,COMMA i rate what i have today a bit different than what most people would assume .PERIOD <BREAK>
depthx is an all-seeing eyeball .PERIOD <BREAK>
i think cities facilitate more of the kind of networking ,COMMA the kind of casual interaction than you might have on a daily basis .PERIOD <BREAK>
at interface we really intend to bring this prototypical sustainable ,COMMA zero-footprint industrial company fully into existence by <NUM> .PERIOD <BREAK>
you cannot talk to everybody all the time .PERIOD <BREAK>
i don't believe it and i think this idea ,COMMA popular as it is -- not in this guise but in general -- is itself one of the main problems that we face .PERIOD <BREAK>
i have learned a lot from people like najmuddin ,COMMA mahmoud ,COMMA rafi .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA i know what you're thinking :COLON that's a lot of work ,COMMA isn't it ?QUESTIONMARK isn't it a ton of work to be able to tell the time ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
that's a cool name .PERIOD i will say that .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it's a picture we've seen several times .PERIOD <BREAK>
the key is in the red zone .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so ,COMMA like many people ,COMMA we start with a house on a lot ,COMMA and i'm going to show you a typical construction on the top and what we're doing on the bottom .PERIOD <BREAK>
now we had to start changing these people and converting them from using that for a livelihood ,COMMA to getting something else .PERIOD <BREAK>
then you can drill down and understand how actually we put your level in context ,COMMA and we use color to illustrate exactly where your value falls .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it was rigged ,COMMA and it became unraveled when this man ,COMMA charles van doren ,COMMA was outed after an unnatural winning streak ,COMMA ending berry's career .PERIOD <BREAK>
instead of it being the case that that junction box in the spinal cord is just simple where one nerve connects with the next nerve by releasing these little brown packets of chemical information called neurotransmitters in a linear one-on-one fashion ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA what happens is the neurotransmitters spill out in three dimensions -- laterally ,COMMA vertically ,COMMA up and down in the spinal cord -- and they start interacting with other adjacent cells .PERIOD <BREAK>
this part's not going to be on the test .PERIOD <BREAK>
so wherever the fire is eating the paper ,COMMA that's what becomes the work -- detail .PERIOD <BREAK>
the mclaren just popped off and scratched the side panel .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so they took them to some safe place .PERIOD <BREAK>
the cost is incidental but the gesture is huge .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA in some sense ,COMMA what this is suggesting is that it's not just that people are setting up their car seats wrong ,COMMA which is putting children at risk .PERIOD it's just that ,COMMA fundamentally ,COMMA the car seats aren't doing much .PERIOD <BREAK>
and we don't have all the updated data any longer ,COMMA because this is really hot data today .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA welcome to oxford ,COMMA ladies and gentlemen .PERIOD <BREAK>
i just wasn't drunk or high .PERIOD <BREAK>
and then ,COMMA because i'm looking for the upside here ,COMMA i've got to have believable upside .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i thought ,COMMA hey ,COMMA you know ,COMMA i can build on this .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's because we don't think rocks can suffer .PERIOD and if we're more concerned about our fellow primates than we are about insects ,COMMA as indeed we are ,COMMA it's because we think they're exposed to a greater range of potential happiness and suffering .PERIOD <BREAK>
there were claims of intimidation at the polling stations ,COMMA of ballot boxes being stolen .PERIOD <BREAK>
now andy lipkis is working to help l .PERIOD a .PERIOD cut infrastructure costs associated with water management and urban heat island -- linking trees ,COMMA people and technology to create a more livable city .PERIOD <BREAK>

this device ,COMMA the ade <NUM> ,COMMA was sold to the iraqi government for <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> dollars apiece .PERIOD <BREAK>
life is so great that we only get such a short time to experience and enjoy all those tiny little moments that make it so sweet .PERIOD <BREAK>
more recently ,COMMA i wrote an article for esquire called -- about radical honesty .PERIOD <BREAK>
google enriches itself by enriching thousands of bloggers through adsense .PERIOD <BREAK>
that's a key trend ,COMMA which is decentralization ,COMMA moving from centralized nuclear power plants and liquid natural gas tankers to decentralized resources that are environmentally more friendly ,COMMA a lot more efficient and capable and safe from disruption .PERIOD <BREAK>
and you follow the treatment like that ,COMMA to the end of the treatment .PERIOD <BREAK>
whether water level goes up or down ,COMMA the beauty is there throughout .PERIOD <BREAK>
so we took a room downstairs in the basement that had been used as sort of an abu ghraib annex .PERIOD <BREAK>
gray-yellow hair ,COMMA army pants under a nightgown ,COMMA her turning away ,COMMA hiding her ravaged face in her hands ,COMMA muttering an inappropriate hi .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's urgent work .PERIOD we know that temperatures are rising .PERIOD <BREAK>
two of the big success stories of the last <NUM> years in retail -- one sells things that are super-expensive in a blue box ,COMMA and one sells things that are as cheap as they can make them .PERIOD <BREAK>
and then backtrack innovations within that .PERIOD <BREAK>
i don't have an answer to the fact that there seem to be bad technologies .PERIOD i don't have an answer to how this impacts on our dignity ,COMMA other than to suggest that maybe the seventh kingdom ,COMMA because it's so close to what life is about ,COMMA maybe we can bring it back and have it help us monitor life .PERIOD <BREAK>
oh ,COMMA they're gone ,COMMA ok .PERIOD <BREAK>
well ,COMMA there are a couple estimates of how much it would cost to create a network of protected areas covering <NUM> percent of the ocean that would be only a fraction of what we are now paying ;SEMICOLON the government hands out to a fishery that is collapsing .PERIOD <BREAK>
there is more of it than you think ,COMMA actually .PERIOD <BREAK>
who's got the work ethic now ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
but they can do pretty amazing things ,COMMA too .PERIOD <BREAK>
where it's blue and it's green ,COMMA it means the water is really cold .PERIOD <BREAK>
but you know ,COMMA these stories ,COMMA and lots of other experiments that we've done on conflicts of interest ,COMMA basically kind of bring two points to the foreground for me .PERIOD <BREAK>
in that time ,COMMA novocure's developed two systems -- one system for cancers in the head and another system for cancers in the trunk of the body .PERIOD <BREAK>
and we did .PERIOD the data was conclusive .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA we sponsor <NUM> children education programs today .PERIOD <BREAK>
matthew's legs don't work ,COMMA and he'll never walk again ,COMMA and -- and he does experience this as an and rather than a but -- and he experiences himself to be healed and whole .PERIOD <BREAK>
they said ,COMMA get me a tutor in what i suck at .PERIOD <BREAK>

it just flared up ,COMMA and he turned around ,COMMA and he looked like this .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's related to an existing chandler pavilion that was built with a lot of love and tears and caring .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the experience is :COLON i want to be in the room and hear the musicians .PERIOD <BREAK>
so how would you run a whole country without oil ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
we need to fundamentally redefine who it is that experts are .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the question he had is ,COMMA can i do it ?QUESTIONMARK can it be done ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and that -- forget the tools ,COMMA forget the moving around of resources -- that stuff's easy .PERIOD <BREAK>
now ,COMMA how do we go about that sort of thing ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
because if you could find those ,COMMA those would be some of the signals that could drive learning .PERIOD <BREAK>
and what he was doing was ,COMMA he was teaching her to browse .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's simply to use language around them ,COMMA because the driving force in language acquisition is to understand what others ,COMMA that are important to you ,COMMA are saying to you .PERIOD <BREAK>
now it's doing wall-following ,COMMA it's following around my feet to clean up around me .PERIOD let's see ,COMMA let's -- oh ,COMMA who stole my rice krispies ?QUESTIONMARK they stole my rice krispies !EXCLAMATIONMARK <BREAK>

if we were having this ted meeting in our grandparents' day ,COMMA that might not be so big a claim .PERIOD <BREAK>
when you want less ,COMMA it's because it's about work .PERIOD <BREAK>

i've rescued children as young as three years ,COMMA and i've rescued women as old as <NUM> years .PERIOD <BREAK>
more than <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> children in the united states aged <NUM> and under begin smoking every year .PERIOD <BREAK>

you see apples that are red ,COMMA yellow ,COMMA and green and that's about it .PERIOD <BREAK>
i work ,COMMA he said .PERIOD <BREAK>
and here's the point of that .PERIOD <BREAK>
and if you're a radar ,COMMA that's a really bad job .PERIOD <BREAK>
i'm also looking to take my work from the two-dimensional form to a more three-dimensional form .PERIOD <BREAK>
is there something wrong with you you're not telling us ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and we have a lot of skill and experience ,COMMA but it's a trick ,COMMA so how are you supposed to prepare to get through that glass ceiling ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
now ,COMMA some people call that a theory of everything .PERIOD <BREAK>
and you put lots of those together ,COMMA you get the essentials of the modern computer :COLON the arithmetic unit ,COMMA the central control ,COMMA the memory ,COMMA the recording medium ,COMMA the input and the output .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i'm happy to say that there are several very promising developments in this area ,COMMA looking at the impact of shipping on whales .PERIOD <BREAK>
why do i feel like i've got to pretend that i'm more than i really am ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
there's one fellow out there ,COMMA van praagh is his name ,COMMA james van praagh .PERIOD <BREAK>

when the soviet union broke up ,COMMA we effectively lost that adversary as a potential attacker of the united states ,COMMA for the most part .PERIOD <BREAK>
because i had just been in the falkland islands taking pictures of penguins .PERIOD <BREAK>
they mesh-enabled <NUM> buses and they speak to these smart terminals .PERIOD <BREAK>
and this gave birth to the idea of having toroidal generating geometry ,COMMA one with its center deep in the earth for the landside building and a toroid with its center in the sky for the island building .PERIOD <BREAK>
why can't we solve these problems ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>

and third chance for sweden ,COMMA against brazil here .PERIOD <BREAK>
while we initially heralded the internet as the fantastic new marketing device that was going to solve all our problems ,COMMA we now realize that the internet is ,COMMA if anything ,COMMA too effective in that regard .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it's in complete silence when i filmed it ,COMMA because i was only hearing the music in my head ,COMMA imagining the choir that would one day come to be .PERIOD <BREAK>
as i walked out ,COMMA her pace slowed .PERIOD <BREAK>

i have worked with women and for women all my life .PERIOD <BREAK>

to see -- wait a minute ,COMMA we can go kshhplash !EXCLAMATIONMARK -- right there ,COMMA ha -- under the ocean ,COMMA see what the whales see .PERIOD <BREAK>

at ideo there’s a kind of a back-to-preschool feel sometimes about the environment .PERIOD <BREAK>

it's probably why i'm a little bit panicked right now -- other than all the caffeine that i've had and the sugar -- but this is really creepy for an entrepreneur .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA it's a very difficult thing to get people to expand the moral imagination to a place it doesn't naturally go .PERIOD <BREAK>
but things are also changing at a very rapid pace .PERIOD <BREAK>
and afrigadget is a blog that looks at technology in an africa context .PERIOD <BREAK>

and if africa is going to get fixed ,COMMA it's by them ,COMMA not by us .PERIOD <BREAK>

duh !EXCLAMATIONMARK <NUM> percent of the students ,COMMA two-thirds ,COMMA prefer to be in the course where they have the opportunity to change their mind .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's very destructive ,COMMA but it also catalyzes the production of vitamin d in the skin ,COMMA vitamin d being a molecule that we very much need for our strong bones ,COMMA the health of our immune system ,COMMA and myriad other important functions in our bodies .PERIOD <BREAK>
so our concept is really this back-to-the-future concept ,COMMA harnessing the intelligence of that land settlement pattern .PERIOD <BREAK>
agnes de mille is one of the great choreographers in our history .PERIOD <BREAK>
they have an increased risk of infection ,COMMA an increased risk of malignancy .PERIOD <BREAK>

what's common among these groups of cells is that they all produce the neurotransmitter dopamine .PERIOD <BREAK>

this guy built a bowling alley in his backyard ,COMMA out of landscaping timbers ,COMMA astroturf .PERIOD <BREAK>

so we get inside the pantheon and it grows and so on and so forth .PERIOD <BREAK>
in other words ,COMMA early humans are eating dead animals -- no argument ,COMMA that's a fact .PERIOD <BREAK>
so we're not -- we're pretty kludge-y ourselves .PERIOD <BREAK>
the mind does its best to organize and to give some sort of coherence to this ,COMMA but not terribly successfully .PERIOD <BREAK>

i actually get phone calls from people who want to know what lottery numbers are going to win .PERIOD <BREAK>

we can see matter .PERIOD but we can't see what's the matter .PERIOD <BREAK>
now ,COMMA i agree that you have to -- yeah ,COMMA there are certain concessions and ,COMMA you know ,COMMA if you use a slide projector ,COMMA you're not able to have the bad type swing in from the back or the side ,COMMA or up or down ,COMMA but maybe that's an o .PERIOD k .PERIOD trade-off ,COMMA to trade that off for a focus .PERIOD <BREAK>
there weren't many of them available ,COMMA and they weren't quite as easy to find as the foreign books .PERIOD <BREAK>
there's a guy pushing there ,COMMA behind ,COMMA but can also walk on the wind very well .PERIOD <BREAK>

let me tell you a nigerian joke .PERIOD <BREAK>
that amazing juxtaposition of old and new ,COMMA the bits of light that come down between the buildings that sort of create a map that's traveling above your head of usually blue -- especially in the summer -- compared to the map that you would normally expect to see of conventional streets .PERIOD <BREAK>
perhaps it's a giant philosophical change in how we view life .PERIOD <BREAK>

a marketplace was hit by a mortar shell that killed several members of a single family .PERIOD <BREAK>

i feel a bit about it like i did about a very strict math teacher that i once had at school .PERIOD <BREAK>
window dressing .PERIOD <BREAK>
ooooh .PERIOD <BREAK>
i could do a whole talk on the matrix and glamour .PERIOD <BREAK>
so we have new designs that are helping us take mechanical things that we used to spend energy on -- like heating ,COMMA cooling etc .PERIOD -- and turn them into things that we avoid spending energy on .PERIOD <BREAK>
you wait as burns and other critical patients are treated ,COMMA because <NUM> percent of the patients who go to an emergency room with chest pains don't have ami ,COMMA so you're not taken very seriously .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's called the great western railway .PERIOD <BREAK>
but also that is able to carry out attacks in more than one country .PERIOD <BREAK>
dark matter ,COMMA because it gravitationally attracts ,COMMA it tends to encourage the growth of structure ,COMMA ok .PERIOD <BREAK>
so i'm going to give you the chance to get your name on a new symmetrical object which hasn't been named before .PERIOD <BREAK>
so as it expands and as things expand what we have is the potential for differences ,COMMA diversity ,COMMA options ,COMMA choices ,COMMA opportunities ,COMMA possibilities and freedoms .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's really a sort of magical moment .PERIOD <BREAK>
but grassroots groups are needed at the table during the decision-making process .PERIOD <BREAK>

it was recognizing that public libraries are the last vestige of public free space .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is not about money .PERIOD <BREAK>

and then we watched ,COMMA as one case arrived on the east coast of the united states and it marched every year ,COMMA westwardly .PERIOD <BREAK>
and boy do we stink out here .PERIOD <BREAK>
one thing i want to point out is that underneath these live epiphytes ,COMMA as they die and decompose ,COMMA they actually construct an arboreal soil ,COMMA both in the temperate zone and in the tropics .PERIOD <BREAK>
one ,COMMA in a hundred years ,COMMA transit on all major rail and road corridors .PERIOD <BREAK>

just give me your company logo .PERIOD <BREAK>
when i realized this ,COMMA and when i look back on my time at the security council and what happened with the kosovars ,COMMA and i realize that often the people who were most directly affected by what we were doing in the security council weren't actually there ,COMMA weren't actually invited to give their views to the security council ,COMMA i thought ,COMMA this is wrong .PERIOD <BREAK>
so this was the pre-bureaucratic age .PERIOD <BREAK>
imagine if you're speaking with somebody who's growing things and making them flourish ,COMMA somebody who's using their talents to do something productive ,COMMA somebody who's built their own business from scratch ,COMMA someone who is surrounded by abundance ,COMMA not scarcity ,COMMA who's in fact creating abundance ,COMMA somebody with full hands with something to offer ,COMMA not empty hands asking for you to give them something .PERIOD <BREAK>

and ,COMMA i love this story so much .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is a kohler shower ,COMMA a waterfall shower ,COMMA and actually ,COMMA all those knobs beneath are also showerheads .PERIOD <BREAK>
i don't think we need to be convinced of that .PERIOD i think we know ;SEMICOLON in fact ,COMMA i think we know so much ,COMMA and it's such a reality that we care so deeply ,COMMA that in fact ,COMMA what usually stops us is that we're afraid to try and to mess up ,COMMA because we care so very much about helping each other and being meaningful in each other's lives .PERIOD <BREAK>
now that's a good characteristic .PERIOD <BREAK>
and in italian ,COMMA ghironda ,COMMA okay ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and professor cilliers was very kind and talked me through it .PERIOD <BREAK>
the plate corresponds to a coordinate system .PERIOD <BREAK>
but ,COMMA the issue is that when i talked about that example ,COMMA it's not just about talking about india ,COMMA it's not propaganda .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's just two drops ,COMMA like that .PERIOD <BREAK>
so the camera's black and white .PERIOD <BREAK>
we can't relate to her .PERIOD she speaks in a funny way .PERIOD <BREAK>
and when we think about the classic image of the scientist in the lab ,COMMA we have this image -- you know ,COMMA they're pouring over the microscope ,COMMA and they see something in the tissue sample .PERIOD <BREAK>

when we look at this new unified pattern ,COMMA we can see a couple of gaps where particles seem to be missing .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so ,COMMA that was a really catalytic thing for them .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA i'll plug that in .PERIOD <BREAK>
and at first this didn't get a lot of support .PERIOD <BREAK>
but here he stands as testament to the fact that you can't roughhouse on the playground today .PERIOD <BREAK>
and people magazine ,COMMA i thought ,COMMA got probably the best shot .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's the sensible shoe of public address .PERIOD <BREAK>
i could have taken him to new york ,COMMA and he would have died in a day .PERIOD <BREAK>
and when i look out at particularly this galaxy ,COMMA which looks a lot like ours ,COMMA i wonder if there's an art design college conference going on ,COMMA and intelligent beings there are thinking about ,COMMA you know ,COMMA what designs they might do ,COMMA and there might be a few cosmologists trying to understand where the universe itself came from ,COMMA and there might even be some in that galaxy looking at ours trying to figure out what's going on over here .PERIOD <BREAK>
so as for that second sphere ,COMMA not of work ,COMMA but of love -- encompassing family ,COMMA friends and colleagues -- it ,COMMA too ,COMMA takes work and commitment .PERIOD <BREAK>
i could hear it ,COMMA but i dared not to move .PERIOD i didn't move .PERIOD <BREAK>

a lot of them -- about <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> people so far -- are cash-flow positive :COLON they're making money from what -- i mean ,COMMA real-world money -- from what they're doing in second life ,COMMA so it's a very build -- still a creative ,COMMA building things ,COMMA build-your-own-business type of an orientation .PERIOD so ,COMMA that's it .PERIOD <BREAK>
here's a logistics system ,COMMA a small piece of one that we're currently building .PERIOD <BREAK>

stay in .PERIOD <BREAK>
and what we've done is that we've turned the bullet into a light source ,COMMA so that bullet is actually shining ,COMMA and it makes it really easy to find these fragments .PERIOD <BREAK>

and a few years after i left ,COMMA i went back ,COMMA and the chairman of the burn department was very excited to see me -- said ,COMMA dan ,COMMA i have a fantastic new treatment for you .PERIOD <BREAK>
so keep both of those ideas of remoteness .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is kanzi .PERIOD <BREAK>
i think we would have gotten there a lot earlier if we could see what happens in the ocean like we can see what happens on land .PERIOD <BREAK>
they were the ones that didn't get paid .PERIOD <BREAK>

so calculus has traditionally been taught very late .PERIOD <BREAK>
but idealism allied with pragmatism ,COMMA with rolling up your sleeves and making the world bend a bit ,COMMA is very exciting .PERIOD it's very real .PERIOD it's very strong .PERIOD <BREAK>
we do what that group does that we're trying to identify with .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the logo -- even though it looks extremely irish ,COMMA it's actually derived from the indian symbol of diya ,COMMA an earthen lamp .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's what's known as a bioluminescent burglar alarm ,COMMA and just like the alarm on your car or your house ,COMMA it's meant to cast unwanted attention onto the intruder ,COMMA thereby either leading to his capture or scaring him away .PERIOD <BREAK>
they began to shut down the media that the protests were happening on .PERIOD <BREAK>

before we do that ,COMMA i want to kind of put biology in its place .PERIOD <BREAK>

they were not allowed diplomats .PERIOD <BREAK>
and they sat on it for months actually .PERIOD <BREAK>

peres thought that was a great idea .PERIOD <BREAK>
and rus hoelzel came up with an effective population size :COLON <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> animals .PERIOD <BREAK>
and snow labored for a long time with this great insight that everybody ignored .PERIOD <BREAK>
so just through self-assembly ,COMMA mixing things together in the lab ,COMMA we can come up with ,COMMA say ,COMMA a metabolic surface with some informational molecules attached inside of this membrane body ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
it happened through a principle known as kin selection .PERIOD <BREAK>

he found himself in kenya on a fulbright and he had a very interesting insight ,COMMA which is that he said ,COMMA there must be entrepreneurs in kenya ;SEMICOLON there must be entrepreneurs everywhere .PERIOD <BREAK>
so english mania is a turning point .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i had kept in good shape ,COMMA but swimming's a whole different animal .PERIOD <BREAK>
and there is some truth to this ,COMMA in the sense that we have something of a finite resource ,COMMA and increased growth is going to push up demand for that .PERIOD <BREAK>
right ?QUESTIONMARK it's not what it says it is .PERIOD it's not really the magic kingdom .PERIOD <BREAK>
and we worked very closely with the whole thing being a team effort ,COMMA and with wonderful results like that flight .PERIOD <BREAK>
and when we were walking through the narrow alleys ,COMMA it was literally impossible not to step in the raw sewage and the garbage alongside the little homes .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is a roughly normal scan ,COMMA showing equal distribution of energy .PERIOD <BREAK>
so then once you do that you're like ,COMMA oh ,COMMA crap .PERIOD where am i going to put all this ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and so i realized we had to go through the business of building an informed citizenry .PERIOD <BREAK>
and this is ,COMMA by the way ,COMMA something that a democratic society also has to do .PERIOD <BREAK>
and he was rubbing it with a cloth .PERIOD <BREAK>
but what happened was ,COMMA the rules changed ,COMMA and they never got to make partner .PERIOD <BREAK>

i was very excited .PERIOD i walked with him to his office .PERIOD <BREAK>
and my little idea that will do that is sleep .PERIOD <BREAK>
sometimes a knowledge of history and the past failures of utopian ideals can be a burden because you know that if everything were free ,COMMA then the food stocks would become depleted and scarce and lead to chaos .PERIOD <BREAK>
so these animals go into a molting period where they're unable to strike -- their bodies become very soft .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the entire <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> people went absolutely crazy .PERIOD <BREAK>
we've discovered over <NUM> in the last <NUM> years ,COMMA including the small planet ,COMMA announced earlier this week ,COMMA which has a radius just twice the size of the earth .PERIOD <BREAK>

there is portable ones .PERIOD there is large display ones .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i can go on .PERIOD dollars ,COMMA on and on ,COMMA into the system .PERIOD <BREAK>
perhaps you have a computer scientist who's a genius .PERIOD <BREAK>
because ,COMMA really ,COMMA what i'm trying to do now is redefine what counts as health .PERIOD <BREAK>
it will bring all of your family together .PERIOD <BREAK>
so our facial appearance is vital to us as we're trying to project ourselves to the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA what we've done is we've succeeded in making something much bigger than a dna origami by combining dna origami with tiles .PERIOD <BREAK>
instead ,COMMA we ought to be using computers to do step three and using the students to spend much more effort on learning how to do steps one ,COMMA two and four -- conceptualizing problems ,COMMA applying them ,COMMA getting the teacher to run them through how to do that .PERIOD <BREAK>
so economists talk about game theory -- that every two-person game has a nash equilibrium .PERIOD <BREAK>
of course ,COMMA the women were much more intelligent than the men .PERIOD <BREAK>
you go under this bridge at about <NUM> miles an hour ,COMMA and there's another bridge here .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i decided the remedy to all this malaise was going to be for me to chase an elevated dream ,COMMA an extreme dream ,COMMA something that would require utter conviction and unwavering passion ,COMMA something that would make me be my best self in every aspect of my life ,COMMA every minute of every day ,COMMA because the dream was so big that i couldn't get there without that kind of behavior and that kind of conviction .PERIOD <BREAK>

we were hoping that it wass going to have a kind of evil ,COMMA spidery walk ,COMMA but instead it created this pretty lame way of moving forward .PERIOD <BREAK>
anywhere between five and <NUM> percent increase in adherence ,COMMA just as a result of this .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is the legacy of manifest destiny .PERIOD <BREAK>
now we may not agree with what religions are trying to teach us ,COMMA but we can admire the institutional way in which they're doing it .PERIOD <BREAK>
i had my own personal responses ,COMMA but i also have a public role ,COMMA and something needed to be said .PERIOD <BREAK>

i don't say let's go back to the copper canyons and live on corn and maize ,COMMA which is the tarahumara's preferred diet ,COMMA but maybe there's somewhere in between .PERIOD <BREAK>
and you can create parts with moving components ,COMMA hinges ,COMMA parts within parts .PERIOD <BREAK>
but it's sublinear ,COMMA and what that translates into is that ,COMMA if you double the size of the organism ,COMMA you actually only need <NUM> percent more energy .PERIOD <BREAK>
and when you turn the switch off ,COMMA the light goes off .PERIOD <BREAK>
you all know the test for artificial intelligence -- the turing test .PERIOD <BREAK>
you can imagine with this big surface of a skysurfing board ,COMMA there is a lot of force ,COMMA a lot of power .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the image of the dvd here is just to illustrate a point that silk follows very subtle topographies of the surface ,COMMA which means that it can replicate features on the nanoscale .PERIOD <BREAK>
the luminous room is a system in which it's considered that input and output spaces are co-located .PERIOD <BREAK>
and if we think about the increase of biomass inside the reserves ,COMMA this is like compound interest .PERIOD <BREAK>
because she'd be like ,COMMA you know -- she'd get on the phone .PERIOD <BREAK>

i mean ,COMMA it's leading firms -- many of them are still publicly owned .PERIOD <BREAK>
we use this idea called self-assembly .PERIOD <BREAK>

if you were going to go and try to create spaceshipone ,COMMA or any kind of a new technology ,COMMA you have to fund that from the beginning and maintain that funding with an uncertain outcome .PERIOD <BREAK>
this shows one of the most extreme caves that we work in .PERIOD <BREAK>
so vivian and i have been working together for <NUM> years .PERIOD <BREAK>

i want an iphone .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so this is one way to bet on good people doing good things .PERIOD <BREAK>
there is a scaling .PERIOD <BREAK>

you know ,COMMA the faculty there didn't want us to memorize information and repeat back to them as i was used to back in ghana .PERIOD <BREAK>
and then you try to say ,COMMA well ,COMMA the loved ones i love .PERIOD <BREAK>
but the reason it's number one is because that's the week it came out .PERIOD <BREAK>
and then i took a bite ,COMMA and i wished that it was tinier ,COMMA because kobe beef is so rich .PERIOD <BREAK>
sometimes i would see bones when there was a body there .PERIOD <BREAK>
well ,COMMA tyson did ,COMMA because there's no chicken in the chicken .PERIOD <BREAK>
so when he was only <NUM> and he became the paje ,COMMA he began to lead his people .PERIOD <BREAK>
these disorders -- schizophrenia ,COMMA alzheimer's ,COMMA depression ,COMMA addiction -- they not only steal our time to live ,COMMA they change who we are .PERIOD <BREAK>
the first move is going to be what ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
greetings to all of you from pakistan .PERIOD <BREAK>
but remember ,COMMA this is taking place in our strange ,COMMA weird world ,COMMA and so inevitably the ability to download these video clips to ,COMMA you know ,COMMA your ipod or your zune gives you the ability to turn it into entertainment .PERIOD <BREAK>
most of us -- now that the me decade is well in the past -- now we actually do this .PERIOD <BREAK>
here's an article in nature that profiled this work ,COMMA and another one in time .PERIOD <BREAK>
we already know how to kill malaria ,COMMA but some people come to you and say ,COMMA you have your millions .PERIOD how about bed nets ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
<NUM> is <NUM> -- ooh ,COMMA that's a harder one .PERIOD <BREAK>
i was offered a position as associate professor of medicine and chief of scientific visualization at yale university in the department of medicine .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's about the size of a rugby ball .PERIOD <BREAK>
but what happened was that he had to be on medication that ,COMMA at that time -- diflucan ,COMMA which in the states is used for yeast infections -- cost <NUM> dollars a pill .PERIOD <BREAK>
the notion of efficacy basically boils down to one -- that if somebody believes that they have the capacity to change their behavior .PERIOD <BREAK>
alright ,COMMA this is what it looks like on a good day .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i asked the manager to point out five of your fastest producers ,COMMA and then i went and looked at each one of them for about <NUM> or <NUM> minutes ,COMMA and picked this one woman .PERIOD <BREAK>
start with telling them what the market is .PERIOD <BREAK>
they've got hair all over them .PERIOD <BREAK>
and if you talk about a <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> -dollar shoe ,COMMA you're talking about <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> days of income .PERIOD <BREAK>
many of us think that compassion drains us ,COMMA but i promise you it is something that truly enlivens us .PERIOD <BREAK>
we're looking for this behavior among white voters or ,COMMA really ,COMMA non-black voters .PERIOD <BREAK>
and that's me with youssou n'dour ,COMMA onstage ,COMMA having the time of my life .PERIOD <BREAK>
but if you're a leader ,COMMA the people you've counted on will help you up .PERIOD <BREAK>
and that is how this difference has come .PERIOD <BREAK>
i began to make led sculptures that would live inside little boxes out of mdf .PERIOD <BREAK>
i grew up on a university campus in eastern nigeria .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so i went to the hotel ,COMMA and i found two older amerasians .PERIOD <BREAK>
well ,COMMA you see the nice story of getting richer and getting healthier -- everyone did it at the cost of emission of carbon dioxide .PERIOD <BREAK>
or for instance ,COMMA the reason why violence becomes more common in more unequal societies is because people are sensitive to being looked down on .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i remember putting my blocks in and just feeling horrified because there was just this murmur coming over the crowd ,COMMA like ,COMMA the ones who are close enough to the starting line to see .PERIOD <BREAK>
there's jeff bezos on the right and paul saville on the left looking for galena ,COMMA which is the lead-silver thing .PERIOD they didn't find any .PERIOD <BREAK>
the glass was then -- i'll just use the word impregnated -- but it had a layer of metal that was called stressed metal .PERIOD <BREAK>
we can actually see how they're using ecospaces as large as an ocean .PERIOD <BREAK>
so where i started was with connection .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's very ,COMMA very different .PERIOD and it's a memory of these very high-dimensional patterns ,COMMA like the things that come from your eyes .PERIOD <BREAK>
there's like a billion social sites on the web .PERIOD <BREAK>
okay ,COMMA it's called itself a nation-state for the last hundred years ,COMMA but everyone who knows anything about china knows it's a lot older than this .PERIOD <BREAK>
he had this line in his book that supposedly comes from the habsburg monarchy ,COMMA where there was an empress maria theresa ,COMMA who was having trouble conceiving .PERIOD <BREAK>
so i hope that ,COMMA together ,COMMA we'll create something that the world will remember .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's not folded ,COMMA that's a photograph and it's cut on the diagonal .PERIOD <BREAK>
but now ,COMMA when you have this trend line ,COMMA how do we measure progress ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
are you with child ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
like a lot of predators ,COMMA they walk on their toes .PERIOD <BREAK>
put your money where you mouth is .PERIOD <BREAK>
and you can take them on an emotional -- all pitches ,COMMA or all sales presentations ,COMMA are emotional at some level .PERIOD <BREAK>
and we've had the retreat from special-ness under the barrage of science and technology many times over the last few hundred years ,COMMA at least .PERIOD <BREAK>
in <NUM> ,COMMA we launched our first slate of films ,COMMA murder ball ,COMMA north country ,COMMA syriana and good night and good luck .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is his sister .PERIOD <BREAK>
and that is ,COMMA of course ,COMMA what we are here to talk about .PERIOD <BREAK>
and deterrence theory is a very simple theory of human behavior :COLON if you want somebody to do less of something ,COMMA add a punishment and they'll do less of it .PERIOD <BREAK>
but we do expect mastery .PERIOD <BREAK>
you know ,COMMA coyote in central park ,COMMA a whale in the gowanus canal ,COMMA elk in westchester county .PERIOD <BREAK>
every single bead ,COMMA every single colored band ,COMMA represents a weather element that can also be read as a musical note .PERIOD <BREAK>
they recognized what was happening on the hillside and put a stop to it ;SEMICOLON enacted laws and made permits required to do responsible construction and golf course maintenance and stopped the sediments flowing into the bay ,COMMA and stopped the chemicals flowing into the bay ,COMMA and the bay recovered .PERIOD <BREAK>
everyone i met ,COMMA i felt i knew them for as long as i could remember .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the way you engineer this heart valve is the same strategy .PERIOD <BREAK>
so where it's happening ,COMMA we can see ,COMMA but what is happening will remain invisible only .PERIOD <BREAK>
how would you talk ?QUESTIONMARK how would you be ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
nathan left and went to tompkins county ,COMMA new york -- a place as different from san francisco as you can be and still be in the united states .PERIOD and he did it again .PERIOD <BREAK>
it is stopping the tar sands .PERIOD <BREAK>
all of these would have been great things to do ,COMMA and my nurses had no idea .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's actually a nickname given to priests in the eighteenth century .PERIOD <BREAK>
maybe it's a problem of the political culture ,COMMA and we have to think about how to change that political culture .PERIOD <BREAK>
now you get it .PERIOD <BREAK>
the oil is not liquid .PERIOD <BREAK>
i want you to imagine all the negative energy from that broken relationship ,COMMA from that guy ,COMMA being imparted into the broken piece of glass ,COMMA which will represent him ,COMMA ok .PERIOD <BREAK>
we have reached a moment from which can emerge a great society within one generation .PERIOD <BREAK>
there is another part of the brain which is especially activated when one sees cartoons .PERIOD <BREAK>
not all the time -- these things aren't absolute -- but a lot of the time .PERIOD <BREAK>
so we went on and we looked in wikipedia ,COMMA we found this map .PERIOD <BREAK>
so now -- i always ask ,COMMA why do i put myself in this position ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
now ,COMMA <NUM> years later ,COMMA i'm proud to tell you ,COMMA last year we fed two million people in <NUM> countries through our foundation ,COMMA all during the holidays :COLON thanksgiving ,COMMA christmas -- -- in all the different countries around the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
now you may have seen in the news recently ,COMMA they came through with us at the end of last month with a few special exemptions that will allow the transition to be sold in the same category as suvs and light trucks .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it is an awesome thing to be a part of empowering someone in this way .PERIOD <BREAK>
there was criticism too because they said ,COMMA players are being bought and sold ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and i found that in my dance ,COMMA my dance ,COMMA my strength ,COMMA my energy ,COMMA my passion ,COMMA my very life breath .PERIOD <BREAK>
they're writing in big handwriting to take more gold .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i'm not the first person to ask this question .PERIOD <BREAK>
you know ,COMMA make you not follow your usual train of association ,COMMA but make you rewire .PERIOD <BREAK>
i expect health and joy and family and community .PERIOD <BREAK>
linearity means higher quality sound .PERIOD <BREAK>
i would go on a hunger strike before i let them take away google book search from me .PERIOD <BREAK>
people did not believe this .PERIOD <BREAK>
so let's get a sense of what is happening in this part of the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
but i really want to know what's driving you .PERIOD <BREAK>
thank you very much .PERIOD <BREAK>
you can't understand two people talking at once or in this case one person talking twice .PERIOD <BREAK>
and a lot of times that's what people think i do ,COMMA and it's the furthest thing from it .PERIOD what happens ,COMMA though ,COMMA is people say to me ,COMMA i don't need any motivation .PERIOD <BREAK>
we've been asking it here at ted already .PERIOD <BREAK>
now ,COMMA the second issue that i want to finish up with is :COLON how might we test for these extra dimensions more directly ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
but he was convinced of this .PERIOD <BREAK>
these senior water rights are key .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the fact that the demographics are in our favor ,COMMA because we are the only young country in an aging world ,COMMA makes globalization all the more attractive to indians .PERIOD <BREAK>
okay ?QUESTIONMARK oil droplet forms through self-assembly ,COMMA has a chemical metabolism inside so it can use energy ,COMMA and it uses that energy to move itself around in its environment .PERIOD <BREAK>
these four different forces interact with matter according to the corresponding charges that each particle has .PERIOD <BREAK>
then there were implicit commonalities that none of them seemed to be practicing .PERIOD <BREAK>
we have like <NUM> kids ,COMMA ex-child soldiers mixed with anybody that we feel like we want to support .PERIOD <BREAK>
there're <NUM> known variants of the common cold ,COMMA and there're only <NUM> because people got bored collecting them :COLON there are just new ones every year .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so i'm going to try to talk to you over the next few minutes about my career in terms of how i'm able to actually try to study music and really try to grapple with all these questions of how the brain is able to be creative .PERIOD <BREAK>
her five horrid ,COMMA deformed little dogs who incessantly yap on the roof under my window .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's just very good food .PERIOD <BREAK>
<NUM> of their programs that she pioneered are now government policy and funded by the government .PERIOD <BREAK>
i take it from this little dictum ,COMMA know thyself .PERIOD <BREAK>
we really got access to everybody in the gang .PERIOD <BREAK>
so al ,COMMA i actually think i'm rather good at branding .PERIOD <BREAK>
i went down to washington .PERIOD i saw these guys ,COMMA and said ,COMMA i did what you asked me .PERIOD i looked at what's out there .PERIOD <BREAK>
so i do believe that architecture as i see it needs to mirror that complexity in every single space that we have ,COMMA in every intimacy that we possess .PERIOD <BREAK>
and she said ,COMMA well ,COMMA if you got me a jeep ,COMMA i could get around a lot faster .PERIOD <BREAK>
one was his daughter ,COMMA laurence .PERIOD <BREAK>
and we can bring two million people a year into contact with this fish and show them its beauty .PERIOD <BREAK>
while in the third one ,COMMA in the calling ,COMMA very much likely i would do it also if i wouldn't be financially compensated for it .PERIOD <BREAK>
i had to sit down and make lists ,COMMA because i was ready to go ;SEMICOLON i was ready to check out of this world .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i really think that's where we are .PERIOD <BREAK>
every conceivable way you can vary spaghetti sauce ,COMMA he varied spaghetti sauce .PERIOD <BREAK>
but let me end with something i think much more important -- much more important than business .PERIOD <BREAK>
i mean ,COMMA i'm going to see so much work ,COMMA it's so intense -- i know probably las vegas meant a lot about it ,COMMA and i'm not really sure where the grand canyon came in either -- but somehow all this is going to come together ,COMMA and i'm going to see some really great product .PERIOD <BREAK>
i say we absolutely are irresponsible if we stay silent on this .PERIOD <BREAK>
although ,COMMA god knows ,COMMA of late ,COMMA in our hubris ,COMMA we seem to have drifted away .PERIOD <BREAK>
when i started this chair it was not a preconceived notion .PERIOD <BREAK>
by the time you realize what's happening ,COMMA the child is a toddler ,COMMA up and causing havoc ,COMMA and it's too late to put it back .PERIOD <BREAK>
and if we take the long-term trends of life ,COMMA if we begin to say ,COMMA what does evolution want ?QUESTIONMARK there's several things that we see .PERIOD <BREAK>
but if we were willing to spend <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> dollars for every child under five who dies ,COMMA that would be <NUM> billion per year just for that problem .PERIOD <BREAK>
of course ,COMMA when other physicists and i actually work on this stuff ,COMMA the mathematics can resemble a dark labyrinth .PERIOD <BREAK>
having said that ,COMMA it works with compressed nitrogen .PERIOD <BREAK>
you know the story .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's about two meters by three ,COMMA and you are all welcome any time .PERIOD <BREAK>
that means about <NUM> miles per hour .PERIOD <BREAK>
bruno giussani :COLON niall ,COMMA i am just curious about your take on the other region of the world that's booming ,COMMA which is latin america .PERIOD <BREAK>
thank you .PERIOD <BREAK>
and fraser's on his knees ,COMMA arms tied behind his back ,COMMA and he's crying .PERIOD <BREAK>
we compare each upload against all of the reference files in our database .PERIOD <BREAK>
and there's a <NUM> -dollar incubator giving that performance that had been created .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i'm going to show you a small sample of this ,COMMA but there's really a theoretical reason why technology develops in an exponential fashion .PERIOD <BREAK>
unfortunately ,COMMA he was smitten in more ways than one ,COMMA because it made him bankrupt ,COMMA and he had to tour the world speaking to recoup his money .PERIOD <BREAK>
so the first one is in the brain .PERIOD <BREAK>
no ,COMMA not everything fits so tidily into the paradigm ,COMMA but that does not mean there's not something going on at the highest possible levels .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i just remember feeling all these stories came out of the woodwork ,COMMA and i felt like i happened upon this secret society of women that i now was a part of ,COMMA which was reassuring and also really concerning .PERIOD <BREAK>
what if it would make it a little bit more palatable to have access via this ,COMMA as that last link to mass transit ,COMMA to get out to your cars so we can all live in the suburbs and use our cars the way we want ,COMMA and then have our cities energized again ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and now who would you rather be if a juicy piece of gossip -- not about you -- was spreading through the network ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
you just don't have it .PERIOD <BREAK>
soon ,COMMA it had occurred to me what my job was .PERIOD <BREAK>
doesn't it feel good to say it out loud ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
meanwhile ,COMMA as all of this is happening ,COMMA by the mid-' <NUM> s ,COMMA the business model of traditional broadcasting and cinema has been busted completely .PERIOD <BREAK>
so there's a strand that goes like this ,COMMA goes along one helix and binds -- it jumps to another helix and comes back .PERIOD <BREAK>
charles darwin must be spinning in his grave !EXCLAMATIONMARK <BREAK>
actually ,COMMA one indication is that little boy on my husband's shoulders has just graduated from high school .PERIOD <BREAK>
and when you've got that ,COMMA you've pretty much sacrificed any hope of making lots of money .PERIOD <BREAK>
ok ,COMMA ok ,COMMA ok .PERIOD oh ,COMMA my god !EXCLAMATIONMARK <BREAK>
in the dotted red line ,COMMA we show what the adoption would be in the random people ,COMMA and in the left-hand line ,COMMA shifted to the left ,COMMA we show what the adoption would be in the central individuals within the network .PERIOD <BREAK>
it was a little bit too funky ,COMMA and we wanted a more feminine point of view and employed a duck who did it in a much more fitting way -- fashion .PERIOD <BREAK>
i went outside what i thought i knew .PERIOD <BREAK>
you're aware of the perhaps apocryphal wal-mart stampede over the <NUM> -dollar dvd .PERIOD <BREAK>
because people don't have tools to cope with it ,COMMA to get over it .PERIOD <BREAK>
it changes with temperature and with barometric pressure .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA the modern equivalent would of course be this .PERIOD <BREAK>
learning to live on their own -- and it'll take couple of more years to let them walk on their own .PERIOD <BREAK>
they'll play it over ,COMMA and over ,COMMA and over .PERIOD <BREAK>
but what electronic miniaturization has done is that it has allowed people to shrink technology into a cell phone .PERIOD <BREAK>
but ,COMMA in a way ,COMMA the computer makes possible much more than what most people think ,COMMA and my art has just been about trying to find a personal way of using the computer ,COMMA and so i end up writing software to do that .PERIOD <BREAK>
but all this is for us to glorify the name of the creator whose primary name is the compassionating ,COMMA the compassionate .PERIOD <BREAK>
and our revenues are going to go this ,COMMA that and the other thing .PERIOD <BREAK>
and place cells also get this kind of path integration input from a kind of cell called a grid cell .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA it's like base camp everest .PERIOD <BREAK>
you know ,COMMA the system doesn't naturally make it happen .PERIOD <BREAK>
or women making fun of men is the same as men making fun of women .PERIOD <BREAK>
the wireless watch flopped miserably in the market ,COMMA but it wasn't because it wasn't simply and beautifully designed .PERIOD <BREAK>
so it was a little slow ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
that's my premise .PERIOD <BREAK>
so how can we know about the project ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and that might be smart in these nervous ,COMMA dangerous times .PERIOD <BREAK>
when you pick up a piece of history like that ,COMMA i think it can transform kids that are possibly interested in science .PERIOD <BREAK>
there are two orders of magnitude more spiders than primates .PERIOD <BREAK>
and he got me challenged to figure out an optical illusion room .PERIOD <BREAK>
there's something missing from these studies .PERIOD <BREAK>

and when it's closed ,COMMA you have a zero ,COMMA but you have a few ones thrown in .PERIOD <BREAK>
we actually managed to drown two million dollars' worth of camera gear .PERIOD <BREAK>
very good .PERIOD <BREAK>
we're very excited about the progress ,COMMA we do have a very long way to go though still ,COMMA and let me tell you a little bit more about that .PERIOD <BREAK>
we have every modality that can be done in vanderbilt ,COMMA cleveland clinic -- everywhere in the u .PERIOD s .PERIOD -- and we do it for about <NUM> percent of the cost that you will need to do those things in the united states .PERIOD <BREAK>
so a few years ago ,COMMA l .PERIOD a .PERIOD county decided that they needed to spend <NUM> .PERIOD <NUM> billion dollars to repair the city schools .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the second ,COMMA is that we actually don't have a clue of what all these products that surround us are made of .PERIOD <BREAK>
it didn't come from there .PERIOD the mountain bike came from users ,COMMA came from young users ,COMMA particularly a group in northern california ,COMMA who were frustrated with traditional racing bikes ,COMMA which were those sort of bikes that eddy merckx rode ,COMMA or your big brother ,COMMA and they're very glamorous .PERIOD <BREAK>
she was a congresswoman when there weren't very many congresswomen .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the way they represent information is they break up that data into little pieces that are represented by pulses and different neurons .PERIOD <BREAK>
so that's how it all started .PERIOD <BREAK>
and as they whiz by you ,COMMA it's like being passed by a little iron raisinet going up the hill .PERIOD <BREAK>
you only have to make one decision ,COMMA and that is :COLON are you going to use the white version for very good tedtalks ,COMMA about creativity ,COMMA human genius ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
that's all true .PERIOD <BREAK>
in fact ,COMMA <NUM> straight months of savings have happened since the beginning of the crisis .PERIOD <BREAK>

there's an interesting marketing lesson from it ,COMMA which is basically ,COMMA when you market a product ,COMMA you can either say ,COMMA this is going to be wonderful ,COMMA it will make you feel better and enliven you .PERIOD <BREAK>
but even in this concertinaed cosmic perspective ,COMMA our century is very ,COMMA very special ,COMMA the first when humans can change themselves and their home planet .PERIOD <BREAK>
and that's the structure of the city of curitiba .PERIOD <BREAK>
there is also another very important thing that i hope will resonate with this audience .PERIOD <BREAK>
when they bombed hiroshima ,COMMA the explosion formed a mini-supernova so every living animal ,COMMA human or plant that received direct contact with the rays from that sun was instantly turned to ash .PERIOD <BREAK>
and one of the things that i think is important is that we have to get away from this idea of designing the machines manually ,COMMA but actually let them evolve and learn ,COMMA like children ,COMMA and perhaps that's the way we'll get there .PERIOD thank you .PERIOD <BREAK>
if you mosquito-proof houses ,COMMA when people get sick ,COMMA they're sitting in bed -- or in mosquito-proof hospitals ,COMMA they're sitting in a hospital bed -- and the mosquitoes can't get to them .PERIOD <BREAK>

a lot of the funding that i have managed to raise has gone directly to treatment action campaign and the incredible work that they do ,COMMA and are still continuing to do in south africa .PERIOD <BREAK>

we will take it as a salutary warning ,COMMA i think ,COMMA for the rest of our conference this week .PERIOD <BREAK>

so ,COMMA enough scientists in other disciplines are really asking people to help ,COMMA and they're doing a good job of it .PERIOD <BREAK>
and just doing this i spent time in the archives -- that's another thing why my husband's a saint -- i spent time in the washington archives ,COMMA just sitting there ,COMMA looking for these things .PERIOD now it's online ,COMMA but he sat through that .PERIOD <BREAK>

this kind of a sequence is said to have a very low entropy because there's no variation at all .PERIOD <BREAK>
and we ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA when we have played this over the world .PERIOD <BREAK>

and actually this is where the adventure really started .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA what is it that we require ?QUESTIONMARK what is it that we need ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>

this beetle ,COMMA unlike this chip bag here ,COMMA this beetle uses one material ,COMMA chitin .PERIOD <BREAK>

is the latest tower in london a gherkin or a sausage or a sex tool ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and i was therefore able to photograph the fully assembled remains .PERIOD <BREAK>
so with seed-squeezers ,COMMA and pumps ,COMMA and hay-balers and very straightforward things that we're designing -- my students are doing this as class projects and ideo has donated their time to do this kind of work -- it's really amazing to see his success ,COMMA martin's .PERIOD <BREAK>
he looked a little sad ,COMMA because he said ,COMMA well ,COMMA a hundred years ago ,COMMA they went and took everything away from the haves .PERIOD <BREAK>
if we discover a spectrum like this we can be sure that there is life on that planet .PERIOD <BREAK>
in about the first billionth of a second or so ,COMMA the higgs field kicked in ,COMMA and the quarks and the gluons and the electrons that make us up got mass .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is the first take-home message of the talk ,COMMA which is that if you saw the beginning of this and you thought ,COMMA oh ,COMMA i'm totally going to go home and hire a capuchin monkey financial adviser .PERIOD <BREAK>
he believed that the crystal was the model for all kinds of representation .PERIOD <BREAK>
we are for decorative purposes only .PERIOD <BREAK>
and that's when it gets interesting ,COMMA when we start to crowdsource that information .PERIOD <BREAK>
it was three days ,COMMA four meals .PERIOD <BREAK>
in other words ,COMMA your perfect non-lethal weapon is something that's perfect for abuse .PERIOD <BREAK>
but not only that .PERIOD <BREAK>
you know ,COMMA it's heartening to me .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it's been a great motivator .PERIOD <BREAK>
my characters drove cars .PERIOD <BREAK>
and music ,COMMA of course .PERIOD just listening to music is good for you ,COMMA if it's music that's made with good intention ,COMMA made with love ,COMMA generally .PERIOD <BREAK>
bosnians ,COMMA croats and serbs find a rare shared space of pride in their history ,COMMA and lesbor reminds them that the songs one group often claims as theirs alone really belong to them all .PERIOD <BREAK>
this sort of behavior has been going on for three ,COMMA four ,COMMA five million years ,COMMA and we can't step in and say ,COMMA that's wrong ,COMMA and that's right .PERIOD <BREAK>
seismic standards and confined masonry ,COMMA where the building acts as a whole -- walls and columns and roofs and slabs tied together to support each other -- instead of breaking off into separate members and failing .PERIOD <BREAK>
because for me ,COMMA to join the b to the e ,COMMA i have to stop thinking about every single note along the way ,COMMA and start thinking about the long ,COMMA long line from b to e .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i just think that it's interesting that the idea of using real-world crashes ,COMMA which is very much something that economists think would be the right thing to do ,COMMA is something that scientists don't actually ,COMMA usually think -- they would rather use a laboratory ,COMMA a very imperfect science of looking at the dummies ,COMMA than actually <NUM> years of data of what we've seen with children and with car seats .PERIOD <BREAK>
but it stays an anecdote because the public couldn't identify to it .PERIOD <BREAK>
tribes can only hear one level above and below where they are .PERIOD <BREAK>
all right .PERIOD stay strong .PERIOD peace .PERIOD <BREAK>
i think that women in this part of the world realize that culture is an important component to connect people both locally and regionally .PERIOD <BREAK>
so with my friend marco ,COMMA we decided to go there and see who are the real palestinians and who are the real israelis .PERIOD <BREAK>
first ,COMMA we need to develop a global awareness campaign to inspire local communities and governments to create no-take reserves that are better than what we have now .PERIOD <BREAK>

he was a responsible husband and father .PERIOD <BREAK>
you can see these horrifying figures from africa .PERIOD <BREAK>
instantly ,COMMA you've found the links .PERIOD <BREAK>

last year there were a couple of kids from elite schools that came to ask for admissions in our school .PERIOD <BREAK>
not you .PERIOD not i .PERIOD <BREAK>
the brain isn't divided into compartments .PERIOD <BREAK>
because often we already have a very good treatment that is currently available ,COMMA so we don't want to know that your alternative new treatment is better than nothing .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's in that context that i rescue children .PERIOD <BREAK>
people do get hiv because they do stupid things ,COMMA but most of them are doing stupid things for perfectly rational reasons .PERIOD <BREAK>
and then we follow the process i've described .PERIOD <BREAK>
you've never really been sure of this ,COMMA but i can assure you that this quirk you're so self-conscious of is intensely endearing .PERIOD <BREAK>
he thought i was mad enough anyway .PERIOD <BREAK>
so by looking at things like clusters of galaxies ,COMMA and how they -- their number density ,COMMA how many there are as a function of time -- we can learn about how dark matter and dark energy compete against each other in structure forming .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i believe you'll get to the next step ,COMMA the real dream of listeners .PERIOD <BREAK>
that ,COMMA we get for free .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's the combination of strength ,COMMA extensibility and toughness that makes spider silk so special ,COMMA and that has attracted the attention of biomimeticists ,COMMA so people that turn to nature to try to find new solutions .PERIOD <BREAK>
so just as those airstreams are affected by the twists and turns in the instrument ,COMMA strings themselves will be affected by the vibrational patterns in the geometry within which they are moving .PERIOD <BREAK>
if you look at the triceratops ,COMMA you can see it's changing ,COMMA it's shape-shifting .PERIOD <BREAK>

don't move the wrist .PERIOD the wrist is -- i doesn't speak very many ,COMMA but i do the best ,COMMA what i are .PERIOD <BREAK>
it certainly didn't prepare me for what came next .PERIOD <BREAK>
because real science is all about critically appraising the evidence for somebody else's position .PERIOD <BREAK>
and that's a much bigger project ;SEMICOLON it's going to take <NUM> years or so to come to fruition .PERIOD <BREAK>
at first i was against it .PERIOD <BREAK>

can you tell us what you leaked and what happened ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and then you put in some randomness ,COMMA some fluctuations and some randomness ,COMMA and realize a whole bunch of different representations .PERIOD <BREAK>
look at what this does .PERIOD this is a simple piece of behavioral economics .PERIOD <BREAK>
but i'd like to go back to brunel here ,COMMA and suggest a connection that might explain why this is happening now ,COMMA and maybe why design thinking is a useful tool .PERIOD <BREAK>
but let's take the idea further .PERIOD <BREAK>
now we are able to follow them and find out their secrets ,COMMA where the babies go after they hatch ,COMMA and remarkable things like this you're about to see .PERIOD <BREAK>

we'd lay on top of that the soils and the waters ,COMMA and illuminate the landscape .PERIOD <BREAK>

scott simon ,COMMA who told this story on npr ,COMMA said ,COMMA rules and procedures may be dumb ,COMMA but they spare you from thinking .PERIOD <BREAK>

i mean ,COMMA whatever that is that kills the bird -- and i'm calling it a vacuum .PERIOD <BREAK>

and like ,COMMA there was big arguments about it in the -- you know ,COMMA the gin houses and in the coffee shops and stuff .PERIOD <BREAK>
i remember standing on the roof of the ministry of justice in downtown port-au-prince .PERIOD <BREAK>
but it's a bit more than cataloging because you actually have to describe and discover all the rules of communication ,COMMA the rules of connectivity ,COMMA because the neurons don't just like to connect with any neuron .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the brain then senses that there's an out-of-body experience .PERIOD <BREAK>
i had this i .PERIOD s .PERIOD officer's daughter ,COMMA who is <NUM> years old ,COMMA studying in ninth standard ,COMMA who was raped chatting with one individual ,COMMA and ran away from home because she wanted to become a heroine ,COMMA who was trafficked .PERIOD <BREAK>

but you also have the ability to allow the audience to see dallas ,COMMA to perform with dallas as the backdrop of your performance .PERIOD <BREAK>
last may ,COMMA i spent nine days living up in barrow ,COMMA alaska ,COMMA the northernmost settlement in the united states ,COMMA with a family of inupiat eskimos ,COMMA documenting their annual spring whale hunt .PERIOD <BREAK>

we have this incredible excess capacity .PERIOD <BREAK>

sometimes ,COMMA focusing on what's heroic ,COMMA beautiful and dignified ,COMMA regardless of the context ,COMMA can help magnify these intangibles three ways ,COMMA in the protagonist of the story ,COMMA in the audience ,COMMA and also in the storyteller .PERIOD <BREAK>

just cut the whole museum through the mountain -- enter from one side of the mountain ,COMMA come out on the other side of the mountain -- and then bring light through the mountain into the chambers .PERIOD <BREAK>

and so what that really means is that our structures now contain the blueprints of what we want to build .PERIOD <BREAK>
and yet from intergalactic space ,COMMA it's so far away you wouldn't even see it .PERIOD <BREAK>
so now i try and go after her ,COMMA but i’m practicing flying .PERIOD <BREAK>
in the developing world ,COMMA mobile phones have become economic drivers .PERIOD <BREAK>
the best way to test this is to actually create a model .PERIOD <BREAK>
but ,COMMA also ,COMMA there's going to be tremendous movement from the open to the closed .PERIOD <BREAK>
then another school said ,COMMA well ,COMMA what if we just give you a classroom and you can staff it all day ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and the same pattern emerged in each conflict .PERIOD <BREAK>
and you see where it ended in these various spring days ,COMMA june ,COMMA may ,COMMA then october .PERIOD <BREAK>
the people you're going to be shooting at aren't going to be able to get out of the way .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA technology is selfish ;SEMICOLON technology is generous .PERIOD <BREAK>
and you get to make these spot comparisons between people all around the globe .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is the right moment ,COMMA and this is the actual moment that we see all of these meanings meet together and then create the beginning of this magnificent era that will emerge from the region .PERIOD <BREAK>
so could art change the world ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
so i did what the current regime says i must do to be free to use youtube to talk about fair use .PERIOD <BREAK>

these are the people who are obsessed with something .PERIOD <BREAK>
we knew how brains see ,COMMA and how they control the body and how they hear and sense .PERIOD <BREAK>
most of the characteristic char-grilled taste doesn't come from the wood or the charcoal .PERIOD <BREAK>

okay .PERIOD so what we're going to do now is teach milo to skim stones .PERIOD <BREAK>
there was no agricultural productivity left .PERIOD <BREAK>
when that happens ,COMMA it is a trend which is set to overwhelm our policing capacity in the west .PERIOD <BREAK>
so you really can bring into a village ,COMMA and then the villages can connect themselves ,COMMA and you really can do it quite well .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is available on my website in english and spanish ,COMMA and it's a visual way to talk to kids about food .PERIOD <BREAK>

we have vast budget deficits .PERIOD <BREAK>

and here we asked some nearby pigs to do the titles for us .PERIOD <BREAK>
there's a lot of criteria by which we're selecting these brains .PERIOD <BREAK>
we just want to try and create that awareness because ,COMMA sure ,COMMA changing a light bulb isn't going to change the world ,COMMA but that attitude ,COMMA that awareness that leads you to change the light bulb or take your reusable coffee mug ,COMMA that is what could change the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
now ,COMMA to find dinosaurs ,COMMA you hike around in horrible conditions looking for a dinosaur .PERIOD <BREAK>
i find it such a profound one .PERIOD <BREAK>
and we continued .PERIOD <BREAK>
if you live only once ,COMMA in one-life cultures around the world ,COMMA you will see an obsession with binary logic ,COMMA absolute truth ,COMMA standardization ,COMMA absoluteness ,COMMA linear patterns in design .PERIOD <BREAK>
the power generation will come from the ocean itself .PERIOD <BREAK>
so it's a homeless pigeon now and it's going to have to find another place to live ,COMMA and that allows me to go through my catalog of favorite things ,COMMA and we start with the tall ones and so on .PERIOD <BREAK>
i just fell in love with the culture and the people .PERIOD <BREAK>
it took almost two years just to register the land .PERIOD <BREAK>
so this predicts that sensing the distances and directions of boundaries around you -- extended buildings and so on -- is particularly important for the hippocampus .PERIOD <BREAK>
this keyboard is probably actually the really wrong direction to go .PERIOD <BREAK>
not only is it a technological leap forward ,COMMA but i really do believe it's a bit of a cultural leap forward .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is called google info .PERIOD <BREAK>
and then we can enjoy our lives more fully without getting sick in the process .PERIOD <BREAK>
i was bottom of the class .PERIOD i haven't got any qualifications .PERIOD <BREAK>
for instance ,COMMA if you happen to be a <NUM> -year-old banker taking home <NUM> times more than a brain surgeon ,COMMA then you need a narrative ,COMMA you need a story that makes that disparity okay .PERIOD <BREAK>
i mean ,COMMA i'm an american .PERIOD i believe in free markets .PERIOD <BREAK>
and then these trendy young things in the sorbonne would say ,COMMA madame draupadi ,COMMA on n'est pas feministe ,COMMA mais ça ?QUESTIONMARK ça !EXCLAMATIONMARK <BREAK>

it's almost like they get heavy .PERIOD they get massive .PERIOD <BREAK>
we didn't know that pollution did more than cause bad visibility .PERIOD <BREAK>
i like to build stuff .PERIOD <BREAK>
these are all over the planet mars ,COMMA and we're busy cataloguing them now .PERIOD <BREAK>
but nasa is developing the space liner ,COMMA always has ,COMMA and runs the only space line ,COMMA ok .PERIOD and we've shied away from it because we're afraid of it .PERIOD but starting back in june of <NUM> ,COMMA when i showed that a little group out there actually can do it ,COMMA can get a start with it ,COMMA everything changed after that time .PERIOD <BREAK>
it broke up through atmospheric pressure ,COMMA it crumbled ,COMMA and then the pieces fell apart and did some damage .PERIOD <BREAK>
plato ,COMMA that's right .PERIOD <BREAK>
everybody who has looked at this and studied it agrees .PERIOD <BREAK>
we should talk about cancering as something we do ,COMMA not something we have .PERIOD <BREAK>
h stands for higgs particle .PERIOD <BREAK>
and he killed himself soon afterwards .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so there's about seven or eight cities already in the u .PERIOD s .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i'd add to that ,COMMA that it's not just making it ,COMMA but everybody ,COMMA each of us ,COMMA everybody in the world has the power to create and be part of music in a very dynamic way ,COMMA and that's one of the main parts of my work .PERIOD <BREAK>
because the owner said ,COMMA there's one billion dollars of beryllium in that mountain .PERIOD <BREAK>
so most everyone watches tv .PERIOD <BREAK>
you know ,COMMA the public policy will become more responsive to the needs of the poor ,COMMA and ,COMMA therefore i think it's okay .PERIOD <BREAK>
surely ,COMMA we should be giving the money to entrepreneurs ,COMMA to civil society ,COMMA for people able to create the new ,COMMA not to the big ,COMMA well-connected companies ,COMMA big ,COMMA clunky government programs .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA these are early examples in the lab of emerging technologies to digitize fabrication .PERIOD computers that don't control tools but computers that are tools ,COMMA where the output of a program rearranges atoms as well as bits .PERIOD <BREAK>
they weren't mistakes ;SEMICOLON i saw everything that i would have changed and i was embarrassed by it .PERIOD <BREAK>
let's have a look at this nice code that is coming from a renaissance book .PERIOD <BREAK>
so what can we actually do tomorrow ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
he subsequently got married again at <NUM> ,COMMA so he ,COMMA you know ,COMMA he had a lot of the life force in him .PERIOD <BREAK>
and we like to draw these tiles as little squares .PERIOD <BREAK>
we need four shoulder-high plants per person ,COMMA and in terms of plant care ,COMMA we need to wipe the leaves every day in delhi ,COMMA and perhaps once a week in cleaner-air cities .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i was thinking about how being with these extraordinary people on this particular panel that it's beneath ,COMMA beyond ,COMMA and between ,COMMA and the vagina kind of fits into all those categories .PERIOD <BREAK>
here ,COMMA a medical technician tends to a wounded soldier on the helicopter ride back to the field hospital .PERIOD <BREAK>
so we're going to have to go all-out thermonuclear response ,COMMA stimulate the total cytokine cascade .PERIOD <BREAK>
we've got to constrain income ,COMMA the bonus culture incomes at the top .PERIOD <BREAK>
politics is partly profane ,COMMA it's partly about self-interest ,COMMA but politics is also about sacredness .PERIOD <BREAK>
and what i found is that most companies and schools follow a formula for success ,COMMA which is this :COLON if i work harder ,COMMA i'll be more successful .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i don't think i need to tell you that the discovery of life elsewhere in our solar system ,COMMA whether it be on enceladus or elsewhere ,COMMA would have enormous cultural and scientific implications .PERIOD <BREAK>
it also looks very similar to some of the cave dwellings of the hopi people that are in that area .PERIOD <BREAK>
they could carry on without us .PERIOD <BREAK>
man :COLON so ,COMMA shreddies is actually producing a new product ,COMMA which is something very exciting for them .PERIOD <BREAK>
and here's another person in ,COMMA call it ,COMMA high school and college .PERIOD <BREAK>
bill gates put it very well when he was traveling through saudi arabia .PERIOD <BREAK>
the more you will rise ,COMMA the more you will be important for the civilization .PERIOD <BREAK>
and you know what changed his life ?QUESTIONMARK it was walking into one of these ,COMMA a boys and girls club .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the archetype of this in buddhism is avalokiteshvara ,COMMA kuan-yin .PERIOD <BREAK>
so i said ,COMMA yes ,COMMA a 'reverse fishing license .PERIOD ' so we walked away from this dinner really not knowing where to go at that point .PERIOD <BREAK>
we have to change it so that people have equal opportunity .PERIOD <BREAK>
first of all ,COMMA because these shapes are so complicated that one couldn't make any sense of the numbers .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's a way of squeezing an enormous amount of information and understanding into a small space .PERIOD <BREAK>
so i was a stickler for that .PERIOD i believed in that .PERIOD <BREAK>
his people live in brazil and in peru .PERIOD <BREAK>
but what you do need is a very big computer .PERIOD <BREAK>
and what would you say to ,COMMA for example ,COMMA the ,COMMA you know ,COMMA the parent of someone whose son is out serving the u .PERIOD s .PERIOD military ,COMMA and he says ,COMMA you know what ,COMMA you've put up something that someone had an incentive to put out .PERIOD <BREAK>
now you might wonder ,COMMA how do we make these cutaways ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
very little .PERIOD very little .PERIOD morphology and a lot of guesswork .PERIOD <BREAK>
they do great things for a few people who suffer from some specific condition ,COMMA but for most people ,COMMA they don't really transform what it is to be human .PERIOD <BREAK>
in a pre-internet world ,COMMA sovereignty over our physical freedoms ,COMMA or lack thereof ,COMMA was controlled almost entirely by nation-states .PERIOD <BREAK>
and if there is a struggle for life ,COMMA such that nearly all of these creatures die -- and this can't be doubted ,COMMA i've read malthus and i've calculated how long it would take for elephants to cover the whole world if they bred unrestricted ,COMMA and so on and so on .PERIOD <BREAK>
parthenogenesis ,COMMA [as it] was so called .PERIOD <BREAK>
but it's also relevant for disease and rehabilitation .PERIOD <BREAK>
stories are inevitable ,COMMA if they're good ,COMMA but they're not predictable .PERIOD <BREAK>
♫ gee ,COMMA that's swell .PERIOD i guess you're just my fatal attraction-ie .PERIOD you’re my clonie .PERIOD ♫ thank you .PERIOD <BREAK>
when the devil bites another devil ,COMMA it actually physically implants living cancer cells into the next devil ,COMMA so the tumor continues to grow .PERIOD <BREAK>
can everybody see ?QUESTIONMARK all right .PERIOD <BREAK>
i'm the only one who's left in india .PERIOD <BREAK>
now ,COMMA the model is intuitively right .PERIOD <BREAK>
ended up doing translation work at age <NUM> when i returned to the u .PERIOD s .PERIOD and have continued to apply this material over method approach to close to a dozen languages now .PERIOD <BREAK>
actually it sounded nice in the beginning ,COMMA but when you look at <NUM> summaries ,COMMA it's quite a lot .PERIOD <BREAK>
i have to drive trouble in the hills .PERIOD <BREAK>
because ,COMMA of course ,COMMA the bee thinks he's in charge or she's in charge ,COMMA but we know better .PERIOD <BREAK>
she is meant to have the power to look inside people and see the good and bad in everyone .PERIOD <BREAK>
and if you would like to know why i am not a father -- i ,COMMA who by a miracle have <NUM> godchildren -- the answer is in this poem ,COMMA which upsets me every time i read it .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA everything that i put into my body i considered as medicine .PERIOD <BREAK>
where do we find the most species of ocean life ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
but the real story starts when you wrap it around a book and put it on the shelf .PERIOD <BREAK>
how many of you have exceeded it ?QUESTIONMARK yeah ,COMMA i've certainly exceeded it .PERIOD <BREAK>
instead of saying ,COMMA you got <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> results .PERIOD <BREAK>
so why don't you do that now ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
as you get further and further away from the pump ,COMMA the deaths begin to grow less and less frequent .PERIOD <BREAK>
and to experience wonder is to experience awe .PERIOD <BREAK>
and all of them ,COMMA just like the prophets who get their message from god through gabriel ,COMMA get their message from above .PERIOD <BREAK>
and back in the <NUM> s ,COMMA when we wanted the money for the lhc from the u .PERIOD k .PERIOD government ,COMMA margaret thatcher ,COMMA at the time ,COMMA said ,COMMA if you guys can explain ,COMMA in language a politician can understand ,COMMA what the hell it is that you're doing ,COMMA you can have the money .PERIOD <BREAK>
so i would like to share this piece with you .PERIOD <BREAK>
slinky :COLON i'm sorry ,COMMA woody ,COMMA but i have to agree with them .PERIOD <BREAK>
i'm here today representing a team of artists and technologists and filmmakers that worked together on a remarkable film project for the last four years .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so i ask myself ,COMMA i'm starting to ask myself now ,COMMA even before this extreme dream gets achieved for me ,COMMA i'm asking myself ,COMMA and maybe i can ask you tonight too ,COMMA to paraphrase the poet mary oliver ,COMMA she says ,COMMA so what is it ,COMMA what is it you're doing ,COMMA with this one wild and precious life of yours ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
i need them in the morning .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's so simple ,COMMA so evocative .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it's good reason for them to be obsessed with the idea of universals ,COMMA because all of science ,COMMA through the <NUM> th century and much of the <NUM> th ,COMMA was obsessed with universals .PERIOD <BREAK>
so this is the leading killer of women .PERIOD <BREAK>
inter agency-ize it ,COMMA internationalize it .PERIOD <BREAK>
i mean ,COMMA astounding ;SEMICOLON no one has this .PERIOD <BREAK>
now ,COMMA of course there is a certain degree of ethnic allegiance ,COMMA but not entirely .PERIOD <BREAK>
why do you ,COMMA you know ,COMMA try to do this stuff ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
okay ,COMMA now if you want to play ,COMMA i want you to stand up ,COMMA okay ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
finally cingular said ok .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA here's the first story .PERIOD <BREAK>
apart from the awards it's won ,COMMA it's portable and it's certified .PERIOD it's registered ,COMMA the mhra -- and the ce mark ,COMMA for those who don't know ,COMMA for europe ,COMMA is the equivalent of the fda in the u .PERIOD s .PERIOD <BREAK>
the wiring from your sensory apparatus to those bits is shorter than the bits that have to pass through the thinky bit ,COMMA the cortex .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA like galois ,COMMA i stayed up all last night creating a new mathematical symmetrical object for you ,COMMA and i've got a picture of it here .PERIOD <BREAK>
things where you might trip across things like the copernican principle ,COMMA the fermi paradox ,COMMA the anthropic principle ,COMMA the origin of life .PERIOD <BREAK>
and we’re only just beginning to grasp it .PERIOD <BREAK>
and that ,COMMA of course ,COMMA that set back the progress of radio astronomy by about <NUM> years .PERIOD <BREAK>
here in britain ,COMMA i put out a call for british grandmothers ,COMMA after my kuppam experiment .PERIOD <BREAK>
number one :COLON this incursion into your land these past <NUM> years ,COMMA and before ,COMMA the reason anyone is interested in your land ,COMMA and particularly the united states ,COMMA it's oil .PERIOD <BREAK>
as a researcher ,COMMA every once in a while you encounter something a little disconcerting .PERIOD <BREAK>
there isn't any construction going on .PERIOD and so the sector shrivels away .PERIOD <BREAK>
about <NUM> grams of jellyfish equals four calories .PERIOD <BREAK>
i wish it would be easier ;SEMICOLON unfortunately it isn't .PERIOD <BREAK>
and they say ,COMMA oh ,COMMA yeah .PERIOD constant acceleration .PERIOD <BREAK>
it won't ,COMMA but it gives us a chance to study these kinds of asteroids .PERIOD we didn't really necessarily understand these keyholes ,COMMA and now we do and it turns out that's really important ,COMMA because how do you stop an asteroid like this ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and these are everyday conventions ,COMMA conventions that are so obvious that we are blinded by their familiarity .PERIOD <BREAK>
reading and writing is utterly useless .PERIOD <BREAK>
they're training their little kids to be soldiers for jesus .PERIOD <BREAK>
what if that wild bird flies by again ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
if it's not picked up by a human ,COMMA like me and you ,COMMA it'll stay there for thousands and thousands of years .PERIOD <BREAK>
that's what we need to do .PERIOD <BREAK>
it was that you knew you had to ,COMMA because ,COMMA in the late <NUM> s ,COMMA country after country in central europe was falling into the soviet bloc ,COMMA and so you knew you'd no choice .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is something no self-respecting photographer would ever do -- you put some cheesy illustration on your shot ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK -- and yet you have to do it sometimes to narrate these points .PERIOD <BREAK>
that's physical activity .PERIOD <BREAK>
and here is full scale -- it's a tiny bone .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA my closing thought .PERIOD <BREAK>
the beam splitters and lenses are represented by physical objects ,COMMA and the system projects down the laser beam path .PERIOD <BREAK>
we self-edit as we’re having ideas .PERIOD <BREAK>
but what we think is that ,COMMA under conditions of stress ,COMMA the levels of these hormones drop -- for example ,COMMA having limited food supply .PERIOD <BREAK>
the second main component of a closed-circuit rebreather is the gas system .PERIOD <BREAK>
we could ,COMMA of course ,COMMA buy more efficiency .PERIOD <BREAK>
or find expensive components from discarded electronics ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
earth witness would take this further ,COMMA linking what you see with what thousands or millions of other people see around the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
they get a little shorter at <NUM> a .PERIOD m .PERIOD <BREAK>
i was in high school and got a bad grade ,COMMA a rare event for me ,COMMA so i decided to hide it from my parents .PERIOD <BREAK>
statistical improbability in the direction of good design -- complexity is another word for this .PERIOD <BREAK>
you need to air out your pussy-cat .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so being able to move between those modes is really quite important .PERIOD so ,COMMA it’s where there’s a more nuanced version view of play ,COMMA i think ,COMMA is required .PERIOD <BREAK>
and down here ,COMMA child survival ,COMMA the percentage of children surviving childhood up to starting school :COLON <NUM> percent ,COMMA <NUM> percent ,COMMA <NUM> percent ,COMMA <NUM> ,COMMA and almost <NUM> percent ,COMMA as we have today in the wealthiest and healthiest countries .PERIOD <BREAK>
now they're not married ,COMMA and they want to go on to study further ,COMMA to have a career .PERIOD <BREAK>
nobody knows where they are .PERIOD <BREAK>
meat consumption increased five-fold .PERIOD <BREAK>
one is that the aliens might be very far away .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the challenge here is a building that will be green ,COMMA that is compact despite its size and is about the human experience of travel ,COMMA is about friendly ,COMMA is coming back to that starting point ,COMMA is very ,COMMA very much about the lifestyle .PERIOD <BREAK>
in that the shell was originally conceived as a lightweight ,COMMA modern ,COMMA futuristic ,COMMA high-tech pod for hurtling down the freeway ,COMMA and the interiors were completely out of sync with that .PERIOD <BREAK>
i think there is .PERIOD i just want to turn to a few of them .PERIOD <BREAK>
a quick bonus taboo for you ,COMMA that we should not be working together ,COMMA especially with three children -- and we are .PERIOD <BREAK>
if technologies don't last and persist ,COMMA we will not succeed .PERIOD <BREAK>
and in some areas ,COMMA the commercial gifting of an organ in exchange for monetary reward has led to a flourishing trade in living ,COMMA unrelated donors .PERIOD <BREAK>
thank you very much .PERIOD <BREAK>
i couldn't wait to prove the athlete i am ,COMMA that nobody else in the world can do this swim .PERIOD <BREAK>
it makes no odds .PERIOD in fact ,COMMA in the northern hemisphere ,COMMA we're further from the sun in summer ,COMMA as it happens ,COMMA but it makes no odds ,COMMA the difference .PERIOD <BREAK>
but one thing was curious :COLON most of those problems turn out to be problems that emerged later ,COMMA not from the very divine core of islam ,COMMA the koran ,COMMA but from ,COMMA again ,COMMA traditions and mentalities ,COMMA or the interpretations of the koran that muslims made in the middle ages .PERIOD <BREAK>
or something like this ,COMMA which is the lighting design he did for general motors ,COMMA for the car showroom .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is not the way they teach you to silver solder when you're in school .PERIOD <BREAK>
i've been studying chimpanzees in tanzania since <NUM> .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i always thought that was a very annie hall kind of outfit .PERIOD <BREAK>
at that point ,COMMA i became a little more ambitious and decided to see what else could children do with a computer .PERIOD <BREAK>
planning takes time .PERIOD and i'm proposing urban acupuncture .PERIOD <BREAK>
children live on things .PERIOD they live under things .PERIOD <BREAK>
no .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is our team in mozambique :COLON one tanzanian trainer ,COMMA who transfers the skills to these three mozambican fellows .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it turns out ,COMMA from our research ,COMMA that it boils down to survival -- survival for us and survival for our loved ones .PERIOD <BREAK>
and here's a line of text that actually evolves from the exhaust of a scooter zipping across the page .PERIOD <BREAK>
layma said to me later ,COMMA it's a taboo ,COMMA you know ,COMMA in west africa .PERIOD <BREAK>
a loud noise will get your fight-or-flight response going .PERIOD <BREAK>

one night ,COMMA when susan was seven months pregnant ,COMMA she started to experience contractions and was rushed to the emergency room .PERIOD <BREAK>
we talked about inertia and organ donations and checking the box .PERIOD <BREAK>
and in match me ,COMMA you take the class ,COMMA divide it into two teams ,COMMA one team on each side of the playground ,COMMA and the teacher will take a piece of chalk and just write a number on each of the tires .PERIOD <BREAK>
to reiterate the point ,COMMA let's go closer into iluvatar .PERIOD <BREAK>

however ,COMMA there was another case ,COMMA the eastland ,COMMA a ship that capsized in chicago harbor in <NUM> ,COMMA and it killed <NUM> people -- that was <NUM> more than the passenger toll of the titanic .PERIOD <BREAK>
after we were pretty much convinced we had a good design ,COMMA and we'd have to make all the standard engineering trade-offs you always make -- you can always get three out of four of anything you want ;SEMICOLON the weight ,COMMA the size ,COMMA the cost ,COMMA the functionality -- i put a bunch of guys in my plane and i said ,COMMA we're flying down to walter reed ,COMMA and we're going talk to these kids ,COMMA because frankly it doesn't matter whether we like this arm .PERIOD <BREAK>
steve wozniak invented the first apple computer sitting alone in his cubical in hewlett-packard where he was working at the time .PERIOD <BREAK>
you may not have lots of data which you have yourself to put on there but you know to demand it .PERIOD <BREAK>
i'm a bug lover ,COMMA myself -- not from childhood ,COMMA by the way ,COMMA but rather late .PERIOD <BREAK>
so to begin to answer these questions ,COMMA we did a research study .PERIOD <BREAK>
and feminists hated us ,COMMA and the whole thing was wretched from beginning to end .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i'm now giving you a wider picture than the mdg .PERIOD <BREAK>
oh ,COMMA my god !EXCLAMATIONMARK <BREAK>
so in closing ,COMMA i said i want to close by a couple of pictures .PERIOD <BREAK>
the first one was that when helium atoms touch each other ,COMMA they repel .PERIOD <BREAK>
even those mundane ,COMMA hateful ,COMMA plastic grocery bags can become a bridge stronger than anyone imagined .PERIOD <BREAK>
in fact ,COMMA one of the ways to make money in second life is to make really cool translators that you drag onto your body and they basically ,COMMA kind of ,COMMA pop up on your screen and allow you to use google or babel fish or one of the other online text translators to on-the-fly translate spoken -- i'm sorry -- typed text between individuals .PERIOD <BREAK>

this is not the matrix .PERIOD you can only do this to yourself .PERIOD you take control .PERIOD <BREAK>
that's amazing parallel and distributed computing power ,COMMA new design possibilities .PERIOD <BREAK>
we have absolutely no idea what that would do .PERIOD <BREAK>
want to publish globally anything you think today ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and ghana was not paying enough attention .PERIOD <BREAK>
and you can see on this figure ,COMMA that the frequency range and the decibel range ,COMMA the dynamic range of music is far more heterogeneous .PERIOD <BREAK>
and you always think you might have some legacy you can leave the world behind .PERIOD <BREAK>
and yet ,COMMA what we actually see is light that can't be explained by the starlight .PERIOD <BREAK>
so the problem is that measuring -- if you try to measure all the proteins ,COMMA it's a very elaborate process .PERIOD <BREAK>
and whilst i'm painting i have to be very careful ,COMMA because the paint starts to turn into little blobs .PERIOD <BREAK>
i grew up herding ,COMMA looking after our livestock -- goats ,COMMA sheep and cattle .PERIOD <BREAK>
at this very moment ,COMMA you are viewing my upper half .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's not an idea .PERIOD it's not equivalent to anything else ,COMMA really .PERIOD <BREAK>

it's said that something like <NUM> percent of the four million dollars that was taken to fund <NUM> / <NUM> actually passed through the institutions of the twin towers which <NUM> / <NUM> destroyed .PERIOD <BREAK>
one is under construction by the chinese and the other <NUM> belong to us .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i'm a very small part of this .PERIOD <BREAK>
and if it isn't then it produces a shape which is very phonaesthetically tightly coupled to the sounds you made .PERIOD <BREAK>
and then what we get is our first mapping .PERIOD <BREAK>
all right .PERIOD tap them together once .PERIOD <BREAK>
and then work later is going to take us to tibet .PERIOD <BREAK>
you know ,COMMA i am so bad at tech that my daughter -- who is now <NUM> -- when she was five ,COMMA was overheard by me to say to a friend of hers ,COMMA if it doesn't bleed when you cut it ,COMMA my daddy doesn't understand it .PERIOD <BREAK>

this year's swine flu strain grew very poorly in early production :COLON basically .PERIOD <NUM> doses per egg .PERIOD <BREAK>
the first time the possibility for independence was discussed was in <NUM> ,COMMA following the aba women's market riots .PERIOD <BREAK>
and there'd be that sound in the signal -- it's like -- and he thought ,COMMA oh ,COMMA what if i could control that sound and turn it into an instrument ,COMMA because there are pitches in it .PERIOD <BREAK>
so they looked at the young and the restless ,COMMA and it wasn't that ,COMMA either .PERIOD <BREAK>
so we audit .PERIOD <BREAK>
on the other hand ,COMMA we have someone like ted bundy ;SEMICOLON ted bundy was very fond of abducting and raping and torturing and killing young women .PERIOD <BREAK>
reading the newspaper -- it never has to be outdated .PERIOD <BREAK>

all it requires is to recognize among us ,COMMA every day -- the few of us that can see -- are surrounded by people like the ones i've told you .PERIOD <BREAK>
that was a very moving piece .PERIOD <BREAK>
you can distribute bed nets ,COMMA and bed nets are very effective if you use them .PERIOD <BREAK>
you have to probably stop .PERIOD maybe not come to a grinding halt ,COMMA but you've got to sort of find that mouse .PERIOD then you find the mouse ,COMMA and you're going to have to wiggle it a little bit to see where the cursor is on the screen .PERIOD <BREAK>
and they don't perceive even those as what they really are ,COMMA namely electrical crackles .PERIOD <BREAK>
manias can be alarming .PERIOD <BREAK>
instead of shipping water ,COMMA and using man-made processes to do it ,COMMA let's use mother nature .PERIOD she's got a fantastic system .PERIOD <BREAK>
but the dutch people here will understand what i mean .PERIOD <BREAK>
samuel clemens ,COMMA mark twain ,COMMA was a big investor in the most complex machine of all times -- at least until <NUM> -- registered with the u .PERIOD s .PERIOD patent office .PERIOD <BREAK>
i assure you if it happens ,COMMA at the end ,COMMA both the west and the muslim world will have suffered .PERIOD <BREAK>

star fox <NUM> ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>

poor countries need aid .PERIOD <BREAK>
you can see the bars of the window there .PERIOD <BREAK>
it was technologists and humanists at that big bibliotech conference .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's the female trend ,COMMA and it's the sustainability trend ,COMMA that are going to create some of the most interesting investment opportunities in the years to come .PERIOD <BREAK>
we started with a natural occurring clay called montmorillonite .PERIOD <BREAK>
you can exploit this to make sure that only some neurons contain our light-activated pore and others don't .PERIOD <BREAK>

would you like kim jong-il ,COMMA who's killed about two million people ,COMMA would you like him gone ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
it runs down the rivers ,COMMA and it feeds the plankton ,COMMA the little microscopic plant cells in the coastal water .PERIOD <BREAK>
it was a very small village -- a weekly bazaar where people ,COMMA just once in a week ,COMMA they put in all the vats .PERIOD <BREAK>

it is a huge benefit .PERIOD <BREAK>
and as a special treat ,COMMA he took me to the pathology lab and took a real human brain out of the jar and placed it in my hands .PERIOD <BREAK>

because all those people were made up of people who ,COMMA for the most part ,COMMA considered each other enemies .PERIOD <BREAK>
the empires weren't all bad .PERIOD <BREAK>
and here you can see it's rotating about the vertical axis only ,COMMA creating circles .PERIOD <BREAK>
i thought in getting up to my ted wish i would try to begin by putting in perspective what i try to do and how it fits with what they try to do .PERIOD <BREAK>
in other countries there is protection for our artful designs .PERIOD <BREAK>
and this has been invaluable in our approach to try to study these things .PERIOD <BREAK>
and that made a huge impact on me when i was doing this research .PERIOD <BREAK>
what if ,COMMA plato thought ,COMMA ethics was like math ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
where they have the same kind of security to take risks .PERIOD <BREAK>
but when you exercise them ,COMMA any given muscle adds strength to the whole system and that applies to your brain too .PERIOD <BREAK>

that's why in june of this year ,COMMA we passed ,COMMA as a species ,COMMA <NUM> percent of us living in cities ,COMMA and bustees ,COMMA and slums ,COMMA and shantytowns .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is ,COMMA i think ,COMMA the range that matters .PERIOD <BREAK>
about half of them ,COMMA <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> ,COMMA have permanent damage to their heart that will cause them to have very bad problems later on .PERIOD <BREAK>
it is the central psychological plague of humankind in the <NUM> st century .PERIOD <BREAK>

now i'm her competitor for the audience .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i still do get to keep in touch with my mother and father ,COMMA albeit infrequently .PERIOD <BREAK>
and then you slowly build up a theory of how this stuff works .PERIOD <BREAK>
so really ,COMMA we're going to remind ourselves that decision is the ultimate power .PERIOD that's what it really is .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the forces of convergence exploded .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA it was always like ,COMMA they called me kid david ,COMMA because i was the kid .PERIOD <BREAK>
on the high wire ,COMMA within months ,COMMA i'm able to master all the tricks they do in the circus ,COMMA except i am not satisfied .PERIOD <BREAK>

or perhaps he was just a yogi who was sitting on a rock ,COMMA staring at the sky and the sun and the moon .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's a polymathematical website .PERIOD <BREAK>
so i took the approach that the chair should do as much for them as humanly possible or as mechanistically possible so that they didn't have to fuss with it .PERIOD <BREAK>
that's exactly how it happens .PERIOD <BREAK>
and on sunday ,COMMA june <NUM> th at <NUM> -- this was actually about two o'clock in the afternoon in skowhegan ,COMMA maine -- this was my apartment there .PERIOD <BREAK>

country <NUM> has a systematic advantage over country <NUM> in infrastructures .PERIOD <BREAK>
i was imagining it was like <NUM> percent when i first started .PERIOD <BREAK>

that's something on the order of <NUM> .PERIOD <NUM> billion u .PERIOD s .PERIOD dollars on translation costs alone .PERIOD <BREAK>
thank you .PERIOD <BREAK>

and there is a way the world both envisions food ,COMMA the way the world writes about food and learns about food .PERIOD <BREAK>

first of all ,COMMA you have to edit ruthlessly .PERIOD <BREAK>
so we're left with a situation where we know that our earliest ancestors were moving around on four legs in the trees ,COMMA before the savanna ecosystem even came into existence .PERIOD <BREAK>
our cultural imagination about compassion has been deadened by idealistic images .PERIOD <BREAK>
plants are not living creatures -- this is the point .PERIOD <BREAK>

it's kind of out past mars .PERIOD it's a hike .PERIOD <BREAK>
but the great change came ,COMMA of course ,COMMA with globalization and deregulation .PERIOD <BREAK>
but it was the countries that wanted it to go up ,COMMA and we let them push it up for all sorts of reasons .PERIOD so what you can do -- i've just said it .PERIOD don't just give one ,COMMA get one .PERIOD <BREAK>
so i say to tony ,COMMA sorry ,COMMA but it's worse than you think .PERIOD <BREAK>

already ,COMMA around the arctic circle -- this is a famous village in alaska .PERIOD this is a town in newfoundland .PERIOD antarctica .PERIOD latest studies from nasa .PERIOD <BREAK>

what he said ,COMMA that all too often ,COMMA is that we accept the distance between those two ideas .PERIOD <BREAK>
life is a string of choices creating a constant pressure to decide what to do next .PERIOD <BREAK>
and we're getting great reports back from corporate ghana ,COMMA corporate west africa ,COMMA and the things that they're most impressed about is work ethic .PERIOD <BREAK>
now ,COMMA the balance that i try to fight for ,COMMA i ,COMMA as any good liberal ,COMMA try to fight for first by looking to the government .PERIOD total mistake ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>

all those other values ,COMMA all those pages and pages of values that are full of nothing ,COMMA we summarize .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i am going to show you multiple applications in the medical field that can be enabled just by focusing ,COMMA physically focusing .PERIOD <BREAK>

governments snatch short-term opportunities and ,COMMA by the end of the conflict ,COMMA the chickens have come home to roost .PERIOD <BREAK>
so where are we going to get this information ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>

byte magazine and communications at the acm had special issues covering hypertext .PERIOD <BREAK>
the only problem is to fit it into the machine .PERIOD <BREAK>

and we knew it was volcanic back in the ' <NUM> s ,COMMA ' <NUM> s .PERIOD <BREAK>
oh ,COMMA it's so fabulous !EXCLAMATIONMARK <BREAK>
because it is in stage three that many of us move .PERIOD <BREAK>

and we were the first non-muslims to teach in the state schools there in kuwait .PERIOD <BREAK>
all right ,COMMA for good measure ,COMMA that's where nigeria is on the african map ,COMMA and just there is the delta region that i'm sure everybody's heard of .PERIOD <BREAK>

everyone in the world respects nelson mandela ,COMMA everyone reveres nelson mandela .PERIOD <BREAK>

guy :COLON where did you guys get those ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
you do that because ,COMMA <NUM> years before ,COMMA an airborne sergeant had taught me to do that .PERIOD <BREAK>
a scuffle ensues and you get stabbed with one of your own arrowheads .PERIOD <BREAK>
so if you think about it ,COMMA the world hasn't stopped either .PERIOD <BREAK>

so he wrote a program to take the data ,COMMA extract it from wikipedia ,COMMA and put it into a blob of linked data on the web ,COMMA which he called dbpedia .PERIOD <BREAK>
we've got another <NUM> minutes .PERIOD <BREAK>
one of them ,COMMA from anthropology ,COMMA is the study of human universals .PERIOD <BREAK>

we do not have the basis of a proper partnership for the future ,COMMA and yet ,COMMA out of people’s desire for a global ethic and a global society that can be done .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it turned out that -- i just went to see ,COMMA you know ,COMMA what they are doing in hong kong .PERIOD <BREAK>

and you know ,COMMA we have a society ,COMMA a world ,COMMA that is paralyzed by fear .PERIOD <BREAK>
for me it may be :COLON every calorie you consume ,COMMA you conserve ,COMMA because i come from a very cold climate .PERIOD <BREAK>
because of this ,COMMA commodity buyers and sellers typically transact in small circles ,COMMA in narrow networks of people they know and trust .PERIOD <BREAK>

these are crinoids ,COMMA sponges ,COMMA black corals .PERIOD there're some more fishes .PERIOD <BREAK>
even when on its worst behavior ,COMMA i find myself automatically defending the usa from the sneers of green-eyed europhiles playing their greek card to roman trumps .PERIOD <BREAK>

it is this chemistry that makes oil so disastrous .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so with that ,COMMA coming to a -- coming to an operating theater near you soon ,COMMA i believe .PERIOD <BREAK>
it was all coming into my laptop and cell phone .PERIOD <BREAK>
the pattern is that those people ,COMMA every one of them i looked at ,COMMA who was a murderer ,COMMA and was a serial killer ,COMMA had damage to their orbital cortex ,COMMA which is right above the eyes ,COMMA the orbits ,COMMA and also the interior part of the temporal lobe .PERIOD <BREAK>
what we have extant right now ,COMMA at the beginning of this system ,COMMA is the u .PERIOD n .PERIOD security council as a grand jury .PERIOD <BREAK>
and that constant is the speed of sound .PERIOD <BREAK>
what africa is providing is a diversification play ,COMMA and also opportunities for yield pickup for the investor that's aware of what he or she is doing .PERIOD <BREAK>

i started meditating on that and created a restaurant called waterhouse .PERIOD <BREAK>
so literally ,COMMA you think about a rope .PERIOD it has very complex structure in the weave .PERIOD <BREAK>

solar manifesto by hermann scheer ,COMMA in germany ,COMMA claims all energy on earth can be derived ,COMMA for every country ,COMMA from solar energy and water ,COMMA and so on .PERIOD <BREAK>

paul worked for years on the cameroonian national radio and television ,COMMA and he spoke about health issues .PERIOD he was a health correspondent .PERIOD <BREAK>
basically ,COMMA i celebrated every religious function .PERIOD <BREAK>
so he thought ,COMMA why don't i convert a pressure cooker into a coffee machine ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and it was very important for us to establish the exact moment that it would fall ,COMMA because if we made it in a way that it would topple over ,COMMA then it would damage itself ,COMMA and if it didn't fall enough ,COMMA it wouldn't instill that fatalism ,COMMA or that sense of wanting to go and help it .PERIOD <BREAK>
i think it's about having to be prepared as communities ,COMMA not as individuals -- being prepared as nation ,COMMA being prepared as state ,COMMA being prepared as town .PERIOD <BREAK>

so this sort of thing needs to be brought into notice ,COMMA for patients ,COMMA for doctors ,COMMA for the public .PERIOD <BREAK>
and we might think of these as abandoned .PERIOD <BREAK>
and at least until they're <NUM> ,COMMA we're still popping those worms into those little open mouths .PERIOD <BREAK>
my measure of this as being an important bit of design is not so much the way that it looks ,COMMA but the fact that it performs a very important social function .PERIOD <BREAK>

if ,COMMA for instance ,COMMA i didn't want you to look at my right hand ,COMMA well ,COMMA then ,COMMA i don't look at it .PERIOD <BREAK>
but in fact ,COMMA if you look around the world ,COMMA not only are there hope spots for where we may be able to fix problems ,COMMA there have been places where problems have been fixed ,COMMA where people have come to grips with these issues and begun to turn them around .PERIOD <BREAK>
he explained to them that it was not a question of survival of the fittest ;SEMICOLON it was a question of understanding what they needed to survive and to protect that .PERIOD <BREAK>

so i want to talk about ,COMMA i want to shift now to think about how we deliver health information in this country ,COMMA how we actually get information .PERIOD <BREAK>
it helps us become what we might have been .PERIOD <BREAK>
you can smell bakery air ,COMMA walk around with rain hair ,COMMA pop bubble wrap or take an illegal nap .PERIOD <BREAK>

these are things that are getting into our food chain because of these blooms .PERIOD <BREAK>
the solution is that these constructions ,COMMA despite initial appearance ,COMMA are not synonymous ,COMMA that when you crank up the microscope on human cognition ,COMMA you see that there's a subtle difference in meaning between them .PERIOD <BREAK>
in australia they did it -- this research company ,COMMA called symbiotica .PERIOD <BREAK>

they wanted us to think critically .PERIOD <BREAK>
thank you .PERIOD <BREAK>
so it's maybe not surprising he thinks it was mean of ivan to take joshua's sandwich ,COMMA since he thinks ivan only took joshua's sandwich to avoid having to eat his own dirty sandwich .PERIOD <BREAK>
cochineal is a product of an insect that lives off these cacti .PERIOD <BREAK>

so to make matters even more difficult ,COMMA it's a very young planet .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it feels historic .PERIOD it tries to create a sense that this is a historic opportunity to do something really extraordinary .PERIOD <BREAK>
we heard there was a woman doctor who was treating people .PERIOD <BREAK>
not long after it came out ,COMMA augusten was waylaid in an airport and he was hiding out in the bookstore spying on who was buying his books .PERIOD <BREAK>

north korea did that to some extent .PERIOD <BREAK>
what happened next was remarkable ,COMMA and it's where our cylinder enters the story .PERIOD <BREAK>
this picture is the hallmark of censorship in the book record .PERIOD <BREAK>
i left late today .PERIOD i'd hoped to be here yesterday ,COMMA because my father-in-law is in his last ,COMMA probably ,COMMA <NUM> hours before he dies of cancer .PERIOD <BREAK>
let's not forget these men ,COMMA who are truly dying to work .PERIOD <BREAK>

that changes our climate .PERIOD <BREAK>
shake your hands out .PERIOD <BREAK>
at the risk of admission ,COMMA i was never nicer than the year i was on crutches .PERIOD <BREAK>

who sees it all ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and then i asked myself the question .PERIOD <BREAK>
the reason that it's so important is that ,COMMA the last decade ,COMMA what we've seen has been building the social layer ,COMMA has been this framework for connections ,COMMA and construction on that layer is over ,COMMA it's finished .PERIOD <BREAK>
i'm scared and i'm angry .PERIOD and then she turned to me and said ,COMMA dad ,COMMA your generation created this problem ;SEMICOLON you'd better fix it .PERIOD wow .PERIOD <BREAK>
and ,COMMA very surprisingly ,COMMA over half of them had ,COMMA actually ,COMMA something to do with design .PERIOD <BREAK>
it is a lot more sophisticated than a microwave oven ,COMMA but it is basically boiling the water molecules in the very surface level of your skin .PERIOD <BREAK>
i never deal with images .PERIOD <BREAK>
and ,COMMA you know ,COMMA if the sound isn't there ,COMMA the sale typically isn't made .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so the first step is to realize that we can do this together ,COMMA and that there is no us and them .PERIOD <BREAK>
and there it is kind of grown ,COMMA at least one particular section of it .PERIOD <BREAK>
that is the consequence of more than a third of the right side of my brain being destroyed by the stroke .PERIOD <BREAK>
nonsense .PERIOD <BREAK>
chris anderson :COLON thank you ,COMMA thank you .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is about my friend brennan .PERIOD <BREAK>

<NUM> was a great year .PERIOD <BREAK>
they grow <NUM> meters long .PERIOD <BREAK>
this light up here is the same light that occurs in every middle-class foyer in america .PERIOD <BREAK>

we have been dealing with a similarly very weak feature ,COMMA which belongs to osmium .PERIOD <BREAK>
imagine being able to make perfect lenses .PERIOD <BREAK>
this went on about six or seven times ,COMMA and we were getting more and more alarmed ,COMMA and we were also getting deeper and deeper into the desert .PERIOD <BREAK>
hence ,COMMA you could share some of your nutritional resources instead of monopolizing them .PERIOD <BREAK>
and all of these things combine to create an enormous amount of torque on the planet .PERIOD <BREAK>
so this problem is absolutely soluble .PERIOD <BREAK>
one of the most dramatic manifestations of these improvements will be moving from population pyramids to what we might term population coffins .PERIOD <BREAK>
nature ,COMMA city .PERIOD nothing changes .PERIOD <BREAK>
that gets your adrenaline going .PERIOD <BREAK>
these are her symbols on her keyboard .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so i never developed the ability to have a staff .PERIOD <BREAK>
i can get a definition of these words just by touching them ,COMMA and the definition will appear in the illustration corner .PERIOD <BREAK>
it failed partly because the courts are too passive ,COMMA partly because the legislatures are corrupted ,COMMA by which i don't mean that there's bribery operating to stop real change ,COMMA but more the economy of influence that governs how congress functions means that policymakers here will not understand this until it's too late to fix it .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it's not a trip that requires light-years of travel ,COMMA but it's to a place where it's defined by light .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it works perfectly on its test range ,COMMA and it indeed folds up into a neat little bundle .PERIOD <BREAK>
and these are the so-called developing countries .PERIOD <BREAK>
so government needs to make us do something painful to fix it .PERIOD <BREAK>
bright as a button .PERIOD all the ducks in a row .PERIOD <BREAK>
we all have these .PERIOD <BREAK>
none of the things you will see in this particular video are trained .PERIOD <BREAK>

somewhere hidden in the physical gestures ,COMMA the vocal cadence ,COMMA the facial expressions ,COMMA the eye contact ,COMMA the passion ,COMMA the kind of awkward ,COMMA british body language ,COMMA the sense of how the audience are reacting ,COMMA there are hundreds of subconscious clues that go to how well you will understand ,COMMA and whether you're inspired -- light ,COMMA if you like ,COMMA and desire .PERIOD <BREAK>
well ,COMMA neurons ,COMMA like trees ,COMMA can grow new branches ,COMMA and they can lose old ones .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the cloudbook doesn't have any storage .PERIOD <BREAK>
and that's great for the company ,COMMA and it's quite often great for the minister -- -- and it's not great for their country .PERIOD <BREAK>
and this is a systematic error people make .PERIOD <BREAK>
the worry is about antidepressants .PERIOD <BREAK>
there's really no ceremony ,COMMA rituals ,COMMA or rites .PERIOD <BREAK>
the problem is ,COMMA there are many ,COMMA many feet .PERIOD <BREAK>

this is dr .PERIOD kang who's been working with us on this project ,COMMA and part of our team .PERIOD <BREAK>

i was like ,COMMA let me think about this for a second .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i love sake and kobe and all that stuff .PERIOD <BREAK>
so premise one is we'd be destroying the world ,COMMA and then premise two is ,COMMA why don't we get prepared for it ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
as a child ,COMMA i was raised by native hawaiian elders -- three old women who took care of me while my parents worked .PERIOD <BREAK>

zero is zero ,COMMA a little hero of the <NUM> st century ,COMMA and zero can touch so many more people than i possibly could .PERIOD <BREAK>

richard kelly saw it as something infinite ,COMMA something without any focus ,COMMA something where all details actually dissolve in infinity .PERIOD <BREAK>
penguins are very vocal birds and really ,COMMA really noisy .PERIOD <BREAK>

the managers and the security guards ,COMMA on the other hand ,COMMA did not find it particularly funny .PERIOD <BREAK>

this is my big wish .PERIOD <BREAK>
rather than preceding the insurgency ,COMMA the taliban followed the troop deployment ,COMMA and as far as i'm concerned ,COMMA the troop deployment caused their return .PERIOD <BREAK>
but apparently somebody blew it ,COMMA because the lamanites were able to kill all the nephites .PERIOD <BREAK>
so it doesn't really make sense at all .PERIOD <BREAK>
bill gates ,COMMA fortunately ,COMMA has bet a billion on [agricultural] research .PERIOD <BREAK>

but the green building ,COMMA on behind ,COMMA you can see that the top floor is not occupied ,COMMA so people are building with the possibility of expansion .PERIOD <BREAK>
but no doubt part of this was his great joy and pleasure in showing people that he could think more simply than they could .PERIOD <BREAK>
i couldn't develop the attributes in my toes ,COMMA the strength in my feet ,COMMA to do that .PERIOD <BREAK>
and remember ,COMMA to create a place of character and quality ,COMMA you have to be able to define space .PERIOD <BREAK>
you'll discover compassion and also slowly a relative compassion ,COMMA and slowly ,COMMA perhaps if you get the right teaching ,COMMA you'll discover compassion is a dynamic manifestation of the reality of yourself ,COMMA which is oneness ,COMMA wholeness ,COMMA and that's what you are .PERIOD <BREAK>
when i was born ,COMMA the world's population was <NUM> .PERIOD <NUM> billion people .PERIOD <BREAK>
now if these inequalities ,COMMA climate and war can be avoided ,COMMA get ready for a world in equity ,COMMA because this is what seems to be happening .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's just a question to use some techniques like the time lapse .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is a man who terrorized the very vicinity we're in many years ago .PERIOD he was known as the santa cruz strangler .PERIOD <BREAK>

so ,COMMA imagine i have a plank about two feet wide and <NUM> feet long and i'm going to walk on it ,COMMA and you see i can walk on it without looking ,COMMA i can go back and forth and i can jump up and down .PERIOD <BREAK>
so i started to see the world in a completely new way and i became obsessed with this .PERIOD <BREAK>
you know ,COMMA you go to a restaurant ,COMMA you eat fish ,COMMA i got news for you ,COMMA it's all farmed .PERIOD you know ,COMMA you gotta ask when you go to a restaurant if it's a wild fish ,COMMA cause they're not going to tell you .PERIOD we're giving away the code .PERIOD <BREAK>

we are focused on making this technology better .PERIOD <BREAK>
and he said ,COMMA well ,COMMA we should meet first ,COMMA before we decide anything .PERIOD <BREAK>
this one is one that will spoke out ,COMMA and will go out ,COMMA and to start reaching .PERIOD because right now there's conversations in india ,COMMA in china ,COMMA in south america -- there's entries coming from all around the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
right ,COMMA the current wants to run through the play-dough ,COMMA not through that led .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i think this isn't <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> years out .PERIOD <BREAK>
thank you .PERIOD thank you .PERIOD <BREAK>
but more importantly ,COMMA it spoke of a deeper yearning ,COMMA something far more sophisticated than hunting magic .PERIOD <BREAK>
i've already talked about that to chris and amy ,COMMA and they said that there's a problem with this .PERIOD <BREAK>
he's seeing his own brain .PERIOD <BREAK>
he's got no legs .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the reality is that the further away you are from that ,COMMA you're a few microseconds behind every time .PERIOD <BREAK>

audience :COLON yeah !EXCLAMATIONMARK <BREAK>
this lets you do it .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is his chart ,COMMA which is not quite published yet .PERIOD <BREAK>

we call it a complex system ,COMMA which it is ,COMMA but it's also something else .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's not fair for me ;SEMICOLON it's not fair for my country .PERIOD <BREAK>
because ultimately ,COMMA that electoral outcome had nothing to do with the rest of the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA i see this ,COMMA scribble everything down ,COMMA draw things ,COMMA and i go to bed .PERIOD <BREAK>
all my creations really start on small drawings ,COMMA which i have thousands of ,COMMA and it's my way of just thinking .PERIOD <BREAK>
because you've agreed on <NUM> percent of things ,COMMA because you have a shared view on so many things ,COMMA and you politely differ .PERIOD <BREAK>
it became a killer app of links ,COMMA and today ,COMMA of course ,COMMA we call that the world wide web .PERIOD <BREAK>
ok ,COMMA swap them around ,COMMA put your right hand up .PERIOD <BREAK>
because it worked .PERIOD <BREAK>
this means that although for hundreds ,COMMA perhaps thousands of years ,COMMA people have lived in those forests ,COMMA or whatever habitat it is ,COMMA in harmony with their world ,COMMA just killing the animals they need for themselves and their families -- now ,COMMA suddenly ,COMMA because of the roads ,COMMA the hunters can go in from the towns .PERIOD <BREAK>
now i'm not a scientist ,COMMA but i was accompanying a remarkable scientific team from the university of south florida who have been tracking the travels of bp's oil in the gulf of mexico .PERIOD <BREAK>
after all ,COMMA the best education -- according to the latest world university rankings -- is to be found in the universities of the u .PERIOD k .PERIOD and the u .PERIOD s .PERIOD <BREAK>
i'm always trying to find the best way to tell each story .PERIOD <BREAK>
i mean ,COMMA if you want an illustration of this ,COMMA the great wall is one .PERIOD <BREAK>
how can we get away from the mouse and use our full bodies as a way of exploring aesthetic experiences ,COMMA not necessarily utilitarian ones .PERIOD <BREAK>
in this picture ,COMMA you'll notice ,COMMA the bang is extended .PERIOD it's not a point .PERIOD <BREAK>
we have opportunities in solid minerals .PERIOD we have a lot of minerals that no one has even invested in or explored .PERIOD and we realized that without the proper legislation to make that possible ,COMMA that wouldn't happen .PERIOD so we've now got a mining code that is comparable with some of the best in the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
i directly run to my home office ,COMMA sit at my computer ,COMMA i type in the ideas ,COMMA i sketch things out and i keep a database of ideas .PERIOD <BREAK>
the bank was profitable .PERIOD <BREAK>
so we are working now on a non-invasive -- again ,COMMA these are all invasive studies .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i caught the guys ,COMMA and they turned out to be working for what was then the soviet kgb ,COMMA and stealing information and selling it .PERIOD <BREAK>
well now there's essentially a virtual colonoscopy .PERIOD <BREAK>
you're not paid to change size class .PERIOD <BREAK>
but she also found osteocytes ,COMMA which are the cells that laid down the bones .PERIOD <BREAK>
a lot of hurdles .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA for example ,COMMA here is a real network of college students at an elite northeastern university .PERIOD <BREAK>
no pavement .PERIOD <BREAK>
just know where i came from ,COMMA why i did the jugaad .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the grandmother had never let any westerners ever see her .PERIOD <BREAK>
i mean that's the essence of it all .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is the initiative that's been coordinated by conservation international with a variety of partners and governments to actually try to bring integrated management regime throughout the area .PERIOD <BREAK>
because when you take out that last piece of gold -- and they did incredibly quickly .PERIOD i mean ,COMMA if you look at the <NUM> gold rush -- the entire american river region ,COMMA within two years -- every stone had been turned .PERIOD and after that ,COMMA only big companies who used more sophisticated mining technologies started to take gold out of there .PERIOD <BREAK>
sorry ,COMMA i hate to carry on .PERIOD <BREAK>
i thought oh my god ,COMMA maybe i can do the same with these boring newspapers .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA that's where we were at the end of about <NUM> months .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i said ,COMMA if you put it all on this ,COMMA i'm going to deliver it to him ,COMMA if you can figure out who this person is ,COMMA because all i had was his name -- ray -- and this little piece of audio and the fact that his daughter was upset .PERIOD <BREAK>
so you do vocational training ,COMMA home education for those who cannot go to school .PERIOD <BREAK>
but having considered it all ,COMMA i'm still going to vote the way i'm going to vote .PERIOD <BREAK>
you can list what you don't like about them ,COMMA but then you sweep that aside and focus on what you do .PERIOD <BREAK>
i was ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA busy trying to finish off my ph .PERIOD d .PERIOD which was in a completely unrelated area of how people interact ,COMMA contributors interact ,COMMA how articles are formed in wikipedia -- trying to figure out how quality emerges from the system .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's that little green sliver on the horizon ,COMMA which makes them very nervous about rising oceans .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so what we've done with the science is we're showing the international commission ,COMMA building new models ,COMMA showing them that a two-stock no-mixing model -- to this day ,COMMA used to reject the cites treaty -- that model isn't the right model .PERIOD <BREAK>
tourist :COLON i think that people are very frustrated that they're not able to get closer to see what's going on .PERIOD <BREAK>
ja ,COMMA well i could have translated that ,COMMA but you would have been none the wiser .PERIOD <BREAK>
if the man in the photograph that appeared in the newspapers ,COMMA holding the hand of his dead child was standing in front of us now ,COMMA there are no words that we could say to him .PERIOD <BREAK>
so beautiful that i will even give up a laugh to explain my love of this particular planet ,COMMA and the day saturday ,COMMA named after it ,COMMA wonderfully .PERIOD <BREAK>
and we can see places where stars are forming ,COMMA like the eagle nebula .PERIOD we see stars dying .PERIOD <BREAK>
now ,COMMA this was cosmic .PERIOD <BREAK>
here ,COMMA you've got martian alphabet .PERIOD <BREAK>
yes ,COMMA things will get ugly ,COMMA and it will happen soon -- certainly in our lifetime -- but we are more than capable of getting through everything that's coming .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's typical of these hallucinations that they may come in a flash and disappear in a flash .PERIOD <BREAK>
the water is lovely .PERIOD <BREAK>
and that is to focus on a few critical objectives .PERIOD <BREAK>
the catch ,COMMA however ,COMMA to this is that you have to innovate faster and faster and faster .PERIOD <BREAK>
of course ,COMMA none of them liked it .PERIOD <BREAK>
we think we're getting this wide view of the globe .PERIOD <BREAK>
but i can offer some natural light and year-round climate control .PERIOD <BREAK>
not right now .PERIOD wait till i finish talking .PERIOD <BREAK>
now all this fuss about a single one of our traits tells us there's something worth explaining .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the tourist brochures pointed me in the direction of this bridge -- i love bridges ,COMMA metaphorically and symbolically and structurally -- and it was a bit of a disappointment ,COMMA because of the sludge from the river was encrusted on it ;SEMICOLON it really wasn't in use .PERIOD <BREAK>
all of our patents ,COMMA our entire approach to patents and invention ,COMMA is based on the idea that the inventor knows what the invention is for ;SEMICOLON we can say what it's for .PERIOD <BREAK>
but cambodia is not alone .PERIOD <BREAK>
and they brought us in and said ,COMMA what would you do ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
it was when i put the water in that i realized that i'd put a skin on water itself .PERIOD <BREAK>
but it was hard to do that when i was born with spina bifida and my kidneys and bladder weren't working .PERIOD <BREAK>
i guess we could make a glow chicken .PERIOD <BREAK>
and please ,COMMA any designers out there ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and i think it's a very interesting question -- what is there about the way the colony is organized that might give some function to a reserve of ants who are doing nothing ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
with that preamble ,COMMA let's show the first two-minute videotape ,COMMA which shows a little airplane for surveillance and moving to a giant airplane .PERIOD <BREAK>
and now it can go on other surfaces because of the new adhesive that the stanford group was able to do in designing this incredible robot .PERIOD <BREAK>
except that nowadays ,COMMA it's heavily disputed .PERIOD <BREAK>
most halls come straight down into a proscenium .PERIOD <BREAK>
and most people respond really well to this exercise .PERIOD <BREAK>
now in the industry -- i don't know whether you care about this ,COMMA or how much time i have to go into this .PERIOD <BREAK>
that's how it works .PERIOD <BREAK>
we have done already <NUM> exhibitions in the cities .PERIOD <BREAK>
richard saul wurman :COLON i remember hearing him talk at penn .PERIOD <BREAK>
it puts a human face on issues which from afar can appear abstract or ideological or monumental in their global impact .PERIOD <BREAK>
thank you .PERIOD <BREAK>
run away .PERIOD run .PERIOD <BREAK>
and we're showing that we can actually turn this data into working models and simulations of brain regions .PERIOD <BREAK>
they're found everywhere on the planet except for the arctic and the southern tip of south america .PERIOD <BREAK>
so suppose we toss a coin repeatedly .PERIOD <BREAK>
and during the evolution of life on the earth ,COMMA it was the colonization of the land by plants that helped create the benign climate we currently enjoy .PERIOD <BREAK>
and by specifying eight different goals ,COMMA the united nations has said that there are so many things needed to change in a country in order to get the good life for people .PERIOD <BREAK>
ostensibly ,COMMA he's dead now .PERIOD <BREAK>
it would help to have a manual .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it's the cost of driving that's making people want to be able to do this .PERIOD <BREAK>
and all of a sudden as i was going down the stairs i noticed that there was a man slumped to the side ,COMMA shirtless ,COMMA not moving ,COMMA and people were just stepping over him -- hundreds and hundreds of people .PERIOD <BREAK>
i know it works .PERIOD <BREAK>
all right ,COMMA if this view of language and its value in solving the crisis of visual theft is true ,COMMA any species that acquires it should show an explosion of creativity and prosperity .PERIOD <BREAK>
so as edmund burke said ,COMMA the restraints on men ,COMMA as well as their liberties ,COMMA are to be reckoned among their rights .PERIOD <BREAK>
but for me ,COMMA it doesn't .PERIOD that is a wonderful thing .PERIOD <BREAK>
good grief ,COMMA not to this crowd .PERIOD <BREAK>
if it didn’t ,COMMA the whole idea was toast ,COMMA and i might as well move on to other things .PERIOD <BREAK>
we have all heard about the tremendous human loss in the earthquake in haiti ,COMMA but we haven't heard enough about why all those lives were lost .PERIOD <BREAK>
in order to do six cups ,COMMA i must have perfect control over three with my right hand .PERIOD <BREAK>
if you don't kill the fish ,COMMA they take a longer time to die ,COMMA they grow larger and they reproduce a lot .PERIOD <BREAK>
which brings on another threshold effect i like to call furnace dumping ,COMMA which is ,COMMA quite simply ,COMMA if you have a building that doesn't need to be heated with a furnace ,COMMA you save a whole bunch of money up front .PERIOD <BREAK>
here we come down with the eradication of smallpox ,COMMA better education ,COMMA health service .PERIOD <BREAK>
you know ,COMMA a lot of people risk their lives in a brief act of heroism ,COMMA which is kind of cool ,COMMA but jill has what i call slow heroism .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is what our whole economy is thrusting upon us ,COMMA particularly illustrated in that left-hand corner :COLON hockey sticks .PERIOD <BREAK>
i see a lot of children .PERIOD they are walking up and down stairs .PERIOD <BREAK>
here's an octopus moving across the reef ,COMMA finds a spot to settle down ,COMMA curls up and then disappears into the background .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i think total personalization in this new world will require total transparency .PERIOD <BREAK>
not a single one of you thought about clapping in a slightly different way other than sitting in your seats there and using two hands .PERIOD <BREAK>
and that's not good ,COMMA for a young married man to go home in a bad mood .PERIOD <BREAK>
i got a friend of mine ,COMMA an engineer ,COMMA and three other doctors -- abhishek joined the team -- and we wanted to solve this problem .PERIOD <BREAK>
kind of a fun thing to do .PERIOD <BREAK>

why aren't you ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and to change the game ,COMMA you have to change the frame ,COMMA the way we see things -- to change the frame from hostility to hospitality ,COMMA from terrorism to tourism .PERIOD <BREAK>
i got interested in them because they're the most extreme example of a surface where the texture and the -- let's call it the decoration -- i know the frog doesn't think of it as decoration ,COMMA but that's how it works -- are all intricately connected to one another .PERIOD <BREAK>
today ,COMMA i'm using it to create permanent ,COMMA billowing ,COMMA voluptuous forms the scale of hard-edged buildings in cities around the world .PERIOD <BREAK>

so i'm going to show you a number of projects that my colleagues and i at mit are working on to achieve this self-assembling future .PERIOD <BREAK>
more often than not it shows you exactly what you should do .PERIOD <BREAK>
well we know that that was not a cheap war .PERIOD <BREAK>
the point that i would like to ask you to try to do ,COMMA is just in <NUM> seconds -- and i know this is in a sense an impossible task -- write down what you think is probably some of the top priorities .PERIOD <BREAK>
they discovered that adult cells ,COMMA taken from you and me ,COMMA could be reprogrammed back into embryonic-like cells ,COMMA which they termed ips cells ,COMMA or induced pluripotent stem cells .PERIOD <BREAK>
but it's peripheral activities ,COMMA like these ,COMMA that allow people to get together ,COMMA doing fun things .PERIOD <BREAK>
when people are given the opportunity to create in the world ,COMMA there's really two things they want .PERIOD <BREAK>
andrew ,COMMA can you put that chart up ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>

so what can we do about that ?QUESTIONMARK what can we say ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
we've been talking at this conference about african success stories .PERIOD <BREAK>
our team ,COMMA befittingly i think ,COMMA named it after one of those dreamers of the copernican time ,COMMA johannes kepler ,COMMA and that telescope's sole purpose is to go out ,COMMA find the planets that orbit other stars in our galaxy ,COMMA and tell us how often do planets like our own earth happen to be out there .PERIOD <BREAK>
to do this ,COMMA at a certain point ,COMMA you need someone to bump you out of your flock and into another flock .PERIOD <BREAK>
we have very strong intuitions about all kinds of things -- our own ability ,COMMA how the economy works ,COMMA how we should pay school teachers .PERIOD <BREAK>
more than <NUM> percent ,COMMA <NUM> percent ,COMMA of the living space on our planet is ocean .PERIOD <BREAK>

david hughes at ohio state university has written a primer on afrocentric architecture in which he's used some of these fractal structures .PERIOD <BREAK>

where do we rank three weeks ago in another report by the oecd ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
it's like dying from inside-out .PERIOD <BREAK>
and when the vaccine appeared last winter ,COMMA there were a lot of people -- a surprising number -- who refused to get it -- as a nice example of how people's feelings of security change ,COMMA how their model changes ,COMMA sort of wildly with no new information ,COMMA with no new input .PERIOD <BREAK>
only the egg of the parasite will be inserted into the body fluids of the aphid .PERIOD <BREAK>
they're immensely powerful social institutions and many of their features can be traced back to earlier features that we can really make sense of by reverse engineering .PERIOD <BREAK>
right now ,COMMA we don't have that but i'm very sure that we will be able to do that at some stage .PERIOD <BREAK>
i think that the time is ripe to make fundamental changes in our civilization .PERIOD <BREAK>
many people argue that the <NUM> st century is going to repeat the <NUM> th century ,COMMA in which world war one ,COMMA the great conflagration in which the european state system tore itself apart and destroyed its centrality in the world ,COMMA that that was caused by the rise in the power of germany and the fear it created in britain .PERIOD <BREAK>

there are a million pictures that i could click through here ,COMMA and had to choose carefully -- this is one of my favorites -- of students learning ,COMMA of what learning can look like in a landscape where we let go of the idea that kids have to come to school to get the information ,COMMA but instead ,COMMA ask them what they can do with it .PERIOD <BREAK>
steven pinker :COLON very much .PERIOD it would fit both in wright's theory ,COMMA that it allows us to enjoy the benefits of cooperation over larger and larger circles .PERIOD but also ,COMMA i think it helps us imagine what it's like to be someone else .PERIOD i think when you read these horrific tortures that were common in the middle ages ,COMMA you think ,COMMA how could they possibly have done it ,COMMA how could they have not have empathized with the person that they're disemboweling ?QUESTIONMARK but clearly ,COMMA as far as they're concerned ,COMMA this is just an alien being that does not have feelings akin to their own .PERIOD anything ,COMMA i think ,COMMA that makes it easier to imagine trading places with someone else means that it increases your moral consideration to that other person .PERIOD <BREAK>
and my immunologist told me that i should also wipe down all of the remote controls and iphones in my house ,COMMA because those are just orgies of germs .PERIOD <BREAK>
so we just walked around ,COMMA and we met a woman ,COMMA and i showed her my book .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it's all brute force .PERIOD and that's the way we've been approaching energy .PERIOD so the lesson in agriculture is that you can actually change the system that's based on brute force as you start merging that system and learning that system and actually applying biology .PERIOD and you move from a discipline of engineering ,COMMA you move from a discipline of chemistry ,COMMA into a discipline of biology .PERIOD and probably one of the most important human beings on the planet is this guy behind me .PERIOD <BREAK>
i know ;SEMICOLON i spent a lot of my career in artificial intelligence ,COMMA trying to build machines that could do some of this thinking for us ,COMMA that could give us answers .PERIOD <BREAK>
we don't have a language for it yet .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's going to be a pretty crowded place ,COMMA at least eight billion people .PERIOD <BREAK>
so we're going to imagine we're recording from a single neuron in the hippocampus of this rat here .PERIOD <BREAK>

talent ,COMMA background ,COMMA education ,COMMA freedom ,COMMA networks ,COMMA opportunities ,COMMA wealth ,COMMA ideas ,COMMA creativity .PERIOD <BREAK>
the brain will do more of whatever got that reward .PERIOD <BREAK>

maybe some things are bad traditions and they need to be changed .PERIOD <BREAK>
that's routinely translated as ,COMMA i think ,COMMA therefore i am .PERIOD <BREAK>
what we've been able to do is to give these virulent infections ,COMMA but we give them in conjunction with our anti-quorum sensing molecules -- so these are molecules that look kind of like the real thing ,COMMA but they're a little bit different which i've depicted on this slide .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it is my contention that the manner in which we train our leaders will make all the difference .PERIOD <BREAK>
first ,COMMA within each video ,COMMA the brat pack characters are used as a kind of template for performing the social reality of each group .PERIOD <BREAK>
but if they were together planting trees for the environment ,COMMA it was okay -- creativity .PERIOD <BREAK>

it's games that fit into a healthy lifestyle .PERIOD <BREAK>
i'm going to finish up with a song of mine called weather systems .PERIOD <BREAK>
there we can see fibonacci numbers related to the golden section ,COMMA because fibonacci and golden section relate to the unfolding of the measured meter of matter ,COMMA as i refer to it .PERIOD <BREAK>
if compassion is so good for us ,COMMA why don't we train our health care providers in compassion so that they can do what they're supposed to do ,COMMA which is to really transform suffering ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>

pushing ahead with nuclear power will mean we really know where all of the fissile material is ,COMMA and we can move toward zero weapons left ,COMMA once we know all that .PERIOD <BREAK>

and there's a slight sense that isaiah knows this ,COMMA because he says ,COMMA this is god speaking ,COMMA of course ,COMMA i have called thee by thy name though thou hast not known me .PERIOD <BREAK>
here ,COMMA we have all the binary arithmetic and logic that drove the computer revolution .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA that was taken from orbit ;SEMICOLON we had the camera zoom on the surface ,COMMA and we actually saw the rover on the surface .PERIOD <BREAK>

and you know ,COMMA i came back to school ,COMMA i finished my degrees and told my parents i wanted to be a banjo player .PERIOD <BREAK>
so as an example of why this has been -- or how this can be important :COLON we recently had a situation where a neo-nazi website discovered wikipedia ,COMMA and they said ,COMMA oh ,COMMA well ,COMMA this is horrible ,COMMA this jewish conspiracy of a website and we're going to get certain articles deleted that we don't like .PERIOD <BREAK>
it is probably one of the most dramatic shifts in globalization and one of the most powerful economic tools that we're seeing in our world today .PERIOD <BREAK>

developing the skycar has been a real challenge .PERIOD <BREAK>
in writing a story ,COMMA it is the place where i begin .PERIOD <BREAK>
the u .PERIOD k .PERIOD australia ,COMMA new zealand ,COMMA western europe ,COMMA eastern europe ,COMMA latin america ,COMMA the middle east ,COMMA east asia and south asia .PERIOD <BREAK>

the nitrogen has two problems .PERIOD <BREAK>
so as you can guess ,COMMA my mother tongue is french .PERIOD <BREAK>
now ,COMMA if you look at the high sea ,COMMA there might be beautiful ,COMMA calm ocean ,COMMA like a mirror .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so ,COMMA i thought perhaps incarcerated men and women -- who don't have access to nature ,COMMA who often have a lot of time ,COMMA they often have space ,COMMA and you don't need any sharp tools to work with mosses -- would be great partners .PERIOD <BREAK>
in terms of dollars per what's stored ,COMMA it's simply the best .PERIOD <BREAK>
and you can see that the green neuron touches the red neuron at two locations ,COMMA and these are what are called synapses .PERIOD <BREAK>
her mother died while giving birth to her ,COMMA and no one had any idea who her father was .PERIOD <BREAK>

he triggered the modernist revolution .PERIOD <BREAK>
and consider treating psychotic disorders -- and i want this involved with the ted group -- such as obsessive-compulsive disorder that ,COMMA presently ,COMMA is not well treated with drugs ,COMMA and includes five million americans .PERIOD <BREAK>
and therefore ,COMMA the standard process ,COMMA where you develop a molecule ,COMMA put it into mice ,COMMA into men ,COMMA are not yielding those results -- the billions of dollars that have been spent .PERIOD <BREAK>
we see in our material flows that car steels don't become car steel again because of the contaminants of the coatings -- bismuth ,COMMA antimony ,COMMA copper and so on .PERIOD <BREAK>
and as a result of the association ,COMMA i'm now a director of the mellon financial corporation that bought dreyfus .PERIOD <BREAK>
and they started listening to the marketplace ,COMMA and they came back with ideas for cassava chips ,COMMA and banana chips ,COMMA and sorghum bread ,COMMA and before you knew it ,COMMA we had cornered the kigali market ,COMMA and the women were earning three to four times the national average .PERIOD <BREAK>

i had a butterfly period ,COMMA a snake period ,COMMA a bird period ,COMMA a fish period ,COMMA a cave period and finally and definitively ,COMMA an ant period .PERIOD <BREAK>
you should be raising income and let people decide what they want to do with their money .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's like the old maxim of you can tell somebody something and show them ,COMMA but if they do it they really learn it .PERIOD <BREAK>

and that's what we use to inject ,COMMA as we start to do our deep dives .PERIOD <BREAK>
they use the upper half of the face ;SEMICOLON the ears are very expressive .PERIOD <BREAK>

so here's the format :COLON they're going to have six minutes each ,COMMA and then after one little ,COMMA quick exchange between them ,COMMA i want two people on each side of this debate in the audience to have <NUM> seconds to make one short ,COMMA crisp ,COMMA pungent ,COMMA powerful point .PERIOD <BREAK>
yes ,COMMA to be sure ,COMMA science has done much to push back certain types of human suffering .PERIOD <BREAK>
passive tolerance to evil through inaction or indifference .PERIOD <BREAK>
and look what it does with its foot to get over challenging terrain .PERIOD <BREAK>
so what really matters are the more right-brained creative ,COMMA conceptual kinds of abilities .PERIOD <BREAK>
and that poor country runs off that ledge ,COMMA does that cartoon thing and then drops .PERIOD <BREAK>
i can't even set it on fire -- they took my cigarette lighter !EXCLAMATIONMARK <BREAK>
wow ,COMMA wow ,COMMA ok ,COMMA stop .PERIOD <BREAK>

when i came home off that elephant ,COMMA do you know what the most amazing part was ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
the teachers are going to tell us how we're most useful .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's a kiva ,COMMA and larry's putting some water in there ,COMMA and it works much better than a fish .PERIOD <BREAK>
in fact ,COMMA if you flash them with a camera they catch on fire .PERIOD <BREAK>
i'm not using any hypothetical data .PERIOD <BREAK>
needless to say ,COMMA i was drastically wrong .PERIOD <BREAK>
i was visiting with an artist ,COMMA michael heizer ,COMMA out in the desert near las vegas somewhere .PERIOD <BREAK>
so these kids worked harder than they've ever worked on anything in their lives ,COMMA because there was that outside audience ,COMMA there was isabel allende on the other end .PERIOD <BREAK>
similarly ,COMMA a study in e-content showed that much of global news from u .PERIOD s .PERIOD news creators is recycled stories from the ap wire services and reuters ,COMMA and don't put things into a context that people can understand their connection to it .PERIOD <BREAK>
this shaped wok doesn't work very well ;SEMICOLON this caught fire three times .PERIOD <BREAK>
there wasn't any real risk ,COMMA but people were scared .PERIOD <BREAK>
your homework is -- you know ,COMMA how does an aircraft's wing create lift ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
audience :COLON wow .PERIOD <BREAK>
you put a smart meter in your home ,COMMA and you see how much electricity you're using right now ,COMMA how much it's costing you ,COMMA your kids go around and turn the lights off pretty quickly .PERIOD <BREAK>
but he was setting fiscal policy in that game for high school players who were playing with him .PERIOD <BREAK>
can there really be only one interface ?QUESTIONMARK there can't .PERIOD <BREAK>
and that feeling hasn't left me yet .PERIOD <BREAK>
and this is an insight that came ,COMMA about two decades ago ,COMMA from a person that i'm very fortunate to work with ,COMMA david kaplan .PERIOD <BREAK>
we knew conservation would fail if it doesn't work to improve the lives of the local communities .PERIOD <BREAK>
what we have found working with the world bank is that the poor man's safety net ,COMMA the best investment ,COMMA is school feeding .PERIOD <BREAK>
boy :COLON on the day of judgment ,COMMA god will ask me ,COMMA why did you do that ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
well ,COMMA then i got to thinking :COLON this scientific paradigm of mine suggests something different -- and ,COMMA by the way ,COMMA i've now got huge computation capabilities in mathematica ,COMMA and i'm a ceo with some worldly resources to do large ,COMMA seemingly crazy ,COMMA projects -- so i decided to just try to see how much of the systematic knowledge that's out there in the world we could make computable .PERIOD <BREAK>
i'm working on this with the field and space robotics laboratory and my friend steve dubowsky at mit ,COMMA and we have come up with the idea of having little ,COMMA jumping bean-like robots that are propelled by artificial muscle ,COMMA which is one of the dubowsky lab's specialties -- are the epams ,COMMA or artificial muscles .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i love that girl's reaction so much .PERIOD <BREAK>
but first ,COMMA i would like to take you back to this event :COLON the collapse of communism .PERIOD <BREAK>
forty miles an hour into a fixed barrier -- <NUM> gs .PERIOD <BREAK>
if you happen to live in a part of the world where none of this applies ,COMMA then you don't need an alternative education .PERIOD <BREAK>
and this really became the template for moving forward .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i said ,COMMA no way ,COMMA i'm not doing it .PERIOD <BREAK>
you only want clean environments in which to function .PERIOD <BREAK>
prefabricated from the most traditional of materials ,COMMA but that material -- because of the technology ,COMMA the computing ability ,COMMA the ability to prefabricate ,COMMA make high-performance components out of timber -- very much at the cutting edge .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the shutter speed of the camera actually makes it slightly less effective in this case .PERIOD <BREAK>
so you'll see images of this remarkable building .PERIOD <BREAK>
an example would be in finding nemo ,COMMA in the short tension ,COMMA you were always worried ,COMMA would dory's short-term memory make her forget whatever she was being told by marlin .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it raises a question :COLON what changed ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
really more like <NUM> years to do it right .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's like a wall to the electricity .PERIOD <BREAK>
and no matter where i am ,COMMA what's really going on here is that it's an eye-tracking system that tries to locate my eyes .PERIOD <BREAK>
in this hospital ,COMMA there is one person qualified to deliver anesthesia ,COMMA and she's qualified because she has <NUM> ,COMMA maybe <NUM> months of training in anesthesia .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's the drone .PERIOD what is the drone ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
so ,COMMA here's my friend paul .PERIOD <BREAK>
however ,COMMA the change that came through foreign intervention created even worse circumstances for the people and deepened the sense of paralysis and inferiority in that part of the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
and of course ,COMMA since i really don't know how to write code ,COMMA i had help in this .PERIOD <BREAK>
so here's another example .PERIOD this one's somewhat more somber .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is my mother and aunt teaching donna how to ride a bike .PERIOD <BREAK>
i want to say a word for the soil and the bees and the plants and the animals ,COMMA and tell you about a tool ,COMMA a very simple tool that i have found .PERIOD <BREAK>
and here's another aspect of the sorts of things that chris and i were doing .PERIOD <BREAK>

this is a scottish castle where people are playing golf indoors ,COMMA and the trick was to bang the golf ball off of suits of armor -- which you can't see there .PERIOD <BREAK>
because the road map to get rid of this disease involves many things .PERIOD <BREAK>
but i'd want one that could play ,COMMA too .PERIOD <BREAK>
so it's really interesting ,COMMA and it makes sense in a way ,COMMA that they're still young ,COMMA so why would they be getting diseases of aging until their old ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
if you have an idea ,COMMA send it back to us .PERIOD <BREAK>
we squashed it ,COMMA we rethought it ,COMMA but mainly we renamed it the heart of school ,COMMA and that changed everything forever .PERIOD <BREAK>
our employee turnover dropped to one-third of the industry average ,COMMA and during that five year dotcom bust ,COMMA we tripled in size .PERIOD <BREAK>

china exports business people ,COMMA nannies ,COMMA students ,COMMA teachers to teach chinese around the region ,COMMA to intermarry and to occupy ever greater commanding heights of the economies .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is one of the more ambitious ones .PERIOD <BREAK>
and you can see there ,COMMA it needs a quarter-circle of paper to make a flap .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i've done this because i really believe that mobile computing is the future of personal computing ,COMMA and i'm trying to make the world a little bit better by working on these things .PERIOD <BREAK>
and our values are beginning to unite us .PERIOD <BREAK>
the cab stopped ,COMMA and i pulled my body from it feeling each ounce of weight as i walked to the elevator .PERIOD <BREAK>
in the year <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> percent of the world's coltan was sourced to the killing fields of the eastern democratic republic of congo .PERIOD <BREAK>
and well ,COMMA i didn't expect them to even answer my email .PERIOD <BREAK>
so it was kind of weird to see those images and those eyes stare back at me through a television .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so i expected to walk into this building and be met with this cacophony of honking and braying and squawking ,COMMA but instead ,COMMA when we stepped through those doors and into the building ,COMMA it was eerily silent .PERIOD <BREAK>
we believe in risk awareness .PERIOD <BREAK>
and often ,COMMA the movie's ,COMMA like ,COMMA there and it's going ,COMMA and then something happens and you go ,COMMA oh-- and then something else ,COMMA and you're ,COMMA mmm .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is an independent republic ,COMMA probably a failed state .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is an early-on photograph -- you can see ,COMMA we had these gushers .PERIOD <BREAK>
as the work on paradigms ,COMMA long time ago showed -- thomas kuhn's work -- it's in the intersection of ideas that new developments -- true breakthroughs -- occur .PERIOD <BREAK>
well ,COMMA that's another .PERIOD i did spend some time shepherding .PERIOD <BREAK>
well ,COMMA it turns out that this seems to be the result of at least two biases that we have at the psychological level .PERIOD <BREAK>
we're transferring just a few little data bits when we're doing road controlling ,COMMA road pricing .PERIOD <BREAK>
thank you very much .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i thought ,COMMA this is going to be a piece of cake ,COMMA because i always have preliminary talks with these people for just maybe <NUM> or <NUM> minutes .PERIOD <BREAK>
since september the <NUM> th ,COMMA when my work on islam suddenly propelled me into public life ,COMMA in a way that i'd never imagined ,COMMA i've been able to sort of go all over the world ,COMMA and finding ,COMMA everywhere i go ,COMMA a yearning for change .PERIOD <BREAK>
it did help by promoting observation and experiment .PERIOD <BREAK>
since every scientist in the world now believes this ,COMMA and even president bush has seen the light ,COMMA or pretends to ,COMMA we can take this is a given .PERIOD <BREAK>
i would just like to say that one of the big things ,COMMA when we look at waste and when we look at ways that we can really be generous and contribute to each other ,COMMA but also move to create a better economic situation and a better environmental situation ,COMMA is by sharing failures .PERIOD <BREAK>
imagine if a group of sculptors could be inside of a lattice of atoms and sculpt with their material .PERIOD <BREAK>

and a friend of mine in austria felt so sorry for me that he talked the largest casino owner in linz into letting us wrap his building .PERIOD <BREAK>
you come into this major airport ,COMMA and they simply have a b .PERIOD <BREAK>
because your body will do most of the work of fixing it if we just sort of prop it up in the ways that are wrong .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is not a dead body .PERIOD this is a body who basically ,COMMA in this particular case ,COMMA feels the force and tries to protect its head .PERIOD <BREAK>
a metamaterial is an artificial material ,COMMA which manipulates ,COMMA in this case ,COMMA electromagnetic radiation ,COMMA in a way that you couldn't otherwise .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i have an information charity which has done huge scale amount of work in india .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is actually two of my favorites :COLON the pin-board thom yorke and a lego thom yorke .PERIOD <BREAK>

being human is an art form .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is an area in the prefrontal cortex ,COMMA a region where we can use cognition to try to overcome aversive emotional states .PERIOD <BREAK>
some countries accept that their databases can go out on the world ,COMMA but what we really need is ,COMMA of course ,COMMA a search function .PERIOD <BREAK>
the answer was the most low-tech thing you can imagine .PERIOD <BREAK>
or when you understood something you had never done before .PERIOD <BREAK>
we're terrible at models that span <NUM> years .PERIOD <BREAK>
turns out the gentleman in this picture is a guy named joe beery ,COMMA who was lucky enough to be the cio of a company called life technologies .PERIOD <BREAK>
instead of talking about little green men ,COMMA he talked about how the psyche of the europeans had been traumatized by the war ,COMMA and now they're projecting flying saucers into the sky .PERIOD <BREAK>
so if we add in a chimpanzee here ,COMMA we will see more differences .PERIOD <BREAK>
it explains why hoover found it very difficult to persuade the world that it was more than vacuum cleaners ,COMMA and why companies like unilever and p&amp ;SEMICOLON g keep brands separate ,COMMA like ariel and pringles and dove rather than having one giant parent brand .PERIOD <BREAK>
so the choice of answers were :COLON very good ,COMMA good ,COMMA bad and very bad .PERIOD <BREAK>
but biomimicry means respecting the wisdom of all species .PERIOD <BREAK>
instead ,COMMA the architecture of copyright law and the architecture of digital technologies ,COMMA as they interact ,COMMA have produced the presumption that these activities are illegal .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so the first thought that came to mind is ,COMMA everywhere we park we have electric power .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so indeed ,COMMA there are times when we can find ingredients that [are] bad .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's a working prototype .PERIOD i will use it for all the jumps .PERIOD <BREAK>
way downstream we have the international criminal court .PERIOD <BREAK>
you might say ,COMMA well ,COMMA maybe things just smoothed themselves out .PERIOD <BREAK>
all works of art are talking to us about things .PERIOD <BREAK>
that gets you about four million dead in central africa over the <NUM> s .PERIOD <BREAK>
but if there's a little tiny civilization of green people walking around down there ,COMMA and you make them small enough ,COMMA and we won't see them either .PERIOD that is true .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it's no longer just a i don't know .PERIOD i couldn't get there .PERIOD i guess i'll move on ,COMMA but suddenly a collective consciousness about what is blocked and censored where online .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's about a boy who falls in love with a horse .PERIOD <BREAK>
i want to talk a little bit about the democratic republic of congo .PERIOD <BREAK>
these things resonate with us ,COMMA and ,COMMA if you think about blogs ,COMMA you think of high art blogs ,COMMA the history paintings about ,COMMA you know ,COMMA all biblical stories ,COMMA and then you have this .PERIOD <BREAK>
in fact ,COMMA south africa has not gone down that road .PERIOD <BREAK>
what i found out is that the tooling ,COMMA if you intervened in the software ,COMMA actually produced decorative effects .PERIOD <BREAK>
we have done five thousand interviews .PERIOD <BREAK>
the private actors ,COMMA companies and ngos ,COMMA are going to have to get together to face the major challenges we are going to face .PERIOD <BREAK>
normally it's sort of cordoned off when it's in a museum .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the problem with escaping your day-to-day life is that you have to come home eventually .PERIOD <BREAK>
but where is this going ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
call it network governance .PERIOD call it what you will .PERIOD <BREAK>
so anyway ,COMMA even if i do not understand science entirely ,COMMA for my design i essentially refer to it .PERIOD <BREAK>
your kids will be having milk at school ,COMMA breakfast and lunch .PERIOD right ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
this is simply not what our grandest and best institutes of higher learning are in the business of .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is a beautiful ,COMMA new device that gives you detailed sleep tracking data ,COMMA not just whether you're asleep or awake ,COMMA but also your phase of sleep -- deep sleep ,COMMA light sleep ,COMMA rem sleep .PERIOD <BREAK>
you just drive to the nearest lake ,COMMA stick your hose in it ,COMMA and you've got your car filled up .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's totally free -- there's not even ads .PERIOD <BREAK>
as i say ,COMMA we go in and shake up other industries ,COMMA and i think ,COMMA you know ,COMMA we do it differently and i think that industries are not quite the same as a result of virgin attacking the market .PERIOD <BREAK>
many years ago ,COMMA when i was born in the ' <NUM> s -- ' <NUM> s and ' <NUM> s didn't belong to girls in india .PERIOD <BREAK>
i tell them ,COMMA you are going to make it ,COMMA and you will raise a healthy baby .PERIOD <BREAK>
bottomless wonders spring from simple rules ,COMMA which are repeated without end .PERIOD <BREAK>
but he keeps fighting .PERIOD <BREAK>
so for example i can rear an animal in an environment in which there is meaningless dumb sound ,COMMA a repertoire of sound that i make up ,COMMA that i make ,COMMA just by exposure ,COMMA artificially important to the animal and its young brain .PERIOD <BREAK>
so there are examples like this in medicine -- doctors at harvard who are trying to transform medical education ,COMMA so that you don't get a kind of ethical erosion and loss of empathy ,COMMA which characterizes most medical students in the course of their medical training .PERIOD <BREAK>
so the truth in general is that the kinds of controversies that you would probably think we have within the wikipedia community are not really controversies at all .PERIOD <BREAK>
what that does is ,COMMA you start building up the red blood cell count in your body ,COMMA which helps you carry oxygen better .PERIOD <BREAK>
that is where conventional ideas stop .PERIOD <BREAK>
and charlton heston is made of a floating fiber ,COMMA which i took out of the air .PERIOD <BREAK>
because police are actually more restrained in the use of force than the military are .PERIOD <BREAK>
now when the treasure sank in <NUM> ,COMMA it was the height of the best breeding season scientists had ever recorded for the african penguin -- which at the time ,COMMA was listed as a threatened species .PERIOD <BREAK>

thank you .PERIOD <BREAK>
we're now in the era of super-enabling the surgeon who can now go inside the body and do things with robotic surgery ,COMMA which is here today ,COMMA at a level that was not really possible even five years ago .PERIOD <BREAK>
because my students ,COMMA what they said when they looked upon the world ,COMMA and i asked them ,COMMA what do you really think about the world ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
i was able to morph the culture into a non-sporulating form .PERIOD <BREAK>
of more concern ,COMMA i think ,COMMA is the asteroids that exist between mars and jupiter .PERIOD <BREAK>
do i have a place ,COMMA a venue ,COMMA in mind when i write ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
but if we keep running this for a while ,COMMA we find out that although the pattern we get is very intricate ,COMMA it has a very regular structure .PERIOD <BREAK>
but now here's where the bias comes in .PERIOD <BREAK>
on that self ,COMMA it should be centered -- a bigness ,COMMA a wholeness .PERIOD <BREAK>
back in <NUM> when the movie came out ,COMMA we actually had a grant from the national science foundation to attempt to extract dna from a dinosaur ,COMMA and we chose the dinosaur on the left ,COMMA a tyrannosaurus rex ,COMMA which was a very nice specimen .PERIOD <BREAK>
science has the power to predict the future in many cases now .PERIOD <BREAK>
the map of port au-prince at the end of <NUM> was not all it could be ,COMMA not as good as the map of california .PERIOD <BREAK>
but after a while ,COMMA i just decided here to go all the way and put the paint back into the cans .PERIOD <BREAK>

one is a lack of initiative ;SEMICOLON your students don't self-start .PERIOD <BREAK>
i don't have to be paying attention to what i hear .PERIOD <BREAK>
maybe you have this child at home .PERIOD <BREAK>
but it’s hard to break our habits ,COMMA our adult habits .PERIOD <BREAK>
in terms of dress ,COMMA denim is perhaps the perfect example of something which replaces material value with symbolic value .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's not just making about -- it's making self-assembled cell phones and circuits .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's exactly the same construction ,COMMA but no muffins ,COMMA no mice ,COMMA nothing moving at all .PERIOD <BREAK>
and therefore ,COMMA there was a indeed a prisoner's dilemma ,COMMA which made it very difficult for an individual company ,COMMA an individual exporting country to say ,COMMA we are not going to continue this deadly ,COMMA disastrous habit of large companies to bribe .PERIOD <BREAK>
a couple years ago ,COMMA i was in south africa on safari .PERIOD <BREAK>
they turned a chair from something the purchasing department bought ,COMMA to something that was a status symbol about where you sat at work .PERIOD <BREAK>
but we have an opportunity .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i often look at things as though they're food .PERIOD <BREAK>
i'll play this until your eyeballs completely dissolve .PERIOD <BREAK>
and then ,COMMA instead of taking days to disseminate this information to the people who need it most ,COMMA it can happen automatically .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is how it actually works .PERIOD <BREAK>
and mostly what good dads should be doing this time of year is nestling with their kids and decorating the christmas tree .PERIOD <BREAK>
we needed to be working on soy -- things that we were not focused on .PERIOD <BREAK>
what if all the replacements our bodies need already exist in nature ,COMMA or within our own stem cells ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and ,COMMA of course ,COMMA at kleiner we ,COMMA kind of ,COMMA apologize and say the second best way is to finance it .PERIOD <BREAK>
these are also called mesh networks .PERIOD <BREAK>
so full circle -- why do i do this ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
well ,COMMA my undergraduates and the people i work with haven't discovered this ,COMMA so we actually have people do something altruistic and do something fun ,COMMA and to contrast it .PERIOD <BREAK>
so of course ,COMMA this is a very crude machine ,COMMA but we're working on a micro-scale version of these ,COMMA and hopefully the cubes will be like a powder that you pour in .PERIOD <BREAK>
lo and behold ,COMMA there in reseda ,COMMA ca was rondoron who wanted swap his or her like new copy of sex and the city for my copy of <NUM> .PERIOD <BREAK>
this takes a second ,COMMA but it's a distinctive stage .PERIOD <BREAK>
and then this is our answer to starbucks in thailand -- coffee and condoms .PERIOD <BREAK>
i was talking about social justice ,COMMA and here i was ,COMMA a professional who was pursuing the most unjust act -- of taking knowledge from the people ,COMMA making them anonymous ,COMMA getting rent from that knowledge by sharing it and doing consultancy ,COMMA writing papers and publishing them in the papers ,COMMA getting invited to the conferences ,COMMA getting consultancies and whatever have you .PERIOD <BREAK>
now ,COMMA a weekend in paris ,COMMA a weekend in rome ,COMMA these are different things ;SEMICOLON they have different food ,COMMA different culture ,COMMA different art .PERIOD <BREAK>
it doesn't have a name yet .PERIOD <BREAK>
and then she says ,COMMA not one of our girls .PERIOD <BREAK>
i was very eager to be useful in the world -- i think we all have that feeling .PERIOD <BREAK>
and since they're used so often ,COMMA a lot of times the precise sequence of random characters that is shown to the user is not so fortunate .PERIOD <BREAK>
and this is test on some lip balms that we have over here .PERIOD <BREAK>
look at what you americans are doing in puerto rico .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so that's what we'll do today .PERIOD <BREAK>
but most things ,COMMA you really have to know what's going on in the kitchen ,COMMA because ,COMMA mostly ,COMMA sick people used to be healthy people -- they have the same genome .PERIOD <BREAK>
why kermit ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and the software ,COMMA in a second ,COMMA will give you the casa da musica beethoven logo .PERIOD <BREAK>
there are guys competing with each other .PERIOD <BREAK>
well ,COMMA here is the image .PERIOD <BREAK>
the culture in which we live now is awash with music of improvisation that's been sliced ,COMMA diced ,COMMA layered and ,COMMA god knows ,COMMA distributed and sold .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA they say jesus did talk a lot about helping the outcasts ,COMMA helping poor people .PERIOD <BREAK>
we have made a commitment that we will never let people come out of slavery on our watch ,COMMA and end up as second class citizens .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is the original mac operating system .PERIOD <BREAK>
here were have on the left ,COMMA the internet and on the right ,COMMA the root apparatus .PERIOD <BREAK>
and there is both a way to avoid the dangers of glamour and a way to broaden your appreciation of it .PERIOD <BREAK>
the other one says ,COMMA fine .PERIOD looks good to me .PERIOD <BREAK>
the strange one looks likes this :COLON that we live in a three-dimensional world .PERIOD <BREAK>
we sit here -- you know ,COMMA think about the ground vehicles ,COMMA the human scale -- what do you see in person ?QUESTIONMARK we need to capture that up close to establish that what it's like-type experience .PERIOD <BREAK>
that's basically it .PERIOD <BREAK>
which leads us to conclude american businesses fail faster than americans ,COMMA and therefore american businesses are evolving faster than americans .PERIOD <BREAK>

that way we do away with a few internet myths .PERIOD <BREAK>
it was performed last september one time only in the atlantic avenue tunnel in brooklyn ,COMMA which is considered to be the oldest underground train tunnel in the world ,COMMA built in <NUM> .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it's not just going to happen because a spirit of love wafts us down .PERIOD <BREAK>
so what i wanted to argue is ,COMMA books are within our grasp .PERIOD <BREAK>
you get a divergence of newtonian and quantum thinking at that point ,COMMA you have a split in your dialog that is so deep ,COMMA and so far ,COMMA that they cannot bring this together at all .PERIOD <BREAK>
the bad news ,COMMA however ,COMMA to this question of will evil prevail ,COMMA is that evil lives on .PERIOD <BREAK>
if i can repeat anything ,COMMA i have the possibility of a pattern from hickory nuts and chicken eggs ,COMMA shards of glass ,COMMA branches .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's a robot that has three legs ,COMMA which is inspired by nature .PERIOD <BREAK>
on a sunday night .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is the connectome of the worm c .PERIOD elegans .PERIOD <BREAK>
i write about food .PERIOD i write about cooking .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i just start out with a trace because i was thinking ,COMMA what really makes us ?QUESTIONMARK -- you know ,COMMA it's actually [the] past ,COMMA what makes a person .PERIOD <BREAK>
usually they eat something a bit larger .PERIOD <BREAK>
a generous mistress whom many loved much .PERIOD <BREAK>
the challenge ,COMMA though ,COMMA for a wholegrain baker is ,COMMA you know ,COMMA how do you make it taste good ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and the risks stay high throughout the decade .PERIOD <BREAK>
when somebody comes to me and ask for what i am known ,COMMA i mean ,COMMA yes ,COMMA lemon squeezer ,COMMA toilet brush ,COMMA toothpick ,COMMA beautiful toilet seats ,COMMA and why not -- a toothbrush ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
no ,COMMA no ,COMMA no ,COMMA the next one is actually blue ,COMMA to your left ,COMMA and says heathrow express .PERIOD <BREAK>
right ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
we're going to look at the mid-ocean ridge ,COMMA a <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> -mile long mountain range .PERIOD <BREAK>
there are flash points in india and pakistan ,COMMA in the middle east ,COMMA in north korea ,COMMA other places where the use of nuclear weapons ,COMMA while initially locally ,COMMA could very rapidly go into a situation where we'd be facing all-out nuclear war .PERIOD <BREAK>
and everybody was telling me it was a different world .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's very nice for discussion ,COMMA discourse ,COMMA making films and everything .PERIOD <BREAK>
i think we all always have the choice in the end not to do the bad thing .PERIOD <BREAK>
he doesn't have dysmorphophobia ,COMMA but i'm using his photograph to illustrate the fact that he looks exactly like a dysmorphophobic .PERIOD <BREAK>
now it may also be the last cookbook that ever does it .PERIOD <BREAK>
so you see us here cutting up some watermelon .PERIOD the idea with this is that we're going to eliminate tons of food miles ,COMMA wasted energy ,COMMA and overfishing of tuna by creating tuna ,COMMA or any exotic produce or item from a very far-away place ,COMMA with local ,COMMA organic produce ;SEMICOLON so we have a watermelon from wisconsin .PERIOD <BREAK>
i found this passion not far from here ,COMMA actually ,COMMA when i was nine years old .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is another painting .PERIOD <BREAK>
anyone on our panel ,COMMA verify the answer .PERIOD <BREAK>
i mean ,COMMA there we are .PERIOD <BREAK>
the effect is just electric .PERIOD <BREAK>
sure enough ,COMMA their tools were more complicated than those of homo erectus ,COMMA but they too showed very little change over the <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> years or so that those species ,COMMA the neanderthals ,COMMA lived in eurasia .PERIOD <BREAK>
rhetoric ,COMMA the art of organizing the world of words to maximum effect .PERIOD <BREAK>
but you don't talk about it so much .PERIOD <BREAK>
mars is half the size of the earth ,COMMA but because two-thirds of the earth is covered by water ,COMMA the land area on mars is comparable to the land area on earth .PERIOD <BREAK>
and you tend to find topics that are almost entirely african-american conversations .PERIOD <BREAK>
and you learn great things about these places .PERIOD <BREAK>
when i took this picture ,COMMA the window was frozen because of the moisture of the night .PERIOD <BREAK>
my own interest in this subject ,COMMA and my passion for it ,COMMA began rather accidentally .PERIOD <BREAK>
but recently ,COMMA any annual report of a power company doesn't have a power station on it .PERIOD <BREAK>
and on part of that field campaign we even brought an aircraft with us .PERIOD <BREAK>
well ,COMMA i think what part of the problem is that ,COMMA in haiti ,COMMA although the problem is huge ,COMMA somehow we understand it ,COMMA it's localized .PERIOD <BREAK>
and second of all ,COMMA his data was grainy and fuzzy ,COMMA and he couldn't quite make out what it was he was looking at .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the plastic heads ,COMMA sometimes you want to project them .PERIOD <BREAK>
is this the face of leonardo da vinci or isn't it ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
finally ,COMMA morning of day <NUM> ,COMMA we got the all-clear ,COMMA loaded up the helicopters -- two helicopters flying in tandem -- dropped me off at the edge of the pack ice .PERIOD <BREAK>
i think part of the education variable we talked about before is the networking experience you get when you go to college where you do get a mix of people that you might not interact with otherwise .PERIOD <BREAK>
as one businessman in new york said to me ,COMMA he said ,COMMA anything she liked ,COMMA i liked .PERIOD <BREAK>
it’s not just what you see in picture .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is why all the people who believe in this type of spirit are welcome to be on that team .PERIOD <BREAK>
remember that children's book where you shake and the sexuality of the parents change ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and she says ,COMMA oh ,COMMA go ahead .PERIOD tase me .PERIOD and so he does .PERIOD <BREAK>
so we thought that this is what was happening :COLON that children in groups can self-instruct themselves to use a computer and the internet .PERIOD but under what circumstances ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
well ,COMMA we would like to encourage all of you to do your part to help protect einstein's animal friends ,COMMA and to do your part to help protect their homes that they live [in] .PERIOD <BREAK>
while some of these instincts may be innate ,COMMA most are learned ,COMMA and all of them are hardwired into our brains .PERIOD <BREAK>
<NUM> people who were basically outside of being really sick ,COMMA paying for the one retiree who was experiencing debilitating disease .PERIOD <BREAK>
taken from their families ,COMMA sequestered in a shadowy world of darkness for <NUM> years -- two nine-year periods deliberately chosen to evoke the nine months they spend in the natural mother's womb .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so ,COMMA we're talking about parallel planes of existence ,COMMA sort of like a book jacket and the book that it covers .PERIOD <BREAK>
i start with my idea .PERIOD i abstract it .PERIOD <BREAK>
interviewer :COLON it's actually quite difficult to walk .PERIOD <BREAK>
in other words ,COMMA categorize equipment problem from a people problem .PERIOD <BREAK>
now this is the dallas theater .PERIOD it was an unusual client for us ,COMMA because they came to us and they said ,COMMA we need you to do a new building .PERIOD we've been working in a temporary space for <NUM> years ,COMMA but because of that temporary space ,COMMA we've become an infamous theater company .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's very high-resolution ,COMMA and it's our algorithms that allow us to zoom in on all the details .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA if we knew exactly what the extra dimensions look like -- we don't yet ,COMMA but if we did -- we should be able to calculate the allowed notes ,COMMA the allowed vibrational patterns .PERIOD <BREAK>
i need you on board .PERIOD i need you with me .PERIOD <BREAK>
more overt ,COMMA the burden of proving that a practice is safe should not be placed on the public that would be harmed ,COMMA but rather on the industry that stands to profit .PERIOD <BREAK>
co <NUM> as a building block .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA in writing for children ,COMMA it seems simple ,COMMA and it is .PERIOD <BREAK>
and then we were able to test them rigorously ,COMMA in random assignment ,COMMA placebo controlled designs ,COMMA throw out the things that didn't work ,COMMA keep the things that actively did .PERIOD <BREAK>
but let me get rid of the slide ,COMMA and let's see if this comes on .PERIOD <BREAK>
because what little hoodlum wouldn't want a million and a half bucks-worth of stolen goods in his pocket .PERIOD <BREAK>
yet actually ,COMMA whenever we talk about human rights ,COMMA we do say that human rights are universal .PERIOD <BREAK>
any particles more massive than this energy limit aren't produced ,COMMA and remain invisible to us .PERIOD <BREAK>
i mean ,COMMA there's water in beer .PERIOD <BREAK>
i really appreciated that .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's hard to get the context and actually get the communication to work .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it came back at <NUM> .PERIOD <NUM> ,COMMA i would say ,COMMA great .PERIOD <BREAK>
and over a few hours ,COMMA i eventually achieved what was actually a pretty reasonable dodo skull .PERIOD and i didn't mean to continue ,COMMA i -- it's kind of like ,COMMA you know ,COMMA you can only clean a super messy room by picking up one thing at a time ;SEMICOLON you can't think about the totality .PERIOD <BREAK>
you learn ,COMMA oh ,COMMA it's a message ,COMMA you know .PERIOD <BREAK>
and this is the piece of paper it will be made from ,COMMA and you can see all of the folds that are needed for it .PERIOD <BREAK>
in other words ,COMMA it's kind of random ,COMMA kind of ad hoc ,COMMA how we figure out what we should do .PERIOD <BREAK>
i ended up with this :COLON my maltese falcon .PERIOD <BREAK>
and then i hear ,COMMA vulnerability ted !EXCLAMATIONMARK <BREAK>
so there's this huge invisible shape structures that magnetism takes in the universe .PERIOD <BREAK>
completely opposite of the way you'd see it on a nature film ,COMMA of course .PERIOD <BREAK>
but you know ,COMMA i think you are familiar with fractals -- the mandelbrot spirals and all these things .PERIOD <BREAK>
if i take <NUM> steps exponentially -- two ,COMMA four ,COMMA eight ,COMMA <NUM> -- i get to a billion .PERIOD <BREAK>
the reason why -- despite all the efforts to cut it down ,COMMA to constrain it ,COMMA to hold it back -- why these open models will still start emerging with tremendous force ,COMMA is that they multiply our productive resources .PERIOD <BREAK>
i'm not going to talk about the skeptical environmentalist -- probably that's also a good choice .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i was other before being anything else -- even before being a girl .PERIOD <BREAK>
so cate says ,COMMA shekhar ,COMMA what do you want me to do ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
that was a great time to go up and visit our weather station which again ,COMMA thanks to mitch kapor ,COMMA we're building up there .PERIOD <BREAK>
and feynman's eyes just opened up .PERIOD <BREAK>
i mean ,COMMA it really was starting to break up .PERIOD <BREAK>
and here comes biology -- biology ,COMMA with its basic question ,COMMA which still stands unanswered ,COMMA which is essentially :COLON if there is life on other planets ,COMMA do we expect it to be like life on earth ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
so the <NUM> th century ,COMMA then ,COMMA saw how much more complex reality was ,COMMA but it also saw a positive side .PERIOD <BREAK>
all right ,COMMA now these are the wha -- i'd say ,COMMA [mumble ,COMMA mumble -- mumble ,COMMA mumble ,COMMA mumble ,COMMA mumble ,COMMA mumble] -- ahh !EXCLAMATIONMARK <BREAK>
it took eight years of blood ,COMMA sweat and tears to reach <NUM> employees ,COMMA something which i was very proud of in the business .PERIOD <BREAK>
the preacher delivered an extra long sermon ,COMMA so that they were still out of harm's way when the wave struck .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is a very lightweight suit .PERIOD it weighs about <NUM> pounds .PERIOD <BREAK>
it doesn't interact with the electromagnetic spectrum ,COMMA which is what we use to detect things .PERIOD <BREAK>
so in <NUM> ,COMMA during my surgical residency ,COMMA i had the great fortune to meet dr .PERIOD roger chen ,COMMA who went on to win the nobel prize for chemistry in <NUM> .PERIOD <BREAK>
and basically our problem is somebody's in the middle of this very long stage ,COMMA they pause for just a moment ,COMMA and they leave something in an enzyme for a second ,COMMA and all of a sudden all the measurements from then on don't work .PERIOD <BREAK>
okay ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
princes patronize the game ,COMMA not because they love the game ,COMMA but because it was a means of ingratiating themselves to the british rulers .PERIOD <BREAK>
follow traces .PERIOD get lost .PERIOD be surprised ,COMMA amused inspired .PERIOD <BREAK>
now ,COMMA i don't know how many of you have ever done that with your kids ,COMMA but if you do ,COMMA please trust me ,COMMA it's the most pressure you can put on a child ,COMMA to say -- -- we trust you that you will always do the right thing .PERIOD <BREAK>
again ,COMMA i'm putting your anterior cingulate cortex to the test here ,COMMA causing you conflicting pattern detections .PERIOD <BREAK>
so i just wanted you to look at this .PERIOD <BREAK>
so the question is :COLON what is the key that's going to allow this to proceed ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and i then became a deprogrammer .PERIOD <BREAK>
and at that time two years ago i mentioned that we were speculating that these jets might in fact be geysers ,COMMA and erupting from pockets or chambers of liquid water underneath the surface ,COMMA but we weren't really sure .PERIOD <BREAK>
how fast ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
this is from the fbi uniform crime statistics .PERIOD you can see that there is a fairly low rate of violence in the ' <NUM> s and the ' <NUM> s ,COMMA then it soared upward for several decades ,COMMA and began a precipitous decline ,COMMA starting in the <NUM> s ,COMMA so that it went back to the level that was last enjoyed in <NUM> .PERIOD <BREAK>
i was born in algeria .PERIOD <BREAK>
but this -- i just want to show you some data here .PERIOD <BREAK>
agnes was a woman who was cut when she was a little girl ,COMMA she was female genitally mutilated .PERIOD <BREAK>
and how i set about that ,COMMA i got some splinters of wood .PERIOD <BREAK>
the vertical elements are assigned a specific hour of the day .PERIOD <BREAK>
we are very happy to have the possibility to be with you in the other side of the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
your choice ,COMMA when living in a city ,COMMA if it's now <NUM> minutes -- because at <NUM> minutes you want an alternative ,COMMA whether it's a bus ,COMMA a train -- we've got to build an infrastructure -- a light rail -- or you're going to keep parking those cars .PERIOD <BREAK>
you know more than benki knew when he left his forest and went <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> miles .PERIOD <BREAK>
everything you need to succeed ,COMMA you already have ,COMMA right here .PERIOD <BREAK>
she went to high school .PERIOD <BREAK>
so we can then predict where management places should be .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's visual .PERIOD it's musical .PERIOD it's sensorial .PERIOD <BREAK>
and like children ,COMMA they believe that we are in severe need of assistance .PERIOD <BREAK>
but it also tells us something about one of these things that we think that we know .PERIOD <BREAK>
please pardon me ,COMMA as a black man ,COMMA for celebrating that the election of obama was an unusual sign of the fact that it is a year of favor .PERIOD <BREAK>
and then i'm going spend perhaps the second half of the talk talking about ,COMMA you know ,COMMA how we might actually be able to prove that fatalism is wrong ,COMMA namely ,COMMA by actually doing something about it .PERIOD <BREAK>
so as food became more plentiful ,COMMA bread became cheaper .PERIOD <BREAK>
now ,COMMA these ideas should apply across the board ,COMMA as long as you can figure out why some organisms evolved to virulence .PERIOD <BREAK>
they were caught by the american soldiers ,COMMA trying to kill americans .PERIOD <BREAK>
we just haven't caught up with the actual realities of this .PERIOD <BREAK>
i mean three companies providing cybersecurity services to the fbi have been hacked .PERIOD <BREAK>
you will say ,COMMA okay ,COMMA this is nice -- a slide created in <NUM> minutes .PERIOD <BREAK>
in india ,COMMA they've got another couple bookmobiles running around .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it still didn't work ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and it describes the same effortless ,COMMA spontaneous feeling that you get when you enter into this ecstatic state .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so i started to argue with these men .PERIOD <BREAK>
yeah .PERIOD the artist doesn't really seem to know where to put the different colors .PERIOD <BREAK>
so good luck .PERIOD we're all in this with you .PERIOD <BREAK>
in so doing ,COMMA i reached a frontier of biology so strange ,COMMA so rich ,COMMA that it seemed as though it exists on another planet .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA you know ,COMMA the thing is to remember that because otherwise ,COMMA <NUM> years from now ,COMMA we'll be back here trying to tell this story again .PERIOD <BREAK>
the other thing is that it's about professionalism .PERIOD <BREAK>
we drive up the street here ,COMMA we find a family here which earns about two to three dollars a day .PERIOD <BREAK>
and if we can do that ,COMMA the sequence of the neurons we recover from that unscrambling will be a prediction of the pattern of neural activity that is replayed in the brain during memory recall .PERIOD <BREAK>
if you're a veteran coming back from iraq or vietnam you face a blizzard of paperwork to get your benefits ;SEMICOLON if you're trying to get a small business loan ,COMMA you face a blizzard of paperwork .PERIOD <BREAK>
there's a water jet that cleans you .PERIOD <BREAK>
ask a room full of teenagers the same thing .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is very ,COMMA very exciting .PERIOD <BREAK>
different people trade off between standing by their outcome ,COMMA faithfully holding to it ,COMMA going down in a blaze of glory ,COMMA or giving it up ,COMMA putting their finger in the wind ,COMMA and doing whatever they think is going to be a winning position .PERIOD <BREAK>
my base of operations is in the u .PERIOD s .PERIOD but let's start at the other end of the map ,COMMA in kyoto ,COMMA japan ,COMMA where i was living with a japanese family while i was doing part of my dissertational research <NUM> years ago .PERIOD <BREAK>
but each of these three objects has value above and beyond what it can do for you based on its history .PERIOD <BREAK>
and what does it mean ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
where there is no trust ,COMMA the music quite simply withers away .PERIOD <BREAK>
so she came to the center ,COMMA and they sedated her and then put her straight into the scanner .PERIOD <BREAK>
well ,COMMA a good guide is to think ,COMMA what did we do last time the rich world got serious about developing another region of the world ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and that's a very plausible idea .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's very tough .PERIOD it's very tough .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i wanted to show several species that we hadn't shown much in the magazine and worked in a number of locations .PERIOD <BREAK>
we want to know how likely ,COMMA or relatively how likely ,COMMA two different explanations are .PERIOD <BREAK>
and for the next three years ,COMMA her fate will be having sex with him every day ,COMMA as a favor for getting her in school .PERIOD <BREAK>
the great graphic designer paul rand designed the ibm logo ,COMMA the westinghouse logo .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is another way that our mind was shifted ,COMMA and twitter wasn't what we thought it was .PERIOD <BREAK>
right ,COMMA it was the first great republican president of the <NUM> th century who taught us about environmental thinking -- teddy roosevelt .PERIOD <BREAK>
when they'd come to visit me ,COMMA they'd look around ,COMMA they'd say ,COMMA this freshman dining hall looks like something out of hogwart's from the movie harry potter ,COMMA which it does .PERIOD <BREAK>
three of them were having incomplete proofs .PERIOD <BREAK>
can i request a moment of absolute silence ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and after <NUM> years of photographing large industrial landscapes ,COMMA it occurred to me that oil is underpinning the scale and speed .PERIOD <BREAK>
you can show a slogan ,COMMA or a symbol ,COMMA or a sign that stands for democracy .PERIOD <BREAK>
we can't see what makes people tick ,COMMA at least not without difficulty .PERIOD <BREAK>
i'll show you in a moment that the stack of paper there would probably hold something like <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> tests ,COMMA something of that kind .PERIOD <BREAK>
now ,COMMA you can try to keep it all inside with drink and drugs and cigarettes ,COMMA but you know that's not going to get you where you want to get .PERIOD <BREAK>
so birds do it too .PERIOD <BREAK>
and where water is liquid ,COMMA it becomes a womb for cells green with chlorophyll -- and that molecular marvel is what's made a difference -- it powers everything .PERIOD <BREAK>
this data's from all over the world -- countries spend billions of dollars investing in this kind of research .PERIOD <BREAK>
so the question that motivates my research is the following :COLON if you look at humanity's large-scale achievements ,COMMA these really big things that humanity has gotten together and done historically -- like for example ,COMMA building the pyramids of egypt or the panama canal or putting a man on the moon -- there is a curious fact about them ,COMMA and it is that they were all done with about the same number off people .PERIOD <BREAK>
so that's all i'm going to say about that .PERIOD <BREAK>
when i was six years old ,COMMA i fell in love with magic .PERIOD <BREAK>
but i want to say that there are two things we need to connect .PERIOD <BREAK>
there are people -- a lady came up to me the other day ,COMMA and she had a white piece of paper -- michael ,COMMA you'll like this one -- and she said ,COMMA what do you see in it ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
this young girl and her friend that i met in an orphanage in delhi were hiv positive from a syringe .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i said ,COMMA i know .PERIOD isn't it fun ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
what i mean by that is that it's time for architecture to do things again ,COMMA not just represent things .PERIOD <BREAK>
the bad news is we don't know exactly what's causing this ,COMMA but here's what you should do ,COMMA here's what we should do .PERIOD <BREAK>
but i've had this forever .PERIOD <BREAK>
that's why i like what i do .PERIOD <BREAK>
one knob is the knob for controlling global temperature .PERIOD <BREAK>
that means each of you will contain on a cd your entire gene code .PERIOD <BREAK>
and will i really say something intelligent ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
this is avery fisher hall ,COMMA but the notion of junk -- visual junk -- was very ,COMMA very important to us ,COMMA to get rid of visual noise .PERIOD <BREAK>
but it turns out that regret feels awful in four very specific and consistent ways .PERIOD <BREAK>
so even in the situation that doesn't look as bad as this ,COMMA it's still affecting the amount of time these animals have to do their normal work .PERIOD <BREAK>
another three seconds ,COMMA one more .PERIOD <BREAK>
ladies and gentlemen ,COMMA that's my story .PERIOD <BREAK>
the information they get gets filtered through somebody who either twists that information ,COMMA or colors that information ,COMMA does something with it .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's because of this that you need the magnetic braking system .PERIOD <BREAK>
so eight minutes and an embedded computer seemed to be all that we needed there .PERIOD <BREAK>
for the first time in human history -- and barring aliens landing or some major other pandemic ,COMMA that's the expectation from demographers ,COMMA going forward .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is not always good ,COMMA because what is your perfect world ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
here is a letter of friendly advice .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i just wanted to show you .PERIOD <BREAK>
what you're getting is a world which is old folks ,COMMA and old cities ,COMMA going around doing things the old way ,COMMA in the north .PERIOD <BREAK>
well it may be ,COMMA but i will say that ,COMMA from a scientific perspective -- we talked a lot about innovation today -- the science of innovation ,COMMA how much we understand about how the brain is able to innovate is in its infancy ,COMMA and truly ,COMMA we know very little about how we are able to be creative .PERIOD <BREAK>
now what i'm also interested in is :COLON is it possible to separate intrinsic and extrinsic beauty ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and he said ,COMMA do you love it ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
we'd been working there about a month .PERIOD <BREAK>
so that's my dirty little secret .PERIOD don't tell anyone .PERIOD <BREAK>
little froggy legs .PERIOD <BREAK>
the one in front ,COMMA the smaller ,COMMA is strider ii .PERIOD <BREAK>
the creek had been culverted under the parking lot .PERIOD <BREAK>
the change in oxytocin predicted their feelings of empathy .PERIOD <BREAK>
they provide opportunities to be more physically active ,COMMA as well as local economic development .PERIOD <BREAK>
that is just to understand how big and important this problem is .PERIOD <BREAK>
the next thing we need are places to stay on orbit .PERIOD <BREAK>
i'm a writer and a journalist ,COMMA and i'm also an insanely curious person ,COMMA so in <NUM> years as a journalist ,COMMA i've learned how to do a lot of new things .PERIOD <BREAK>
so first of all we did deals with <NUM> different countries .PERIOD <BREAK>
they kidnapped her ,COMMA they put her in a car .PERIOD <BREAK>
we are not here to question the possible ;SEMICOLON we are here to challenge the impossible .PERIOD <BREAK>
i mean ,COMMA look :COLON if you can show instead of just describing ,COMMA that problem goes away .PERIOD <BREAK>
population times consumption has got to have some kind of relationship to the planet ,COMMA and right now ,COMMA it's a simple not equal .PERIOD <BREAK>
so as your model is close to reality ,COMMA and it converges with feelings ,COMMA you often don't know it's there .PERIOD <BREAK>
there's a situation where errors in statistics had really profound and really unfortunate consequences .PERIOD <BREAK>
and what the missionaries would do is ,COMMA they'd walk around and they'd pick up hyena shit .PERIOD <BREAK>
but the beauty is that is was installed by a priest ,COMMA a hindu priest ,COMMA who's only done eight years of primary schooling -- never been to school ,COMMA never been to college .PERIOD <BREAK>
i watched the man open a pack of cigarettes with trembling hands and offer one to her ,COMMA and that is the image of the night of the earthquake in my mind today -- a conservative grocer and a crying transvestite smoking together on the sidewalk .PERIOD <BREAK>
my fellow environmentalists ,COMMA on this subject ,COMMA have been irrational ,COMMA anti-scientific ,COMMA and very harmful .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is like ,COMMA if you're familiar with any of the telepresence robots today -- this is mirroring that situation .PERIOD <BREAK>
i went to his home town .PERIOD <BREAK>
so you have the prefrontal cortex here ,COMMA lighting up in red .PERIOD <BREAK>
i began talking with people who actually had been out to the gyre and were studying the plastic problem in the marine environment and upon doing so ,COMMA i realized actually that cleaning it up would be a very small drop in the bucket relative to how much is being generated every day around the world ,COMMA and that actually i needed to back up and look at the bigger picture .PERIOD <BREAK>
and if they had some infrastructure ,COMMA they have difficulty maintaining it .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's really up to us .PERIOD <BREAK>
you go through some additional checks ,COMMA and then they open the door .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i think inspired by that memory ,COMMA it's been my desire to try and bring it to as many other people as i can ,COMMA sort of pass it on through whatever means .PERIOD <BREAK>
but ,COMMA you know ,COMMA it's very easy to overlook the smaller characters -- oops -- for example ,COMMA like lem sen ,COMMA who introduced chop suey ,COMMA chef peng ,COMMA who introduced general tso chicken ,COMMA and all the japanese bakers who introduced fortune cookies .PERIOD <BREAK>
and once that happened ,COMMA they were out in the city convincing everybody that child labor just had to be abolished .PERIOD <BREAK>
if you love your enemy that means you want your enemy to be happy .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i'm very pleased to tell you that the building's done .PERIOD <BREAK>
thanks very much .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so we spent a good deal of our time indicating that .PERIOD <BREAK>
or for the blind ,COMMA everyday home appliances -- in the educational setting ,COMMA in the office setting .PERIOD <BREAK>
in fact ,COMMA in the area where she comes from ,COMMA more than <NUM> percent of the tasmanian devil population has already died of this disease .PERIOD <BREAK>
our ability to imagine makes us inventors and creators and unique .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i look at eduardo ,COMMA who's near tears looking at this ,COMMA and i say ,COMMA you're telling me that your geese are calling to the wild geese to say come for a visit ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
so i went back that very summer .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it is detectable not just in amino acids .PERIOD <BREAK>
given my status ,COMMA what is the best outcome i can hope to achieve ,COMMA and how do i get there ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
none of it makes very much sense .PERIOD <BREAK>
a lot of this comes from the fact that the industrial city in america was such a trauma that we developed this tremendous aversion for the whole idea of the city ,COMMA city life ,COMMA and everything connected with it .PERIOD <BREAK>
it is organic ,COMMA across our religious ,COMMA spiritual and ethical traditions ,COMMA and yet it transcends them .PERIOD <BREAK>
but let me introduce you to the one who is most at risk here .PERIOD <BREAK>
i remember ,COMMA every time i went to a patient's deathbed ,COMMA whether in the hospital or at home ,COMMA i remember my sense of failure -- the feeling of i don't know what i have to say ;SEMICOLON i don't know what i can say ;SEMICOLON i don't know what i'm supposed to do .PERIOD <BREAK>
so basically ,COMMA the number of pages that mention this term ,COMMA that also mention this page ,COMMA the percentage of those pages is that person's google share of that term .PERIOD <BREAK>
they turned the ships into hotels ,COMMA because they couldn't sail them anywhere .PERIOD <BREAK>
and if there are things that we see that we don't like about our culture ,COMMA then we have a choice .PERIOD <BREAK>
now let's take a look at hiv .PERIOD <BREAK>
so you can see :COLON here we are in the u .PERIOD s .PERIOD and they're all coming up red .PERIOD <BREAK>
we try to cash in on it .PERIOD <BREAK>
okay so ,COMMA in my world ,COMMA what do we need to do ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
you fall outside the door ,COMMA you're caught in the slipstream .PERIOD <BREAK>
i lived in ireland ,COMMA built the first straw-bale houses in ireland ,COMMA and some cob buildings and all this kind of thing .PERIOD <BREAK>
they could outsource all their problems -- protection from predators ,COMMA food finding ,COMMA health maintenance .PERIOD <BREAK>
if we invest about <NUM> billion dollars ,COMMA we could make a severe inroad into that problem .PERIOD <BREAK>
and this is just a selection of things that were built in the last couple of years .PERIOD <BREAK>
and a year before that i was a pack-a-day smoker ,COMMA living a very sedentary lifestyle .PERIOD <BREAK>
the one glacier up in greenland that puts more ice into the global ocean than all the other glaciers in the northern hemisphere combined is the ilulissat glacier .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's a wild concept .PERIOD <BREAK>
so i sent this company an email saying ,COMMA hello .PERIOD i'm christien .PERIOD i'm doing this research .PERIOD <BREAK>
and that’s how your body excretes waste ,COMMA is through your breath ,COMMA your bowels and your perspiration .PERIOD <BREAK>
and here he is ,COMMA flapping with his ears and very gracefully going up .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's a technical tour de force .PERIOD <BREAK>
that's the same species .PERIOD <BREAK>
they put them about one inch above the ground ,COMMA and then they shut everything off and they go pfft .PERIOD <BREAK>
so this is really ,COMMA really nice ,COMMA and i think this is a great tool .PERIOD <BREAK>
well ,COMMA first of all ,COMMA let me thank emeka -- as a matter of fact ,COMMA ted global -- for putting this conference together .PERIOD <BREAK>
now if i asked you to predict one more letter ,COMMA what do you think that would be ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
she was my childhood friend .PERIOD <BREAK>
so the first thing we need to do with the cognitive suite is to start with training a neutral signal .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it gives me a lot of hope .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA i've been working as a data journalist for about a year ,COMMA and i keep hearing a phrase all the time ,COMMA which is this :COLON data is the new oil .PERIOD <BREAK>
so let's give this a try .PERIOD <BREAK>
what's unexpected about this is that it's soft ,COMMA but it's also a strong magnet .PERIOD <BREAK>
i don't know who needs a corn sheller .PERIOD <BREAK>
i headed the middle east peace process section in the british foreign ministry .PERIOD <BREAK>
so instead of using carbon from oil for synthetic processes ,COMMA we have the chance of using carbon and capturing it back from the atmosphere ,COMMA converting that into biopolymers or other products .PERIOD <BREAK>
but this is not really mass customization ;SEMICOLON it's known as variant production ,COMMA variations of the same product .PERIOD <BREAK>
so if you want to unmask a true look of happiness ,COMMA you will look for this expression .PERIOD <BREAK>
i just couldn't believe the poetry of all of it -- these souls all on their own desert island ,COMMA sending electronic messages in bottles to each other .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it wouldn’t be interesting to talk about the dawn of books without having a copy of a guttenberg bible .PERIOD <BREAK>
the crisis is almost certainly deepening around us .PERIOD <BREAK>
now ,COMMA what good are springy legs then ?QUESTIONMARK what can they do ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
they have no benefits :COLON they don't have social security ;SEMICOLON they don't have pension ;SEMICOLON they don't have healthcare ;SEMICOLON none of those things .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i designed three operas with him ,COMMA and the most recent one ,COMMA king arthur .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the parallels between the events of <NUM> bc and <NUM> and in between are startling .PERIOD <BREAK>
that little issue took the team two years to solve .PERIOD <BREAK>
well ,COMMA as you all know ,COMMA not many of us believe we do .PERIOD <BREAK>
well ,COMMA when i saw this in the front page of the times ,COMMA i thought ,COMMA great .PERIOD finally something i can relate to .PERIOD <BREAK>
how do you put it in a nice little software ?QUESTIONMARK you can't .PERIOD <BREAK>
about six years ago ,COMMA i bought one of these cnc mills ,COMMA to just replace ,COMMA kind of ,COMMA young people cutting their fingers off all the time building models .PERIOD <BREAK>
they didn't want to sell pirate supplies .PERIOD <BREAK>
would that make us more responsible for what is happening today ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
about three and a half years ago i made a discovery .PERIOD <BREAK>
why does this happen ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
this is still the way we're communicating messages about health .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it's been slow coming ,COMMA and we're only making about <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> a week ,COMMA but we hope ,COMMA we hope ,COMMA sometime in next year ,COMMA maybe by the middle of the year ,COMMA to hit a million a month .PERIOD now put that number ,COMMA and a million isn't so much .PERIOD it's not a big number .PERIOD <BREAK>
and that ,COMMA in some ways ,COMMA was the best job you could hope to get if you were growing up in one of these neighborhoods as a young black male .PERIOD <BREAK>
when incentives don't work ,COMMA when ceos ignore the long-term health of their companies in pursuit of short-term gains that will lead to massive bonuses ,COMMA the response is always the same .PERIOD <BREAK>
well folks ,COMMA i'm here to tell you that the world has completely changed and none of you know about it .PERIOD <BREAK>
so i'm going to show you a demo of this .PERIOD <BREAK>
it does the circle packing ,COMMA calculates the crease pattern ,COMMA and if you use that stick figure that i just showed -- which you can kind of tell ,COMMA it's a deer ,COMMA it's got antlers -- you'll get this crease pattern .PERIOD <BREAK>
but i'm not ashamed of my self .PERIOD <BREAK>
that's fantastic .PERIOD <BREAK>
but i tell you what .PERIOD it doesn't work for me to go on with this thing ,COMMA with such a wide gulf between those who understand ,COMMA love and [are] passionate about classical music ,COMMA and those who have no relationship to it at all .PERIOD <BREAK>
and he pointed at the screen ,COMMA he said ,COMMA he's in that firefight .PERIOD <BREAK>
none of us ,COMMA i think ,COMMA want human progress to stop .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's not even clear that a drug could cause this to be restored ,COMMA because there's nothing for the drug to bind to .PERIOD <BREAK>
you can't just look at the dessert cart as say ,COMMA no ,COMMA no ,COMMA no .PERIOD that looks disgusting to me .PERIOD <BREAK>
if not ,COMMA one or the other needs upgrading ,COMMA isn't it ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
glenn gould ,COMMA <NUM> .PERIOD <BREAK>
i was to address a conference at a hotel .PERIOD <BREAK>
don't you feel one step closer already ,COMMA like it's already becoming part of your identity ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and so we were rowing ,COMMA and one of these western grebes came along .PERIOD <BREAK>
now ,COMMA is there any way to see through this blindfold ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
the manufacturers are -- the domestics are usually -- you can tell a domestic factory by the fact that they all use the same color uniforms .PERIOD <BREAK>
you can copy this tattoo .PERIOD i have some posters of this .PERIOD <BREAK>
people like kenneth miller could be called a godsend to the evolution lobby -- -- because they expose the lie that evolutionism is ,COMMA as a matter of fact ,COMMA tantamount to atheism .PERIOD <BREAK>
so i've been working on the idea of computation now for more than <NUM> years ,COMMA building tools and methods and turning intellectual ideas into millions of lines of code and grist for server farms and so on .PERIOD <BREAK>
what we found ,COMMA however ,COMMA was that they took an extremely long time -- over <NUM> years -- to regenerate ,COMMA starting from the bottom and growing up .PERIOD <BREAK>
there are three featured in the film .PERIOD <BREAK>
a car is a similar object ,COMMA and they can get in a car and drive it .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's completely fucked up and can only be explained in song .PERIOD <BREAK>
from <NUM> to <NUM> ,COMMA grown easy and sly ,COMMA i wined them and dined them ,COMMA like pigs in a sty .PERIOD <BREAK>
we can recreate this using a process of group dynamics to explain the patterns that we see all around the conflicts around the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
government ,COMMA well ,COMMA one thing that comes to mind is the u .PERIOD s .PERIOD government ,COMMA among others ,COMMA is literally starting to pay people to lose weight .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i said ,COMMA do you really ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and so there were many ,COMMA many of these kinds of projects .PERIOD <BREAK>
people are horrible at estimating both of these things ,COMMA and that's what i want to talk to you about today .PERIOD <BREAK>
after him followed the post-modern counter-revolution ,COMMA robert venturi saying ,COMMA less is a bore .PERIOD <BREAK>
now ,COMMA it works just like a regular phone .PERIOD <BREAK>
there's a prophesy .PERIOD you have to save the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
and to do this ,COMMA i knew that i had to see the way in which artists work ,COMMA understand the artist's studio as a laboratory ,COMMA imagine ,COMMA then ,COMMA reinventing the museum as a think tank and looking at the exhibition as the ultimate white paper -- asking questions ,COMMA providing the space to look and to think about answers .PERIOD <BREAK>
if you did this ,COMMA more people would save more .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA i think i'm going to leave it at that :COLON the robots are coming ,COMMA we don't have too much to worry about ,COMMA it's going to be a lot of fun ,COMMA and i hope you all enjoy the journey over the next <NUM> years .PERIOD <BREAK>
and we've know for a long time that this is not a good measure of the welfare of nations .PERIOD <BREAK>
their name in your inbox -- it's all you wanted anyway .PERIOD <BREAK>
this boy is called sadik .PERIOD <BREAK>
where does it go inside the body ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
my family's poor ,COMMA my area don't have better health care .PERIOD <BREAK>
but we do have the potential to overcome disease and poverty ,COMMA and i'm going to talk about those issues ,COMMA if we have the will .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's known by some people in new haven ,COMMA obviously ,COMMA but it is not generally known .PERIOD <BREAK>
then the spray dries .PERIOD it turns into powder .PERIOD <BREAK>
we've got to do whatever we can to help them ,COMMA but we've also got to ask ,COMMA i think ,COMMA a more profound question of whether we use this crisis to jump forward to a different kind of economy that's more suited to human needs ,COMMA to a better balance of economy and society .PERIOD <BREAK>
that will happen because women in cairo made a decision to stand up and put themselves on the line ,COMMA and talk about the degree of violence that is happening in egypt ,COMMA and were willing to be attacked and criticized .PERIOD <BREAK>
so if i throw my towel in the washing machine ,COMMA i've now put energy and water back into that towel .PERIOD <BREAK>
so we said ,COMMA well ,COMMA these will be on round tables and the order around the table had to be the same ,COMMA so that at my site ,COMMA i would be ,COMMA if you will ,COMMA real and then at each other's site you'd have these plastic heads .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so ,COMMA with this sort of idea ,COMMA what happens is ,COMMA whatever actually is in the building on opening day ,COMMA or whatever seems to be the most immediate need ,COMMA starts to dwarf the possibility and sort of subsume it ,COMMA of anything else could ever happen .PERIOD <BREAK>
but ,COMMA using the language of galois ,COMMA we can understand that the underlying abstract symmetries of these things are actually the same .PERIOD <BREAK>
this photograph is very important because it's much later .PERIOD <BREAK>
you’re going to find out why in a minute ,COMMA because when i went to see eileen ,COMMA this is what i said i wanted to build .PERIOD <BREAK>
this was one of the groups .PERIOD <BREAK>
soft power is a concept invented by a harvard academic ,COMMA joseph nye ,COMMA a friend of mine .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's funny ,COMMA isn't it ?QUESTIONMARK it's funny how those thoughts kind of waft into your head .PERIOD <BREAK>
if they're bad ,COMMA they're your creation .PERIOD learn from it .PERIOD <BREAK>
you can see that in health and education ,COMMA a large part of the world population is putting forward ,COMMA but in africa ,COMMA and other parts ,COMMA as in rural guizhou in china ,COMMA there is still people with low health and very low economy .PERIOD <BREAK>
so was martin luther king ,COMMA jr .PERIOD so was dorothy day .PERIOD <BREAK>
but then if you think about it ,COMMA the squid has this terrible problem because it's got this dying ,COMMA thick culture of bacteria and it can't sustain that .PERIOD <BREAK>
anybody ?QUESTIONMARK boy you're lucky .PERIOD <BREAK>
the market is not alien to africa .PERIOD <BREAK>
i want to know what the driver is .PERIOD <BREAK>
small country ,COMMA not so rich .PERIOD president said he'd do it ,COMMA and guess what ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
galvani's approach of probing the nervous system with electrodes has remained state-of-the-art until today ,COMMA despite a number of drawbacks .PERIOD <BREAK>
so that's really cool -- you can take it to london or siberia ,COMMA and your next door neighbor can dial your home number and your phone will ring ,COMMA because it's got everything in the box .PERIOD <BREAK>
i feel skinny ,COMMA but i'm not .PERIOD <BREAK>
he was a troubled kid .PERIOD <BREAK>
she's working her way through college .PERIOD <BREAK>
now ,COMMA to show that we could make any shape or pattern that we wanted ,COMMA i tried to make this shape .PERIOD <BREAK>
people would look at these and say ,COMMA man ,COMMA this thing is so big and so hard to swallow .PERIOD if this doesn't make me feel better ,COMMA you know ,COMMA what possibly could ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
now ,COMMA that free time existed in the <NUM> th century ,COMMA but we didn't get ushahidi in the <NUM> th century .PERIOD <BREAK>
a land where every field hides a grave ,COMMA where millions of people have been deported or killed in the <NUM> th century .PERIOD <BREAK>
let's create a word processor that's just a word processor .PERIOD <BREAK>
the yeast comes alive and starts eating the sugars ,COMMA creating carbon dioxide and alcohol -- essentially it's burping and sweating ,COMMA which is what bread is .PERIOD <BREAK>
it might take a long time .PERIOD nobody wrote down the rules clearly .PERIOD <BREAK>
because we doctors do what we get paid to do ,COMMA and we get trained to do what we get paid to do ,COMMA so if we change insurance ,COMMA then we change medical practice and medical education .PERIOD <BREAK>
we had them engineered by the engineers .PERIOD <BREAK>
and then you can maybe wash the dna away and have the circuit left over .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's you and i who make our fates -- we open up or close the gates on the road ahead or the road behind .PERIOD <BREAK>
well ,COMMA lets go back to the <NUM> th century .PERIOD <BREAK>
when we studied these data ,COMMA we found evidence for all of these things ,COMMA including for induction .PERIOD <BREAK>
tom otterness contributed ,COMMA maira kalman contributed and it became this cathartic experience for us .PERIOD <BREAK>
now over the last couple of years ,COMMA we've gone back to the tree of life because we wanted to find ways to turn circuits in the brain off .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is a three-year-old orphan girl who had cataracts .PERIOD <BREAK>
so some steps that we can take -- to finish up -- how to make this revolution through play .PERIOD <BREAK>
her dream of going to school ,COMMA her wish of being educated ,COMMA is finally here .PERIOD <BREAK>
and also ,COMMA it was kind of interesting that god needed help .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's downtowns becoming ghost towns .PERIOD <BREAK>
you have to go to youtube and type in iphone shuffle .PERIOD <BREAK>
phone :COLON did you complete that thing about a month ago ?QUESTIONMARK that photocopier training ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
you're going to hear stories of africa :COLON the next chapter .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is me :COLON <NUM> -plus .PERIOD <BREAK>
but ,COMMA instead of devouring the people in the shop ,COMMA what it's doing is overgrowing and smothering virtually all of the bottom-dwelling life of the entire northwestern mediterranean sea .PERIOD <BREAK>
all of that could be described using newton's work .PERIOD <BREAK>
as he said to me ,COMMA that really pissed the french off .PERIOD <BREAK>
but it soon became clear that abraham lincoln would emerge as the undisputed captain of this unruly team .PERIOD <BREAK>
the other thing we discovered is that efficiency doesn't matter so much if your energy source is free .PERIOD <BREAK>
i mean ,COMMA on the slide ,COMMA you can see that on our sensitive side ,COMMA these cells that are responding to the drug ,COMMA when we start blocking the protein ,COMMA the number of dying cells -- those colored dots -- they're going down .PERIOD <BREAK>
so that encouraged him ,COMMA and he went with maitreya .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i realized ,COMMA wow ,COMMA this would really make a big difference ,COMMA if we could do it ,COMMA and so i said ,COMMA well ,COMMA let's look at it .PERIOD <BREAK>
i read all the books in english and go to most of the lectures .PERIOD <BREAK>
he believed that he could ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA catalog the human face .PERIOD <BREAK>
i've gone and had an fmri myself ,COMMA to see how my visual cortex is taking over .PERIOD <BREAK>
and other studies of populations at risk sensitized me to the importance of play ,COMMA but i didn't really understand what it was .PERIOD <BREAK>
you know frank gehry's buildings ,COMMA they will continue to be unexpected in the future .PERIOD <BREAK>
when we focus on ourselves in any activity ,COMMA we do turn that part of ourselves off if there's another person .PERIOD <BREAK>
sometimes instead of control-z ,COMMA we actually have zero control .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA we try to get to the door ,COMMA and we run to the door ,COMMA and we open the door and it's like walking into a blast furnace .PERIOD <BREAK>
they were happy because the story survived ,COMMA and that the world would keep on spinning .PERIOD <BREAK>
so it felt this has a social dimension .PERIOD <BREAK>
we have only ,COMMA in government and in politics ,COMMA started to scratch the surface of what people are doing in the commercial world with the information revolution .PERIOD <BREAK>
we're not just talking about a few videos ,COMMA we're talking about over <NUM> years of video every day ,COMMA between new uploads and the legacy scans we regularly do across all of the content on the site .PERIOD <BREAK>
or you could actually meet my need .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's a new university in california ,COMMA in the central valley ,COMMA working very closely with community colleges .PERIOD <BREAK>
so clear .PERIOD maybe a little bit over-clear .PERIOD <BREAK>
pull it so you can't even see down .PERIOD <BREAK>
it means large-scale hydraulic fracking for gas and massive strip-mining operations for coal ,COMMA the likes of which we haven't yet seen .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i say ,COMMA yes ,COMMA they're all for you .PERIOD <BREAK>
what sea level rise can we look forward to ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
oh -- yours does ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
if we take <NUM> kilograms of food -- and it results in one kilogram of beef ,COMMA the other nine kilograms are waste ,COMMA and a lot of that is manure .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i'm trying harder and harder .PERIOD <BREAK>
maybe it was just that they could put sugar in their tea and offer that to me when i came as their guest and that made them feel proud .PERIOD <BREAK>
but i asked him :COLON when are you going to finish it ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
but moses ,COMMA if you saw the movie ,COMMA the ten commandments ,COMMA moses goes out ,COMMA and there's this burning bush ,COMMA and god talks to him .PERIOD <BREAK>
however ,COMMA your brain isn't doubling every two years .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i stumbled across something called cancer stem cells .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's gotten so simple that it's already starting to kind of come back the other way again and get a little more expressive .PERIOD <BREAK>
and actually ,COMMA chris called me a week after i'd given my talk and he said ,COMMA we're going to start putting them online .PERIOD <BREAK>
and therefore ,COMMA i began to not only try to protect the work of the world bank ,COMMA our own projects ,COMMA our own programs against corruption ,COMMA but in general ,COMMA i thought ,COMMA we need a system to protect the people in this part of the world from the ravages of corruption .PERIOD <BREAK>
i went out and i worked at a non-profit ,COMMA i went to grad school ,COMMA i phone-banked ,COMMA i protested ,COMMA i volunteered ,COMMA and none of it seemed to matter .PERIOD <BREAK>
and she begins to babble and coo and smile ,COMMA and so does the baby .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it was not until galileo actually did it that an adult thought like a child ,COMMA only <NUM> years ago .PERIOD <BREAK>
and in fact barack obama did quite well .PERIOD <BREAK>
we set up carpet-weaving units ,COMMA vocational training for the women .PERIOD <BREAK>
i want to hack into these things i know are important and lay the code out for everyone to see .PERIOD <BREAK>
on the left hand side ,COMMA there's a new type of mooring ,COMMA which i'll show you in just a second .PERIOD <BREAK>
i went to afghanistan in <NUM> to work on a financial times piece ,COMMA and there i met kamila ,COMMA a young women who told me she had just turned down a job with the international community that would have paid her nearly $ <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> a month -- an astronomical sum in that context .PERIOD <BREAK>
because dragonflies need fresh water to breed .PERIOD <BREAK>
the final project i'd like to show you is a new interface for fish that has just been launched -- it's actually officially launched next week -- with a wonderful commission from the architectural league .PERIOD <BREAK>
and any time one of those little parts of the mobile changes ,COMMA is touched ,COMMA any time you touch a word ,COMMA you use it in a new context ,COMMA you give it a new connotation ,COMMA you verb it ,COMMA you make the mobile move .PERIOD <BREAK>
you said ,COMMA now everything automatically goes from my iphone ,COMMA but actually you do take the pictures and put on information .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's two resins that are ,COMMA sort of ,COMMA in and of themselves -- neither of which can make glue ,COMMA but when you put the two together ,COMMA something happens .PERIOD a bond takes place ,COMMA and you get this very strong ,COMMA powerful adhesive .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA looking at other parts of europe's periphery ,COMMA such as north africa .PERIOD <BREAK>
so what i was trying to do is think of a way that we could study suspended animation to think about a way to reproduce ,COMMA maybe ,COMMA what happened to the skier .PERIOD <BREAK>
there is one case that we have begun to understand better ,COMMA and it's the case of fireflies .PERIOD <BREAK>
she said ,COMMA i have defended more than a hundred people ,COMMA and i've never had to do any investigation ,COMMA because they all come with confessions .PERIOD <BREAK>
that allows you to get the efficiency up from a hundredth of a percent to about two percent .PERIOD <BREAK>
what about a skunk ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
so even though when the powder was poison ,COMMA the friend drank the coffee and died ,COMMA people say grace deserves less blame in that case ,COMMA when she innocently thought it was sugar ,COMMA than in the other case ,COMMA where she thought it was poison and no harm occurred .PERIOD <BREAK>
so this is a catastrophe .PERIOD <BREAK>
and when you touch it with your finger ,COMMA you can actually ,COMMA then ,COMMA introduce all the forces on the face of that screen ,COMMA and that actually has a certain amount of value .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the fundamental problem is we don't actually have a word for this stuff .PERIOD <BREAK>
because instead of taking weeks to months to make these ,COMMA dan's team can now make these in less than <NUM> hours .PERIOD <BREAK>
so what is this impossible hyperbolic structure ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
this is the collect pond ,COMMA which was the fresh water source for new york city for its first <NUM> years ,COMMA and for the native americans for thousands of years before that .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so ,COMMA you have these grand rituals where great images of mother goddesses are built and worshiped for <NUM> days .PERIOD <BREAK>
and in this slide you see the neurons and the synapses of the brain don't form .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's really too boring whether you feel like this or like that ,COMMA or what ,COMMA you know -- and the more you focus on how you feel ,COMMA by the way ,COMMA the worse it gets .PERIOD <BREAK>
the mistake of the international aid industry is to pick these isolated incidents of success ,COMMA generalize them ,COMMA pour billions and trillions of dollars into them ,COMMA and then spread them across the whole world ,COMMA ignoring the specific and unique circumstances in a given village ,COMMA the skills ,COMMA the practices ,COMMA the norms and habits that allowed that small aid project to succeed -- like in sauri village ,COMMA in kenya ,COMMA where jeffrey sachs is working -- and therefore generalize this experience as the experience of everybody .PERIOD <BREAK>
he's got a reason not to get involved .PERIOD <BREAK>
for every <NUM> girls with a learning disability ,COMMA there are <NUM> boys .PERIOD <BREAK>
and there is whole chains of neurons around this room ,COMMA talking to each other .PERIOD <BREAK>
but we know about those things .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's a simple idea about nature .PERIOD <BREAK>
and one thing about cars is we're all a little bit like pygmalion ,COMMA we are completely in love with our own creations .PERIOD <BREAK>
because they know that that is one sure way to do carbon-free energy .PERIOD <BREAK>
then i would go up and deliver them to these <NUM> -year-old women playing bridge .PERIOD <BREAK>
and you see this behavior on amazon as surely as you see it on wall street .PERIOD <BREAK>
stefan sagmeister :COLON thank you .PERIOD <BREAK>
but actually i think the most exciting thing about this is that it really gives one the chance to democratize programming .PERIOD <BREAK>
got rejected by all except one .PERIOD <BREAK>
in the setting of prostate cancer ,COMMA up to <NUM> percent of men after prostate cancer surgery may have urinary incontinence and erectile disfunction .PERIOD <BREAK>
there's the ocean maps you can see on the left .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i'd say that it deserves ,COMMA in the spirit of wade davis' talk ,COMMA to be at least put up there with these wonderful creation stories of the peoples of the high andes and the frozen north .PERIOD <BREAK>
and given that it takes three times as much grain -- actually ten times as much grain -- to feed a human if it's passed through an animal first ,COMMA that's not a very efficient way of feeding us .PERIOD <BREAK>
it is emphatically an outdoor public room .PERIOD <BREAK>
so it's sort of ellis island ,COMMA and seeing america for the first time .PERIOD <BREAK>
some people will find very scary .PERIOD i will tell you a couple of things that will probably make you want to projectile puke on me ,COMMA but that's okay .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA these are the civic leaders of the future .PERIOD <BREAK>
and out of that field campaign we'll probably get a few dozen papers on a few dozen processes or molecules .PERIOD <BREAK>
whereas u .PERIOD k .PERIOD and united states is getting richer and richer .PERIOD <BREAK>
so is london a scaled up birmingham ,COMMA which is a scaled up brighton ,COMMA etc .PERIOD etc .PERIOD <BREAK>
and basically what you'll see is what economists talk about as the polarization of the economy .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so i came back with that news to cambridge ,COMMA and bragg said ,COMMA build models .PERIOD <BREAK>
the kids got the pills ,COMMA and then their performance improved .PERIOD <BREAK>
and david won't take no .PERIOD <BREAK>
most of the information that we collected on the cholera outbreak didn't come from testing water ;SEMICOLON it came from forms like this ,COMMA which documented all the people we failed to help .PERIOD <BREAK>
the remarkable thing to us is that ,COMMA when you give monkeys this choice ,COMMA they do the same irrational thing that people do .PERIOD <BREAK>
so i wanted to create a fictional character or an animal that dwells in these underground spaces ,COMMA and the simplest way to do it ,COMMA at the time ,COMMA was to model myself .PERIOD <BREAK>
yes ,COMMA it does -- quite wonderfully .PERIOD <BREAK>
so there is a form of internal globalization which is happening ,COMMA which is as important as external globalization .PERIOD <BREAK>
especially if you're hungry and your kids are hungry and your neighbor's kids are hungry and your whole neighborhood is hungry ,COMMA you're pretty angry .PERIOD <BREAK>
so bearing that in mind ,COMMA as a chemist ,COMMA i wanted to ask myself the question frustrated by biology :COLON what is the minimal unit of matter that can undergo darwinian evolution ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
we're building a new city next to this city ;SEMICOLON look at that landscape .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's big ,COMMA it's heavy .PERIOD you can't carry it away ,COMMA so you bang it with your hammer ,COMMA and you break off a piece .PERIOD <BREAK>
and this turns out to have a special power all its own ,COMMA because people could feel that these leaders were at the helm ,COMMA not because they enjoyed directing others and not out of the pleasure of being looked at ;SEMICOLON they were there because they had no choice ,COMMA because they were driven to do what they thought was right .PERIOD <BREAK>
and its shape is what gives it the function of being able to tumble through air so easily .PERIOD look at that shape .PERIOD <BREAK>
well ,COMMA again ,COMMA the schematic view is that the eye visually interrogates what we look at .PERIOD <BREAK>
look at this green spike in <NUM> to a bellwether show .PERIOD <BREAK>
is it a product of natural selection ,COMMA like our hands ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
so ,COMMA what about that ?QUESTIONMARK well ,COMMA here's a couple of things .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the logic of our experiment was simple .PERIOD <BREAK>
thank you .PERIOD <BREAK>
but if rube goldberg machines and video poetry aren't quite your cup of tea ,COMMA how about this .PERIOD <BREAK>
what it means is the mother and child stay under the bed net at night ,COMMA so the mosquitoes that bite late at night can't get at them .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is amazing ,COMMA i think .PERIOD <BREAK>
now by noise ,COMMA i do not mean sound .PERIOD <BREAK>
we don't know .PERIOD <BREAK>
so you use it with your headset .PERIOD <BREAK>
there are many reasons ,COMMA but the two that merit the little bit of time is :COLON one ,COMMA the clarity of purpose is there .PERIOD the moral purpose is clear .PERIOD <BREAK>
here's what some of this data might look like .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so i will finish by showing you a new city we're designing for the chinese government .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it's those who start with why that have the ability to inspire those around them or find others who inspire them .PERIOD <BREAK>
and under no load ,COMMA it's one structure .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the marrow miner ,COMMA the way it works is shown here .PERIOD <BREAK>
we believe in thinking differently .PERIOD <BREAK>
when did this happen ?QUESTIONMARK we don't know ,COMMA but it's possible that neanderthals didn't do this .PERIOD <BREAK>
maybe you can relieve the phantom pain ,COMMA the phantom cramp .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA the next time they tell you they're on to something ,COMMA clearly they're not .PERIOD <BREAK>
through haiti rewired ,COMMA through build change ,COMMA architecture for humanity ,COMMA aidg ,COMMA there is the possibility to reach out to <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> -- <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> masons across the country and create a movement of proper building .PERIOD <BREAK>
we go into rural communities and all we do ,COMMA like has been done in this room ,COMMA is create the space .PERIOD <BREAK>
the way we sent drawings to japan :COLON we used the magic computer in michigan that does carved models ,COMMA and we used to make foam models ,COMMA which that thing scanned .PERIOD <BREAK>
or ,COMMA more specifically ,COMMA what we learned from the creation of a very large and complicated machine for a music video .PERIOD <BREAK>
and in that moment ,COMMA i would be able to reattach to normal reality and i could tell that's not the card .PERIOD that's not the card .PERIOD that's not the card .PERIOD <BREAK>
there's a lot of gender differences ;SEMICOLON anybody who thinks men and women are alike simply never had a boy and a girl child .PERIOD <BREAK>
right ?QUESTIONMARK so they can go online and contribute ideas on what that region would look like by the year <NUM> .PERIOD <BREAK>
and cantor decided he was going to take a line and erase the middle third of the line ,COMMA and then take those two resulting lines and bring them back into the same process ,COMMA a recursive process .PERIOD <BREAK>
these are the places he was drawn to .PERIOD <BREAK>
we get people coming to the foundation all the time .PERIOD <BREAK>
so this is where car-sharing companies such as zipcar and goget come in .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's done ,COMMA it's out ,COMMA you're cured of cancer .PERIOD <BREAK>
and if you could do that ,COMMA then you could find the genes for aging .PERIOD <BREAK>
now i should say ,COMMA before that ,COMMA what i did is i posted a conductor track of myself conducting .PERIOD <BREAK>
you can make the baby poop .PERIOD <BREAK>
we were talking about what happens when you increase the number of sides of a polygon to a very large number .PERIOD <BREAK>
but it's also about producing a language to describe this .PERIOD <BREAK>
of course ,COMMA it doesn’t matter ,COMMA because it could also be that they’re not .PERIOD <BREAK>
el nino comes and goes .PERIOD it's not a disaster ,COMMA it's rhythmic .PERIOD <BREAK>
it means nothing at all .PERIOD <BREAK>
so i'd like to leave you with these thoughts .PERIOD <BREAK>

i've talked to them .PERIOD <BREAK>
but what we found over the past few months is that this approach -- that we're pretty much standard upon -- is incredibly powerful .PERIOD <BREAK>
thank you very much .PERIOD <BREAK>
but what we're trying to create in chicago is a way to get ,COMMA collect together ,COMMA those students who are least represented in our science and technology spheres .PERIOD <BREAK>
we'd be right in assuming that the self is an actual living thing .PERIOD <BREAK>
and then ,COMMA as the other axis kicks in ,COMMA those actually blur into a volume .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's a quite amazing development which has happened .PERIOD <BREAK>
it doesn't matter how wacky they look or how cool they look ,COMMA you cannot copyright the sculptural design .PERIOD <BREAK>

so we're not in a uniquely hospitable place .PERIOD <BREAK>
i would much rather invest in somebody -- you know ,COMMA take a chance on somebody -- who i know is straight than somebody where there's any possible question of ,COMMA you know ,COMMA who are they looking out for ,COMMA and what's going on .PERIOD <BREAK>
and that's kind of their home range .PERIOD <BREAK>
so many ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA that seeing has become a bit of a problem .PERIOD <BREAK>

and ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA to understand it ,COMMA i eventually had to create a whole new kind of science .PERIOD <BREAK>
and in mine ,COMMA i hope .PERIOD <BREAK>
and they saw in the fall that there was this natural ,COMMA beautiful ,COMMA sweet ,COMMA delicious fat from geese .PERIOD <BREAK>

we all move the same way pretty much .PERIOD <BREAK>
we don't have time to go into all of those details ,COMMA but basically ,COMMA that works too .PERIOD <BREAK>

now ,COMMA not all asteroids are that big .PERIOD <BREAK>
he had the rather gloomy conclusion that humans will inevitably despoil any common pool resource in which people cannot be restrained from using it .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's the downside correlation of their fortunes that will become more and more possible .PERIOD <BREAK>

but artistic and decorative skills are actually much older than that .PERIOD <BREAK>
and sometimes it takes a wake-up call ,COMMA doesn't it ,COMMA to alert us to the fact that we're hurrying through our lives ,COMMA instead of actually living them ;SEMICOLON that we're living the fast life ,COMMA instead of the good life .PERIOD <BREAK>
so here is the sloan digital sky survey showing the location of a million galaxies .PERIOD <BREAK>
so it was a little discouraging to the students .PERIOD <BREAK>

they have to try and attract pollinators to do their bidding .PERIOD <BREAK>
india is already at two tons per year .PERIOD <BREAK>

by the time i left ,COMMA we had gone up to almost <NUM> billion dollars .PERIOD and as we speak now ,COMMA we have about <NUM> billion dollars in reserves due to proper management of our finances .PERIOD <BREAK>
now ,COMMA given both the common sense and scientific data calling the doctrine of the blank slate into question ,COMMA why should it have been such an appealing notion ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and what can a cartoonist do ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
so that's the part of the brain that is activated when you give a word to something .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the greatest danger we have of managing this power transition of the shift toward the east is fear .PERIOD <BREAK>
that's an in-joke ,COMMA by the way .PERIOD <BREAK>
in fact ,COMMA most evidence indicates that these nine may behave as three musketeers ,COMMA one for all .PERIOD all for one .PERIOD <BREAK>

who gets to use the mosque on fridays ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
it's a project that has the potential to make a huge impact around the world .PERIOD <BREAK>

it's necessary and ,COMMA just as important ,COMMA it's good for the california economy .PERIOD <BREAK>

attempts to put my poems to music have had disastrous results ,COMMA in all cases .PERIOD <BREAK>
how do we glue those grains of sand together ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>

so much ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA that after you've handled the domestic oil forecast from areas already approved ,COMMA you have only this little bit left ,COMMA and let's see how we can meet that ,COMMA because there's a pretty flexible menu of ways .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA hopefully this will bring back some happy ,COMMA or possibly some slightly disturbing memories .PERIOD <BREAK>
i don't think anybody takes that seriously .PERIOD <BREAK>
it doesn't matter whether the department of defense likes this arm .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the same is more or less what santiago calatrava said when he said ,COMMA light :COLON i make it in my buildings for comfort .PERIOD <BREAK>
the big trials are closer to the true answer .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA it wasn't until the first guy shows up the next day ,COMMA and they ask him ,COMMA where did you get your number from ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>

we're pulling out ,COMMA we're zooming out ,COMMA out through a nuclear pore ,COMMA which is the gateway to this compartment that holds all the dna called the nucleus .PERIOD <BREAK>
lexicography is really more about material science .PERIOD <BREAK>
now if that were true ,COMMA it's a true condemnation of our health care system ,COMMA because they had been seen in other places .PERIOD <BREAK>
i want to give you three dimensions .PERIOD <BREAK>
complete transparency .PERIOD <BREAK>

and merging them together to make the final quantum theory of space and time and gravity ,COMMA is the culmination of that ,COMMA something that’s going on right now .PERIOD <BREAK>
so as we flew by away from it ,COMMA we looked back .PERIOD and guess what ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and what's been taking up the slack in the last few decades ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
today ,COMMA things are a lot more subtle .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so one of the consequences of that ,COMMA i believe ,COMMA is that where we have this sort of spectrum of media right now -- tv ,COMMA film ,COMMA video -- that basically becomes one media platform .PERIOD <BREAK>
if you really want to do it you have to do it .PERIOD <BREAK>
we all hate moral ambiguity in some sense ,COMMA and yet it is also absolutely necessary .PERIOD <BREAK>

i called my mother ,COMMA and she said ,COMMA carmen ,COMMA i need you to come ,COMMA please .PERIOD <BREAK>
because when we think about blogs ,COMMA i think for most of us who are concerned about them ,COMMA we're primarily concerned with things like politics ,COMMA technology ,COMMA etc .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it's through the sharing that people get tactics of how to take care of themselves ,COMMA how to disclose how to take medicines .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i'm glad that we have patrons of the arts in these fields .PERIOD <BREAK>
i can't believe in the doctrines .PERIOD <BREAK>

there are really serious calamities staring us in the eye that we're in the same kind of denial about that we were about terrorism ,COMMA and what could've happened on september <NUM> .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i think that djabran fluctus ,COMMA that fits that mode .PERIOD <BREAK>
now ,COMMA the interesting thing about this is ,COMMA you don't have to be an engineer to appreciate why a <NUM> -foot pole that can fit in your pocket is so interesting .PERIOD <BREAK>

not just for transparency ,COMMA yeah transparency in government is important ,COMMA but that data -- this is the data from all the government departments think about how much of that data is about how life is lived in america .PERIOD <BREAK>

someone made that mistake already so i can't do it anymore .PERIOD <BREAK>
if you're in the jungle ,COMMA it's about <NUM> meters .PERIOD so if a kid bicycles home ,COMMA or walks a few miles ,COMMA they're going to be off the grid ,COMMA so to speak .PERIOD <BREAK>
now this situation ,COMMA already i -- you know ,COMMA i don't really like thinking about this ,COMMA although somehow i got myself a job where i have to think about it .PERIOD so the point is that we're very ,COMMA very insecure in terms of developing this material .PERIOD <BREAK>

so instead of jumping off a plane ,COMMA yes ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
the one thing i think i disagree with about yochai's presentation is when he said the internet causes this distributive capacity for innovation to come alive .PERIOD <BREAK>

the nature of the model depends on the kind of animal we are .PERIOD <BREAK>

the gun may be one of the most important instruments of peace and stability that we have in this world .PERIOD <BREAK>

and i learned that you have to give that in this environment ,COMMA because it's tough .PERIOD <BREAK>
it keeps bothering you a little bit ,COMMA like being hungry .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's just a trace of being in this body .PERIOD <BREAK>
and there was a campaign in australia that involved television and internet and radio commercials to lift the sense of urgency for the people there .PERIOD <BREAK>

this evidence is overwhelming at this point .PERIOD <BREAK>
it is a chess game .PERIOD <BREAK>

a childhood walk ,COMMA which is a project where i ask people to remember a walk that they used to take as a child over and over again that was sort of meaningless -- like on the route to the bus stop ,COMMA to a neighbor's house ,COMMA and take it inside of google streetview .PERIOD <BREAK>

now that is foreplay .PERIOD <BREAK>
and we can then create functional livers .PERIOD <BREAK>
the other big issue is conformity .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's good for improving people's lives .PERIOD <BREAK>
but that's not what i'm going to talk about .PERIOD <BREAK>
singapore .PERIOD you can see ,COMMA they're kind of empty .PERIOD <BREAK>
that means there's no waiting for chemical reactions to take place ,COMMA no need to use reagents that can run out and no need to be an expert to get actionable information .PERIOD <BREAK>

high falls ,COMMA they're old fashioned stunts .PERIOD <BREAK>
i've been trying in america for seven years .PERIOD <BREAK>

we've been able to see every single nerve .PERIOD <BREAK>
because ,COMMA let's face it ,COMMA some patterns are real .PERIOD <BREAK>

or might we be able to leverage today's gaming technology ,COMMA like the microsoft kinect ,COMMA and hack that to enable diagnostics ,COMMA for example ,COMMA in diagnosing stroke ,COMMA using simple motion detection ,COMMA using hundred-dollar devices .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the state ,COMMA of course ,COMMA its authority flows into lots of other areas -- as we are familiar with -- with something like the one-child policy .PERIOD <BREAK>
and we don't invest in what's invisible to us .PERIOD <BREAK>
the first one is harm/care .PERIOD <BREAK>

thirty years have passed since my father's first job as a community game guard .PERIOD <BREAK>
there's a media storyline about wikipedia ,COMMA which i think is false .PERIOD <BREAK>
so as a field biologist ,COMMA you just want to get encounters with these animals .PERIOD <BREAK>
but it's not a bunch of programmers .PERIOD <BREAK>
terrific .PERIOD you learn everything you can about that .PERIOD <BREAK>
so this system that was built for ted is here to illustrate that it is technically possible to actually deploy a system like this ,COMMA and we're looking very hard at how to make it highly cost-effective to use in places like africa and other parts of the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
fabulous ,COMMA colorful ,COMMA anecdotal stories .PERIOD <BREAK>

truth ,COMMA curiosity ,COMMA diversity ,COMMA no selling ,COMMA no corporate bullshit ,COMMA no bandwagoning ,COMMA no platforms .PERIOD <BREAK>
so if you're a software engineer and you're trying to think about whether to add some new functionality to your program ,COMMA it's important to think about how much it costs .PERIOD <BREAK>
and what they basically did was come out with a prioritized list .PERIOD <BREAK>
but still we have a large deficit in dealing with and understanding modern conflict .PERIOD <BREAK>
but if you show them that it's in their interest ,COMMA then they're responsive .PERIOD <BREAK>
we've discovered things like ,COMMA for example ,COMMA rna interference only a few years ago ,COMMA and this is a really fundamental component of how cells work .PERIOD <BREAK>
now you've got to imagine at the moment -- forget this photo ,COMMA imagine this guy with this long ginger beard and this shock of red hair .PERIOD <BREAK>

instead of building a building as big as the football pitch ,COMMA we focused it on this one element .PERIOD <BREAK>
there are little machines doing things in experimental bases .PERIOD <BREAK>
these will be redundant concepts .PERIOD and this isn't only something of the west .PERIOD <BREAK>
we built an application-programming interface ,COMMA which basically means that programmers can write software that interacts with twitter .PERIOD <BREAK>
here go the stem cells ,COMMA right into the beating heart of the patient .PERIOD <BREAK>

fish tried amphibian life .PERIOD frogs adapted to deserts .PERIOD <BREAK>

the way the tv-industrial complex works ,COMMA is you buy some ads -- interrupt some people -- that gets you distribution .PERIOD <BREAK>

and they've gone on to create the revolutions in software and biotechnology and keep the u .PERIOD s .PERIOD at the forefront .PERIOD <BREAK>
ok ?QUESTIONMARK we just sized -- no ,COMMA really ,COMMA i mean that ,COMMA literally .PERIOD <BREAK>
so there are people who are telling us this is going to be reproduced today ,COMMA that what we're going to see is the same thing now in this century .PERIOD <BREAK>

it's fairly dramatic ,COMMA actually ,COMMA to have this happen .PERIOD <BREAK>
it'll survive her .PERIOD <BREAK>
everyone has done something .PERIOD <BREAK>
now why would this kind of fetal learning be useful ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>

and we were grateful that i was able to get pregnant ,COMMA and i soon learned that we were having a boy ,COMMA and then when i was five months ,COMMA we learned that we had lost our child .PERIOD <BREAK>
but since they asked me that question with the word believe in it ,COMMA somehow it was all different ,COMMA because i wasn't exactly sure if i believed what i so clearly felt .PERIOD <BREAK>
i think there's a lot of people in the intelligence community -- a lot of people who deal with this work in general think it's almost inevitable ,COMMA unless we do certain things to really try to defuse the risk ,COMMA like better interdiction ,COMMA better prevention ,COMMA better fixing ,COMMA you know ,COMMA better screening of cargo containers that are coming into the country and so forth .PERIOD <BREAK>

there were about a hundred black folks out there picking .PERIOD <BREAK>

explore this vertical axis ,COMMA that means explore all the different ways to do ,COMMA all the different ways to behave ,COMMA all the different ways to think ,COMMA before we find the one that goes in the direction we wish .PERIOD <BREAK>

wonder is honest ,COMMA it's completely innocent .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so ,COMMA that's a hard way to look at things ,COMMA so i'm just going to encode things as a little barcode ,COMMA grouped by family ,COMMA so you can see the results in a very intuitive way .PERIOD <BREAK>
question one :COLON so does that actually feel the way the flying dream does ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
thank you very much .PERIOD <BREAK>

we want to live in lake wobegon where every child is above average ,COMMA but what this does to our children is really not healthy .PERIOD <BREAK>
start as usual ,COMMA go the other way around the loop .PERIOD <BREAK>

we think in part ,COMMA because of its slow growth and ,COMMA in part ,COMMA cells have all kinds of unique defense mechanisms to keep these events from happening .PERIOD <BREAK>

the video itself is longer ,COMMA but here's a short clip .PERIOD <BREAK>

a bedroom ,COMMA the place where people share intimacy ,COMMA where life itself is conceived ,COMMA became a battlefield .PERIOD <BREAK>

it's because of the second slogan that i want to talk about .PERIOD <BREAK>
day two :COLON we get a very robust rhinovirus pattern ,COMMA and it's very similar to what we get in the lab doing our tissue culture experiment .PERIOD <BREAK>
so it has neither the resources ,COMMA nor the incentives ,COMMA to hook up many other users .PERIOD <BREAK>
you don't see a description of how ,COMMA you know ,COMMA molecule a ,COMMA you know ,COMMA comes up and docks with this other molecule .PERIOD <BREAK>

kenya is now speeding up .PERIOD <BREAK>

well ,COMMA that is precisely what has happened around the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
we'll try and con them into buying it ,COMMA and then .PERIOD <BREAK>

so i'm looking ,COMMA really ,COMMA for a mentor ,COMMA because i just had my birthday .PERIOD <BREAK>
they are visual ,COMMA auditory ,COMMA reading and writing and kinesthetic .PERIOD <BREAK>
so instead of trying to make a car that can fly ,COMMA we decided to try to make a plane that could drive .PERIOD <BREAK>
when you write the best-selling book in the world ,COMMA it's tons and tons of money -- and it brought in a lot of attention ,COMMA neither of which i wanted .PERIOD <BREAK>

and this engine is not just economic value ;SEMICOLON it is pulling material resources relentlessly through the system ,COMMA driven by our own insatiable appetites ,COMMA driven in fact by a sense of anxiety .PERIOD <BREAK>

the sleepy giant ,COMMA which is the song that i just sang ,COMMA is one of his poems .PERIOD <BREAK>
but this technology could not find tumors when they're small ,COMMA and finding a small tumor is critical for survival .PERIOD <BREAK>
and this is -- at least ,COMMA to a traditional economist -- somewhat remarkable ,COMMA because the traditional account of economic man would say that ,COMMA basically ,COMMA you do things for a concrete reward ,COMMA primarily financial .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA this is some of my work on how do you do an autonomously self-replicating system .PERIOD <BREAK>
i mean ,COMMA it just -- it just -- untangled a thing that was really impeding technology from being developed .PERIOD <BREAK>
the indians don't even understand why we think of it as a problem because most people in india fill two or three gallons every time .PERIOD <BREAK>

people just go because it's pleasurable to be there .PERIOD <BREAK>
ok ,COMMA this is mount everest .PERIOD <BREAK>
instead ,COMMA these people drink a little bit every day ,COMMA not a hard sell to the american population .PERIOD <BREAK>
