so all of this money started pouring in ,COMMA and all of this fame started pouring in ,COMMA and i go ,COMMA what do i do with this ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>

i think that's one of the main changes ,COMMA also ,COMMA in architecture :COLON that we're starting to look now not for some ideal form ,COMMA like a latin cross for a church ,COMMA but actually all the traits of a church :COLON so ,COMMA light that comes from behind from an invisible source ,COMMA directionality that focuses you towards an altar .PERIOD <BREAK>

and we'll wind in the target .PERIOD <BREAK>
and we set ourselves a goal of turning the continent green .PERIOD <BREAK>
on the other end of the spectrum ,COMMA we have a dionysian perspective ,COMMA which is more given to the passions and intuition ,COMMA tolerant of organic texture and human gesture .PERIOD <BREAK>
so the next one .PERIOD now ,COMMA this is the kid ,COMMA same crash ,COMMA who is in the seatbelt .PERIOD he hardly moves at all ,COMMA actually ,COMMA relative to the other child .PERIOD the funny thing is ,COMMA the cam work is terrible because they've only set it up to do the car seats ,COMMA and so ,COMMA they actually don't even have a way to move the camera so you can see the kid that's on the rebound .PERIOD <BREAK>
because nato couldn't be <NUM> % sure that the kremlin was indeed behind these attacks .PERIOD <BREAK>
the only issue with oscar pistorius is he was born without bones in the lower part of his legs .PERIOD <BREAK>

the rca is really quite an amazing school from that viewpoint .PERIOD <BREAK>
jane goodall :COLON two ,COMMA two ,COMMA i'm going to take two .PERIOD <BREAK>

i think we should do all things ,COMMA but we don't .PERIOD <BREAK>

and they are collected en mass -- you can see the scale of it here -- and sorted out ,COMMA by hand ,COMMA back into the right sizes ,COMMA and then put back out on the street .PERIOD <BREAK>
now let's see it in action .PERIOD <BREAK>
and there's a little clock in the lower left-hand corner ,COMMA so you can see the animal is about two minutes into this .PERIOD <BREAK>
there are also these smaller cells as you'll see .PERIOD <BREAK>
instead there is one word that imbues your entire life ,COMMA and that word is ikigai .PERIOD <BREAK>
but ,COMMA you know ,COMMA as i looked at this more and more and more ,COMMA and saw these images go across the rocks ,COMMA i realized i was seeing the same archetypal events depicted again and again and again .PERIOD <BREAK>
you see the person live .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA you've got to go after the space down there .PERIOD <BREAK>
that people on the fringes can find each other ,COMMA connect and go somewhere .PERIOD <BREAK>
what this company does is they send a letter to households that say ,COMMA here's your energy use ,COMMA here's your neighbor's energy use :COLON you're doing well .PERIOD smiley face .PERIOD <BREAK>

as you can see ,COMMA sometimes a subspecies branches off .PERIOD <BREAK>

and then they tail off ,COMMA there's a few ,COMMA but that's it .PERIOD <BREAK>
real-world problems are often ambiguous and ill-defined and the context is always changing .PERIOD <BREAK>
that scene sounds like science fiction ,COMMA but is battlefield reality already .PERIOD <BREAK>
women's longer lifespan ?QUESTIONMARK the fact that women tend to be much less violent than men ?QUESTIONMARK but ,COMMA no ,COMMA it wasn't any of these gifts .PERIOD <BREAK>

they don't feel as if they're doing something that really matters to them ,COMMA so they pick up these kinds of activities .PERIOD <BREAK>

two millennia ago ,COMMA those greeks had some powerful insights .PERIOD <BREAK>
and that's desperately what we need again on a global scale .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i'm coloring these small windows blue if another virus shares an identical sequence in its genome to that virus .PERIOD <BREAK>

it would be ,COMMA as ed felton once famously said ,COMMA like handing out water that wasn't wet .PERIOD <BREAK>
and they've made this ,COMMA what was just a store along a commercial strip ,COMMA into a community gathering space .PERIOD <BREAK>
and they really preferred that the money would be used for higher salaries ,COMMA more schools ,COMMA whatever .PERIOD <BREAK>
so that today ,COMMA the people living outside africa have about two and a half percent of their dna from neanderthals .PERIOD <BREAK>
can you say it with me ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
moreover ,COMMA americans themselves could benefit from incorporating new perspectives into their own narrative ,COMMA which has been driving their choices for so long .PERIOD <BREAK>
it is about action .PERIOD <BREAK>
i pulled out those apples to remind myself to tell you that this is actually probably a newton and the apple type story ,COMMA but it's a great story .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's not his money ,COMMA of course .PERIOD <BREAK>
if apple were like everyone else ,COMMA a marketing message from them might sound like this :COLON we make great computers .PERIOD <BREAK>
the exact converse is also true .PERIOD <BREAK>
you know it's a little bit like a birth .PERIOD <BREAK>
thanks rom .PERIOD thank you .PERIOD <BREAK>
there are very ,COMMA very few people who don't know now about what is happening in the arctic .PERIOD <BREAK>
now ,COMMA some of these same social investors are really interested in africa and understand the importance of agriculture ,COMMA and they even helped the farmers .PERIOD <BREAK>
i'll use these sidewalks in rio as an example .PERIOD <BREAK>
they're going to make their own decisions about who to shoot and who not to shoot without a human in the loop .PERIOD <BREAK>
i see beauty in the future of the internet ,COMMA but i'm worried that we might not see that .PERIOD <BREAK>
right now we may think of a big ,COMMA rich country like the u .PERIOD s .PERIOD doing this .PERIOD <BREAK>
we would not know which way we were going ,COMMA and why we are going where we're going .PERIOD <BREAK>
witness the fact that americans are holding on to their cars longer than ever before ,COMMA <NUM> .PERIOD <NUM> years on average ,COMMA in march .PERIOD a record .PERIOD <BREAK>

this is the notion of loss aversion .PERIOD <BREAK>

yet i believe the price we pay is well worth holding on to our dignity and making the world a fairer place .PERIOD <BREAK>
and you know ,COMMA boyle says ,COMMA well ,COMMA shit .PERIOD <BREAK>
people will come in to those places where you've got contaminated drinking water ,COMMA bring things back to the family ,COMMA may drink right at that point .PERIOD <BREAK>

and politics is ,COMMA in the ideal sense ,COMMA the way in which we continually address our network of relations in order to achieve a better life and a better society .PERIOD <BREAK>
but whoever it is ,COMMA i can't help but thinking they woke up one day like ,COMMA oh my god ,COMMA that wasn't there last night .PERIOD ooooohh !EXCLAMATIONMARK <BREAK>
but i rather play something completely unheard of ,COMMA and even with flaws ,COMMA than repeat the same thing over and over which has been hollowed by its meaninglessness .PERIOD <BREAK>
i was <NUM> years in the corporate world ,COMMA trying to make organizations profitable .PERIOD <BREAK>
and even though the workday is typically eight hours ,COMMA how many people here have ever had eight hours to themselves at the office ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
we're going to have to live closer to each other .PERIOD <BREAK>
other headlines that have recently reached south africa were bain capital and kkr ,COMMA the big boys of private equity .PERIOD <BREAK>

the research that my laboratory has been doing ,COMMA that economists and psychologists around the country have been doing ,COMMA have revealed something really quite startling to us ,COMMA something we call the impact bias ,COMMA which is the tendency for the simulator to work badly .PERIOD <BREAK>
but we at harvard were wondering if this was really true .PERIOD <BREAK>
and when my professors saw this ,COMMA they were very upset at me .PERIOD <BREAK>
well ,COMMA you are to ride a bicycle ,COMMA carrying your own weight and also some other weight ,COMMA so that you can earn the bread for the day .PERIOD <BREAK>
but i suspected there was something really important about this whole feminism thing ,COMMA so i started covertly tiptoeing into my mom's bookshelves and picking books off and reading them -- never ,COMMA of course ,COMMA admitting that i was doing so .PERIOD <BREAK>
but actually ,COMMA with this theory ,COMMA we find that the forces of nature do seem to unify together ,COMMA back at the big bang -- absolutely beautiful prophecy .PERIOD the model wasn't built to do that ,COMMA but it seems to do it .PERIOD <BREAK>
the other was treating the patients with quinine ,COMMA or quinine derivatives .PERIOD <BREAK>
in just five years ,COMMA their ratio went from one worker for every <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> people to one worker for every <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> people .PERIOD <BREAK>

i created a little oil spill in the gulf of mexico .PERIOD <BREAK>
in the measure that you have the source code ,COMMA as all of you know ,COMMA you can change the source code ,COMMA and you can reprogram life forms so that this little thingy becomes a vaccine ,COMMA or this little thingy starts producing biomaterials ,COMMA which is why dupont is now growing a form of polyester that feels like silk in corn .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is the main method that i use .PERIOD this is called functional mri .PERIOD <BREAK>
how many trees does it have ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
so here is the thinking different bit .PERIOD <BREAK>
in the world of food we call it cooking .PERIOD <BREAK>
but what gave us hope were these incredibly dedicated and brave volunteers -- three of whom here are force-feeding penguins .PERIOD <BREAK>
i would say that the future of life and the dignity of human beings depends on our doing that .PERIOD <BREAK>
there's a huge amount of information about the genetics just by comparing the genetic similarity .PERIOD <BREAK>
it was deep in my imagination .PERIOD <BREAK>
when you stack people in rows ,COMMA the ones in the background look smaller than the ones in the foreground -- but not in the world of glamour .PERIOD <BREAK>
they don't get any information ,COMMA they don't get any value for what they spend .PERIOD <BREAK>
but that may not be all that's going on .PERIOD <BREAK>
i've often wondered ,COMMA what is the evolutionary pressure that made our ancestors in the veldt adapt and evolve to really enjoy pictures of galaxies when they didn't have any .PERIOD <BREAK>
i was <NUM> lbs .PERIOD <BREAK>
right .PERIOD so if the eyes are shining ,COMMA you know you're doing it .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the question is :COLON what underlies this transformation ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
i've looked to see what is the relationship between higher commodity prices of exports ,COMMA and the growth of commodity-exporting countries .PERIOD <BREAK>
but what about walking from hole to hole ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and now ,COMMA you've got to wrap it up and tie it up here .PERIOD <BREAK>
here are two texts that contain some symbols on them .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's about <NUM> million a day ,COMMA which is the equivalent of about two and a half million books a year .PERIOD <BREAK>

now ,COMMA in essence ,COMMA the king was asking us to consider an alternative definition of success ,COMMA what has come to be known as gnh ,COMMA or gross national happiness .PERIOD <BREAK>
i'm so used to that .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's a waterborne disease ,COMMA not something that's in the air .PERIOD <BREAK>
this takes the water out of the restaurant ,COMMA runs it through these stone beds -- this is going to be mint in there -- and i sort of water the garden with it .PERIOD <BREAK>
people like josh and steve are continuing to layer information upon information ,COMMA real-time information ,COMMA tweet it and text it onto these maps for all to use .PERIOD <BREAK>
so when you look around the world and you see that ,COMMA in many cases -- certainly in the western world -- women are evolving into more leadership positions ,COMMA and even other places some barriers are being brought down ,COMMA but there's still so much violence ,COMMA still so many problems ,COMMA and yet we hear there are more women at the negotiating tables .PERIOD <BREAK>
but now if you have an option that nobody wants ,COMMA you can take it off .PERIOD right ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and then we pasted everywhere -- the whole hill .PERIOD <BREAK>
and he'd be showing you these amazing statistics ,COMMA these amazing animations .PERIOD <BREAK>
audience :COLON wow .PERIOD <BREAK>
so that begs the next question .PERIOD <BREAK>
and we're helping ,COMMA working with them to create a new building .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it was really a turning point in my life ,COMMA where i started to realize that i couldn't just go have fun doing science and exploration .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i want to argue that what we do is we try to change everything .PERIOD <BREAK>
so there's this collective decision-making that's going on .PERIOD <BREAK>
audience :COLON yeah .PERIOD <BREAK>
but on the other hand ,COMMA we have <NUM> billion of these :COLON light bulbs ,COMMA light .PERIOD <BREAK>
language seems to be really important here .PERIOD <BREAK>
there are about a hundred billion stars in the milky way galaxy .PERIOD <BREAK>
so you must have patience .PERIOD <BREAK>
we counted around <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> ,COMMA so i don't know how many penguins there really are ,COMMA but i know i can count <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> .PERIOD <BREAK>
so it wasn't a big seller .PERIOD <BREAK>
let me just rush very quickly through things that we've done .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is yadira ,COMMA and yadira is five years old .PERIOD she's in a tribe that's neighboring the huaorani .PERIOD <BREAK>
so the first one is -- these are the bursty words around <NUM> s -- slaves ,COMMA emancipation ,COMMA slavery ,COMMA rebellion ,COMMA kansas .PERIOD <BREAK>
they're the things that you'd snatch if the house was on fire .PERIOD <BREAK>
and in there he said that cultures tend to swing between one of two perspectives .PERIOD <BREAK>
thank you .PERIOD <BREAK>
and this forest is quite different .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's one in which we can all gain .PERIOD <BREAK>
it damaged the gene .PERIOD <BREAK>
zero became a person and not just a character in a play .PERIOD <BREAK>
it was like ,COMMA you know ,COMMA she was there in the class ,COMMA you know ,COMMA she was kind of typically french .PERIOD <BREAK>
engineers like to look at systems like this .PERIOD scientists like to look at systems like this .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it's an amazing thing to think that this close to miami ,COMMA two hours from miami ,COMMA there is an entire civilization of people praying every day for your well-being .PERIOD <BREAK>
so this one would have to be bigger ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
that's intentional .PERIOD <BREAK>
i also learned that some of our tastiest mushrooms can clean environmental toxins in soil .PERIOD <BREAK>
you can see it doesn't make sense to make an average of this zero improvement and this very fast improvement .PERIOD <BREAK>
that you see ,COMMA the horizontal axis is where you place your country .PERIOD <BREAK>
well ,COMMA mdg <NUM> .PERIOD <BREAK>
i like this slide ,COMMA because it’s a chance to talk about what really motivates people to change ,COMMA and what doesn’t .PERIOD <BREAK>
those of you who grew up in india ,COMMA do you remember in your childhood ,COMMA dragonflies ,COMMA swarms of dragonflies ?QUESTIONMARK maybe at school ,COMMA maybe tying little bits of string onto them ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>

i wrote a book about eight incredible people all over this country doing social justice work .PERIOD <BREAK>

you know ,COMMA it's not easy to get into these caves .PERIOD <BREAK>
one of the guys i hired was an engineer named jack dorsey ,COMMA and a year later we were trying to decide which way to go with odeo ,COMMA and jack presented an idea he'd been tinkering around with for a number of years that was based around sending simple status updates to friends .PERIOD <BREAK>
to start simply ,COMMA i want to say that compassion is kind .PERIOD <BREAK>
that brings up questions of privacy and insurability and all kinds of stuff ,COMMA but it also allows us to start going after diseases ,COMMA because if you run a person who has leukemia through something like this ,COMMA it turns out that three diseases with completely similar clinical syndromes are completely different diseases .PERIOD <BREAK>
and someone sits down and draws a picture .PERIOD <BREAK>
in the midst of the wreckage at ground zero ,COMMA i had a realization .PERIOD <BREAK>
however ,COMMA that is simply not enough .PERIOD <BREAK>
can you take this biosphere ,COMMA that has evolved on a planetary scale ,COMMA and jam it into a little bottle ,COMMA and will it survive ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
so what is the biggest challenge working ,COMMA mother and daughter ,COMMA in such dangerous and sometimes scary situations ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and we continued .PERIOD <BREAK>

now a lot of you are probably familiar with deb roy who ,COMMA back in march ,COMMA demonstrated how he was able to analyze more than <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> hours of home video .PERIOD <BREAK>
and all the people -- and i think there's a lot of people at ted who do things because -- even though there's not an immediate return on the investment because it will only really pay off when everybody else has done it -- they'll do it because they're the sort of person who just does things which would be good if everybody else did them .PERIOD <BREAK>
i tried a really hard one then .PERIOD <BREAK>
most people fled abroad .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the main thing that i would really ask all of you as you go back to your countries ,COMMA or as you stay here :COLON ask your government for an integrated food policy .PERIOD <BREAK>
and in the name of connectedness ,COMMA the only thing she wanted before she died was to be brought home by her beloved gulf of mexico .PERIOD <BREAK>
then ,COMMA the question becomes not growth or no growth ,COMMA but what do you want to grow ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
this is a measurement we obtained a few years ago from a mars-orbiting satellite called odyssey .PERIOD <BREAK>
but we can look at how well we're doing by thinking about how well we're doing building machines which can do what humans can do .PERIOD <BREAK>
i spent the best part of last year working on a documentary about my own happiness -- trying to see if i can actually train my mind in a particular way ,COMMA like i can train my body ,COMMA so i can end up with an improved feeling of overall well-being .PERIOD <BREAK>
armstrong explained the brutal reality of their situation :COLON they paid <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> shillings in rent ,COMMA about <NUM> bucks a month ,COMMA a relatively high price for a kenyan shantytown ,COMMA and they could not afford to be late with the money .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it was deng xiaoping coming out here .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA all the ideas about how to transform through design -- old quarries and open universities and botanic garden -- all of it's related to how we teach the children .PERIOD <BREAK>
well how about with higher levels of amputation ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and it's the poor people who are affected worse .PERIOD <BREAK>
oh ,COMMA they also say they will sell you astrology or other fortunetelling methods .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA in computer graphics and computer user interface design ,COMMA there is a term called affordances .PERIOD <BREAK>
and each one of these stars represents a population where scientists have asked ,COMMA okay ,COMMA are there differences in the type of foxo genes among people who live a really long time ?QUESTIONMARK and there are .PERIOD <BREAK>

and i'm going to show you two videos that have gotten a lot of attention recently that i think embody this philosophy .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the answer is ,COMMA of course ,COMMA yes .PERIOD <BREAK>
and we went down ,COMMA investigated .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so i started that swim in a bathing suit like normal ,COMMA and ,COMMA no joke ,COMMA this is it ;SEMICOLON it came from the shark divers .PERIOD <BREAK>
and you have to realize that these incidents did not happen in convenient locations .PERIOD <BREAK>
i would say ,COMMA no ,COMMA that's an elephant .PERIOD <BREAK>
first of all ,COMMA when you go to bed at night ,COMMA you've got to look back on the day and make sure that you felt the day was a day which you contributed something ,COMMA and that you did everything you could to do it the best way you could .PERIOD <BREAK>
i bought that last year .PERIOD they're very difficult to find .PERIOD <BREAK>
and actually ,COMMA let me go back to that slide ,COMMA because when we launched it in <NUM> -- this idea to create the first ever day of ceasefire and non-violence -- we invited thousands of people .PERIOD <BREAK>

he's taught them to spell his name ,COMMA which is aldo .PERIOD <BREAK>
the pressure here is <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> pounds per square inch .PERIOD <BREAK>
we have oxytocin that connects us to others ,COMMA makes us feel what they feel .PERIOD <BREAK>
and ultimately we can control the branching to mimic what we think the continents were like ,COMMA and run it a thousand times ,COMMA so we can estimate the parameters ,COMMA to answer the question whether we are on the mark or not ,COMMA at least to know the barriers of the problems .PERIOD so that's a little bit about the science .PERIOD <BREAK>
one third of it ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA is genetic .PERIOD <BREAK>
every world has an alien ,COMMA and every alien world has a flying saucer ,COMMA and they move about with great speed .PERIOD aliens .PERIOD <BREAK>
thank you very much .PERIOD <BREAK>
so i actually threw a pop quiz here onto rufus .PERIOD <BREAK>
but other than that ,COMMA the two hemispheres are completely separate .PERIOD <BREAK>
very sustainable in this environment .PERIOD <BREAK>
you get up ,COMMA it flushes by itself .PERIOD <BREAK>
now i have a saying that i feel very strongly about ,COMMA because i am of a certain age where ,COMMA when i started in my career ,COMMA believe it or not ,COMMA there were other women who criticized me :COLON why aren't you in the carpool line ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
i think our ancestors -- i think human beings have been wondering about this question since they sat around their campfires or lay and watched the stars a million years ago .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i started looking at how we could build battery back-up systems that could give people five hours ,COMMA <NUM> hours ,COMMA maybe even a full day ,COMMA or three days' worth of back-up power .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i learned that one person can make a huge difference .PERIOD <BREAK>
but there is something that can give the self ultimate and infinite connection -- and that thing is oneness ,COMMA our essence .PERIOD <BREAK>
i think this is a reasonable sequence of events that happened in the progression of the technology of powered flight .PERIOD <BREAK>
do not win an oscar for best actress .PERIOD <BREAK>
so we actually sort of designed the entire island as a single ecosystem ,COMMA exploiting wind energy to drive the desalination plants ,COMMA and to use the thermal properties of water to heat and cool the buildings .PERIOD <BREAK>
they do have a very rich repertoire of postures and gestures ,COMMA many of which are similar ,COMMA or even identical ,COMMA to ours and formed in the same context .PERIOD greeting chimpanzees embracing .PERIOD <BREAK>
i'm doing <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> meals a day and i've been doing it for two years ,COMMA trying to change how we feed kids in america .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's every seven days .PERIOD <BREAK>
they were key in our culture and our economy .PERIOD <BREAK>
you know ,COMMA you can tell -- and i think when we're getting into collective play ,COMMA its really important for groups to gain a sense of safety through their own sharing of play signals .PERIOD <BREAK>
and anybody who wants to do science is -- this is about the time that isaac newton was starting to whip out a lot of really interesting things .PERIOD <BREAK>
there's been many other seminars and university students ,COMMA and different things .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's fairly interesting .PERIOD <BREAK>
that's what the spider has to interact with their environment .PERIOD <BREAK>
so we didn't do it .PERIOD <BREAK>
it has to stand up to the heat and the wear and tear that happens in hospitals in these rural districts .PERIOD <BREAK>
you overcompensate .PERIOD <BREAK>
the two blobs that are light in the middle there are the united states and europe .PERIOD <BREAK>
we're very good at creating personal narratives ,COMMA but it's the shared narratives that make us a culture .PERIOD <BREAK>
in the <NUM> s ,COMMA olds and milner put electrodes into the brain of a rat .PERIOD <BREAK>
i started a group called open source ecology .PERIOD <BREAK>
and we get about two or three bands a day signing up .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i knew that there had to be a way to prevent this .PERIOD <BREAK>
well ,COMMA dr .PERIOD king wasn't the only man in america who was a great orator .PERIOD <BREAK>
so we did a simple analysis ,COMMA and it doesn't take rocket science to figure out that ,COMMA if you take <NUM> percent every year ,COMMA your fishery is going to collapse very quickly .PERIOD <BREAK>
and they are taking over sweden ,COMMA and they are now healthier than sweden .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it describes the same effortless ,COMMA spontaneous feeling that you get when you enter into this ecstatic state .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA the problem is that the clinical trial was done ,COMMA and we were a part of it ,COMMA and in the fundamental clinical trial -- the pivotal clinical trial we call the phase three ,COMMA we refused to use a placebo .PERIOD <BREAK>
they had all suffered the same tragedy .PERIOD <BREAK>
however ,COMMA they return to baseline a lot sooner .PERIOD <BREAK>
preserving the genome of these fungi in the old-growth forest i think is absolutely critical for human health .PERIOD <BREAK>
jennifer :COLON a soldier walked onto the road ,COMMA asking where we'd been .PERIOD <BREAK>
w <NUM> :COLON they suck .PERIOD <BREAK>
i know what you're thinking :COLON other juggling teams must really suck .PERIOD <BREAK>
that was a very moving piece .PERIOD <BREAK>
they're both exactly the same size and shape to an uncanny degree .PERIOD <BREAK>
i also like rock and roll .PERIOD <BREAK>
what do they tell us ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
somehow i ended up at the hospital .PERIOD <BREAK>
and then you're out on the street ,COMMA and you don't know where to go .PERIOD <BREAK>
i've got two kids .PERIOD he's <NUM> now ;SEMICOLON my daughter's <NUM> .PERIOD <BREAK>
we're missing california from american english .PERIOD <BREAK>

the graph'g-beam turn on .PERIOD this next slide ,COMMA that's the -- as far as i know -- the first digital bitmap display ,COMMA <NUM> .PERIOD <BREAK>
so then -- pshoo-shoo -- lightning -- pshoo -- arrive -- pshoo-shoo -- makes life -- bloop bloop -- and that dies .PERIOD <BREAK>
i'm going to take you quickly through the actual process of doing a poster .PERIOD <BREAK>
well ,COMMA the history of physics would have us believe that the rule for the universe must be pretty complicated .PERIOD <BREAK>
so i'm not going to go on until every single person in this room ,COMMA downstairs and in aspen ,COMMA and everybody else looking ,COMMA will come to love and understand classical music .PERIOD <BREAK>
they are able to respond to gravity ,COMMA of course ,COMMA so the shoots are growing against the vector of gravity and the roots toward the vector of gravity .PERIOD <BREAK>
there are epiphytes ,COMMA plants that grow on trees .PERIOD <BREAK>
i came up with this .PERIOD this is railroad rush hour .PERIOD <BREAK>
and as a teacher of yoga ,COMMA he brings that experience to others across the spectrum of ability and disability ,COMMA health ,COMMA illness and aging .PERIOD <BREAK>
there are some places you can't look because of our own galaxy ,COMMA or because there are no telescopes available to do it .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is interesting because this sleeping machinery ,COMMA it's perfectly conserved .PERIOD <BREAK>
shame ,COMMA for women ,COMMA is this web of unobtainable ,COMMA conflicting ,COMMA competing expectations about who we're supposed to be .PERIOD <BREAK>
now there is another kind of mirror neuron ,COMMA which is involved in something quite different .PERIOD <BREAK>
and for many of us ,COMMA our fortunes do indeed lie at the bottom of the pyramid .PERIOD thank you .PERIOD <BREAK>
they have it running through mazes ,COMMA controlling where it's going .PERIOD <BREAK>
what happens is ,COMMA they burn into flash memory the software ,COMMA and then test them for a few hours .PERIOD <BREAK>
and let me recap some of the stuff you've seen .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i think this is actually a shrimp that's releasing its bioluminescent chemicals into the water .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it leads to just a completely different value system .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA we have our ganges and yamuna cleanup project .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is called gravity .PERIOD <BREAK>
but anyone who's ever had ,COMMA or knows ,COMMA small children knows they're incredibly complex organisms .PERIOD <BREAK>
extreme sports on top level like this is only possible if you practice step by step ,COMMA if you really work hard on your skills and on your knowledge .PERIOD <BREAK>
he was simple the instrument of god's will .PERIOD <BREAK>
i was missing school .PERIOD it was pretty much miserable .PERIOD <BREAK>
when you do that ,COMMA you're forced to feel what they feel .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the teacher said ,COMMA but nobody knows what god looks like .PERIOD <BREAK>
and though that company has just started ,COMMA our assumption is that there too we'll see the impact on millions .PERIOD <BREAK>
and ghana was not paying enough attention .PERIOD <BREAK>
these are also called mesh networks .PERIOD <BREAK>
and let me repeat what you saw last year .PERIOD <BREAK>
but that hospital was over four hours away ,COMMA and sevitha didn't have the means to get there ,COMMA so her baby died .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so i think it's time we change what we expect from our food .PERIOD <BREAK>
you see ,COMMA at the more unequal end ,COMMA it's about <NUM> percent of the population who feel they can trust others .PERIOD <BREAK>
i found out that they had a very hard time dealing with frustration and difficulties -- not because they were physically unfit .PERIOD <BREAK>
i made a desktop publishing system way back when ,COMMA and that was ,COMMA kind of ,COMMA my first step into figuring out how to -- oh ,COMMA these two sides are kind of fun to mix .PERIOD <BREAK>
well ,COMMA you sir ,COMMA you've got those glasses hung around your neck in that particularly fetching way .PERIOD <BREAK>
there were four of us -- two bedouin drivers -- and you can just imagine ,COMMA this expanse is an ocean of sand ,COMMA <NUM> degrees ,COMMA one water bottle .PERIOD <BREAK>
so it's not about my story .PERIOD it's not about your story .PERIOD <BREAK>
do you invest the time with your loved ones that you could do ,COMMA and energy ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and so ,COMMA when i told her about our idea -- that maybe we could take a tupperware model from the united states ,COMMA and find a way for the women themselves to go out and sell these nets to others -- she quickly started calculating what she herself could make and signed up .PERIOD <BREAK>
the buick's parked outside ,COMMA and she's jingling ,COMMA jangling a pair of keys .PERIOD <BREAK>
and if the numbers coming in from china are anything like what they look like now ,COMMA it's not going to be <NUM> years .PERIOD <BREAK>

<NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> different languages spoken by six and a half billion people ,COMMA all different colors ,COMMA shapes ,COMMA sizes .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is a new generation ,COMMA a new family ,COMMA which is able to store the winds .PERIOD <BREAK>
the elements that make up the ceiling grid and the lighting ,COMMA they're all losing their modular quality ,COMMA and moving more and more to these infinitesimal dimensions .PERIOD <BREAK>
and then we've got a four kilowatt-hour cell on the horizon .PERIOD <BREAK>
you can go to the youtube and find india innovates and then you will find these videos .PERIOD <BREAK>
we are still cartesians -- the children of descartes -- who believe that subjectivity ,COMMA consciousness ,COMMA sets us apart ;SEMICOLON that the world is divided into subjects and objects ;SEMICOLON that there is nature on one side ,COMMA culture on another .PERIOD <BREAK>
have a good day .PERIOD thank you .PERIOD <BREAK>
where did you do it ?QUESTIONMARK in his car .PERIOD <BREAK>
i can rely on that vast history of mathematicians and artists looking at disc packings and arrangements .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so they bring in this big ,COMMA clunky analog tape recorder and they start recording these little bleep ,COMMA bleeps .PERIOD <BREAK>
here you're going to see no false emotion ,COMMA just the authentic expression of a mother's agony .PERIOD <BREAK>
thanks .PERIOD <BREAK>
what i'm looking for is a way to give the material the qualities that i need .PERIOD <BREAK>
if you look at the word salvation in the bible -- the christian usage that we're familiar with -- saving souls ,COMMA that people go to heaven -- that's actually a latecomer .PERIOD <BREAK>
so i'd like you to meet john .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's also objectionable on a second ground .PERIOD <BREAK>
so i'm going to talk a little bit about that ,COMMA and what exactly is it that scientists are supposed to do .PERIOD <BREAK>
and since my husband is in istanbul ,COMMA i started commuting between arizona and istanbul -- the two places on the surface of earth that couldn't be more different .PERIOD <BREAK>
we find that premise quite exciting .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is actually a limb injury in this salamander .PERIOD <BREAK>
you need to have incentives .PERIOD <BREAK>
so we often talk about stealth as a means for avoiding any type of sensing ,COMMA but when things looks just natural ,COMMA you also don't see them .PERIOD <BREAK>
they aren't an improvement ,COMMA but they're the best i can do .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is the view over times square ,COMMA with the beaver pond there ,COMMA looking out toward the east .PERIOD <BREAK>
thank you very much .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's about enjoying mundane sounds .PERIOD <BREAK>
anyone who's followed politics can testify to how hard that is for some people to get .PERIOD <BREAK>
the formations can change .PERIOD <BREAK>
can you do it ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
so my provocative statement is that we desperately need a serious scientific theory of cities .PERIOD <BREAK>
and you see that patient now six months after with an x-ray showing you the regenerated tissue ,COMMA which is fully regenerated when you analyze it under the microscope .PERIOD <BREAK>
i can't think of anything else that's happened in my lifetime that way .PERIOD <BREAK>
it turned out to be absolutely instrumental many decades later in proving fermat's last theorem .PERIOD <BREAK>
and they say ,COMMA oh ,COMMA yeah .PERIOD constant acceleration .PERIOD <BREAK>
yeah ,COMMA i've been worrying about that too .PERIOD <BREAK>
sit them in a classroom ,COMMA tell them about plato at the age of <NUM> ,COMMA send them out for a career in management consultancy for <NUM> years ,COMMA and that lesson will stick with them .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA the question is how do you go from the mud-hut village ,COMMA to the more developed city ,COMMA to the even highly developed sultanbelyi ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
the patients ,COMMA bless them ,COMMA say ,COMMA ah ,COMMA doc ,COMMA i'm sorry ,COMMA i've got a memory problem ;SEMICOLON that's why i'm here .PERIOD <BREAK>
again ,COMMA the eyes and hands of avalokiteshvara .PERIOD <BREAK>
so every <NUM> years we do germination tests on every sample of seeds that we have .PERIOD <BREAK>
the testicles emerge -- they look like thumbs ,COMMA coming right at you -- and he says ,COMMA bite 'em .PERIOD <BREAK>
on the outside it looks like a typical northeastern garage .PERIOD <BREAK>
now over and over again ,COMMA people have said ,COMMA let's build bridges ,COMMA and frankly ,COMMA i want to do more than that .PERIOD <BREAK>
men ,COMMA if you get nothing else out of this talk ,COMMA practice expansive listening ,COMMA and you can transform your relationships .PERIOD <BREAK>
the next time you see somebody driving a ferrari don't think ,COMMA this is somebody who is greedy .PERIOD <BREAK>
we take an idea ,COMMA combine it with a square ,COMMA and you get an origami figure .PERIOD <BREAK>
how did we become the only species that becomes more prosperous as it becomes more populous ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
is that a responsible thing to do ?QUESTIONMARK etc .PERIOD etc .PERIOD <BREAK>
no ,COMMA not everything fits so tidily into the paradigm ,COMMA but that does not mean there's not something going on at the highest possible levels .PERIOD <BREAK>
existential risk -- the second big problem .PERIOD <BREAK>
like ,COMMA for example ,COMMA a hive of bees that's finding a new nesting site ,COMMA or a flock of birds that's evading a predator ,COMMA or a flock of birds that's able to pool its wisdom and navigate and find a tiny speck of an island in the middle of the pacific ,COMMA or a pack of wolves that's able to bring down larger prey .PERIOD <BREAK>
and everybody says it's because i have a little museum .PERIOD <BREAK>
later he renamed it the stethoscope .PERIOD <BREAK>
the art pieces are about the ideas and how they present them and do them ,COMMA but the actual things have to be verifiable .PERIOD <BREAK>
that little hole in the middle there is for the pollen tube ,COMMA and when the pollen finds its special female spot in another morina flower ,COMMA just on the right species ,COMMA what happens ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
they had created an industrial ecosystem ,COMMA of a sense .PERIOD <BREAK>
what was ,COMMA for me ,COMMA a very naive observation ,COMMA turned out to be a disaster .PERIOD <BREAK>
and in theory ,COMMA that means that ,COMMA as a mouse feels ,COMMA smells ,COMMA hears ,COMMA touches ,COMMA you can model it out as a string of ones and zeros .PERIOD <BREAK>
indeed ,COMMA one of the advantages that the americans will have in terms of power in asia is all those countries want an american insurance policy against the rise of china .PERIOD <BREAK>
and they would just kind of throw the buckets down there and hope that it would somehow go away ,COMMA and of course it never really would go away .PERIOD <BREAK>
and simply put ,COMMA if penguins are dying ,COMMA it means our oceans are dying ,COMMA and we ultimately will be affected ,COMMA because ,COMMA as sylvia earle says ,COMMA the oceans are our life-support system .PERIOD <BREAK>
so what you are seeing here are the layers on the wall of that crater ,COMMA and the rover is going down now ,COMMA measuring ,COMMA you know ,COMMA the properties and analyzing the rocks as it's going down ,COMMA you know ,COMMA that canyon .PERIOD <BREAK>
we've got a new one this year ,COMMA but we'll work on that next season .PERIOD <BREAK>
of course ,COMMA a lot of people think they already know the proper answer to the question ,COMMA what is beauty ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
so when we pitched toy story to tom hanks for the first time ,COMMA he walked in and he said ,COMMA you don't want me to sing ,COMMA do you ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
first of all ,COMMA we have all these things in our hands .PERIOD <BREAK>
and what this has allowed is the creation of origami-on-demand .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the best projection from the world bank is that this will happen ,COMMA and we will not have a divided world .PERIOD we'll have most people in the middle .PERIOD <BREAK>
pipa is short for protectip ,COMMA which is itself short for preventing real online threats to economic creativity and theft of intellectual property -- because the congressional aides who name these things have a lot of time on their hands .PERIOD <BREAK>
because if you open it up and reach inside ,COMMA you'd let the heat in ,COMMA the game would be over .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA my friend is strictly agnostic about the tooth fairy ,COMMA but it isn't very likely ,COMMA is it ?QUESTIONMARK like god .PERIOD <BREAK>
and suddenly ,COMMA brennan walked over to my chair and he grabbed the bell ,COMMA the bell i ring to signal a change or a reconvening of cabinets ,COMMA and he ran back to his seat ,COMMA rang the bell .PERIOD <BREAK>
our boys' deaths galvanize .PERIOD <BREAK>

you can put these things away ,COMMA and then you can be interrupted on your own schedule ,COMMA at your own time ,COMMA when you're available ,COMMA when you're ready to go again .PERIOD <BREAK>
i don't have to remind you of all the hype that was involved with the internet -- like getrich .PERIOD com .PERIOD <BREAK>

no ,COMMA it's because of the story ,COMMA because we feel personally involved in that story .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA when you look at that ,COMMA we said ,COMMA well ,COMMA we would like to ,COMMA then ,COMMA enable that a little bit .PERIOD we would like to create an initiative .PERIOD <BREAK>
if we can go back and redefine ourselves and become whole ,COMMA this will create a cultural shift in the world ,COMMA and it will give an example to younger generations so that they can reconceive their own lifespan .PERIOD <BREAK>

i felt as if the books needed me somehow ,COMMA and they were calling out to me and i was forsaking them .PERIOD <BREAK>

last slide .PERIOD <BREAK>

i became very interested in the landscape as a canadian .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA ladies and gentlemen ,COMMA at ted we talk a lot about leadership and how to make a movement .PERIOD <BREAK>
of course what we did when faced with such outrageous hyperbole .PERIOD <BREAK>
we've shared transportation .PERIOD <BREAK>
but those ways of being rational are not independent of one another ,COMMA so it's rational for a drug injector to share needles because of a stupid decision that's made by a politician ,COMMA and it's rational for a politician to make that stupid decision because they're responding to what they think the voters want .PERIOD <BREAK>
but the weird thing is ,COMMA we have not absorbed this lesson <NUM> years later ;SEMICOLON none of us really believes this .PERIOD <BREAK>
we want to match the hour-by-hour power supply .PERIOD <BREAK>

let's just do this experiment very quickly .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i started thinking about how else might we figure out what the prevalence of hiv was in africa in the past .PERIOD <BREAK>
this evidence is overwhelming at this point .PERIOD <BREAK>
now i want to show you one last video .PERIOD <BREAK>
and you can get at them remotely ,COMMA if you happen to have a laptop .PERIOD <BREAK>

my biggest challenge is your blocks to accept these victims as our own .PERIOD <BREAK>

i'm really scared .PERIOD <BREAK>

it's not accurately colored to how it is in real life .PERIOD <BREAK>
harmony is the notes that mozart didn't give you ,COMMA but somehow the contradiction of his notes suggest that .PERIOD <BREAK>

now as soon as i pop the teat ,COMMA sterile drinking water is going to come out .PERIOD <BREAK>
we're going to save lives ,COMMA but there's going to be a cost to it .PERIOD <BREAK>
when i was a child i knew nothing about this ,COMMA of course .PERIOD <BREAK>

or it was last year .PERIOD <BREAK>

not only -- thank you -- not only that .PERIOD <BREAK>
but that's not the whole story ,COMMA because there are signals ,COMMA electrical signals ,COMMA that travel along the branches of neurons and chemical signals that jump across from branch to branch .PERIOD <BREAK>
steaming ought to be faster .PERIOD <BREAK>
and we did .PERIOD the data was conclusive .PERIOD <BREAK>
these girls banded together and formed a group and launched a campaign for voter registration .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA again ,COMMA this idea of being able to put sound anywhere you want to is really starting to catch on .PERIOD <BREAK>
but we also must eat it with a ton of vegetables .PERIOD <BREAK>
in the mind of a man and a woman ,COMMA we're looking constantly at the contradiction between male and female ,COMMA we're looking for harmony within each other .PERIOD <BREAK>
there are applications you can get on smartphones for just a few dollars that do the same thing .PERIOD <BREAK>

as the child grows to become an adult :COLON so far ,COMMA it has been a consumer ,COMMA but the growth of a human being lies in his or her capacity to contribute ,COMMA to be a contributor .PERIOD <BREAK>
so you will cut <NUM> percent off of opec with eight million trucks .PERIOD <BREAK>
now one other thing happened around this same time .PERIOD <BREAK>
so we captured one of these ,COMMA and i brought it into the lab .PERIOD <BREAK>
or the <NUM> jaguar :COLON it's actually a crummy car ,COMMA falls apart all the time ,COMMA but the owners love it .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is the craft that was going on ,COMMA but there are a few collectors who also collect art which can depreciate .PERIOD <BREAK>
my colleagues actually went on to test this limitation ,COMMA by increasing the moment of inertia of a student ,COMMA so they had a tail ,COMMA and running them through and obstacle course ,COMMA and found a decrement in performance ,COMMA like you'd predict .PERIOD <BREAK>
you should be raising income and let people decide what they want to do with their money .PERIOD <BREAK>
there's always conflicting evidence .PERIOD <BREAK>

there are others who feel they can't confront compassion anymore ,COMMA and so they turn off the television and don't watch .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's to bring purpose to the lives of millions ,COMMA and he has succeeded .PERIOD <BREAK>
to me it's an incredible privilege to be alive now and to be able to witness this thing .PERIOD <BREAK>
i don't get necessarily inspired by research .PERIOD <BREAK>

and perhaps the greatest living person is someone i'm privileged to know ,COMMA joe rothblatt .PERIOD <BREAK>
you can see here a little bit of heart muscle beating in a dish .PERIOD <BREAK>

we're obsessed with morality as social creatures .PERIOD <BREAK>
the creator is a sharecropper in this story .PERIOD <BREAK>
thank you very much .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA would you like to have an extra <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> dollars when you're <NUM> is a question that's very different than ,COMMA imagine who you'll be when you're <NUM> :COLON will you be living ,COMMA what will you look like ,COMMA how much hair will you have ,COMMA who will you be living with .PERIOD <BREAK>

this is a headline from the daily telegraph in the u .PERIOD k .PERIOD <BREAK>
and they fear that the reason why it's developing a resistance is because cambodians can't afford the drugs on the commercial market ,COMMA and so they buy it from the internet .PERIOD <BREAK>
so they know what to do .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA let's see .PERIOD <BREAK>
you now have control over your own destiny .PERIOD <BREAK>
and then i went in and i got a global consulting job with accenture .PERIOD <BREAK>
he went on to say that selfish and contentious people will not cohere ,COMMA and without coherence nothing can be effected .PERIOD <BREAK>

so one of the reasons that i have come here to talk about this today is to -- frankly ,COMMA selfishly -- unburden myself and let it be known that this is not an untroubled mind that has written all of these books .PERIOD <BREAK>
in science ,COMMA we don't care how many letters you have after your name .PERIOD <BREAK>

at that moment i was less and less human ,COMMA i was also ,COMMA at the same time ,COMMA maybe the most human i've ever been .PERIOD <BREAK>

we don't know who he was .PERIOD <BREAK>
that's the land grant on the bottom half of the slide .PERIOD <BREAK>

they take this sanctuary in time very serious .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is not a person that is being studied at autopsy .PERIOD <BREAK>

now there's a couple -- there's a couple of lessons that you can take from this .PERIOD <BREAK>
we get most of these blood vessels when we're actually still in the womb ,COMMA and what that means is that as adults ,COMMA blood vessels don't normally grow .PERIOD <BREAK>
so we asked ourselves ,COMMA can the babies take statistics on a brand new language ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
i walked into the carnegie asking for a grant .PERIOD <BREAK>

and the tissue's very expensive .PERIOD <BREAK>

in that case ,COMMA we can see how where they think the flag had been changes as a function of how you change the shape and size of the environment .PERIOD <BREAK>
the advent of the interconnectedness and of the weapons of mass destruction means that ,COMMA increasingly ,COMMA i share a destiny with my enemy .PERIOD <BREAK>

thank you .PERIOD <BREAK>
our tools today don't look like shovels and picks .PERIOD <BREAK>
i can tell you ,COMMA there isn't a person in this room that would sit idly by .PERIOD <BREAK>

today in our modern world ,COMMA because of the internet ,COMMA because of the kinds of things people have been talking about here ,COMMA everything is connected to everything .PERIOD <BREAK>
court :COLON sleep .PERIOD <BREAK>
and they can repair themselves for longevity .PERIOD <BREAK>
we created technology and applications that engaged people's imaginations ,COMMA and it was really exciting .PERIOD <BREAK>
and this is a question ,COMMA i think ,COMMA which needs to be discussed carefully .PERIOD <BREAK>
she's a bit of a hippie .PERIOD <BREAK>
secondly ,COMMA shifting from a linear ,COMMA wasteful ,COMMA polluting way of using resources to a closed-loop model .PERIOD <BREAK>
these are people who were perfectly healthy two or three days before ,COMMA and then two days later ,COMMA they can no longer breathe ,COMMA and this polio virus has paralyzed not only their arms and their legs ,COMMA but also their breathing muscles .PERIOD <BREAK>
and this is a measure of how much well-being we get for our planetary resource use .PERIOD <BREAK>
so i will leave you with that .PERIOD thank you .PERIOD <BREAK>
well this is very valuable .PERIOD <BREAK>
he had one good eye .PERIOD <BREAK>
you cannot copyright a recipe because it's a set of instructions ,COMMA it's fact ,COMMA and you cannot copyright the look and feel of even the most unique dish .PERIOD <BREAK>
you're about to eat a lemon ,COMMA and now it tastes like lemonade .PERIOD <BREAK>
and there are others who are extremely high .PERIOD <BREAK>
i couldn't take it to a laboratory and experiment with it .PERIOD <BREAK>
when you're beginning to rot a little bit ,COMMA all of the videos crammed into your head ,COMMA all of the extensions that extend your various powers ,COMMA are going to being to seem a little secondary .PERIOD <BREAK>
but he seemed nervous .PERIOD <BREAK>
so they wait until winter -- the lake is completely frozen over -- and they use this meter-thick ice as a platform on which to establish their ice camp and do their work .PERIOD <BREAK>
i studied architecture ,COMMA then did a second degree in architecture ,COMMA and then actually quickly realized that it wasn't architecture .PERIOD <BREAK>
and then you'll hear people say ,COMMA well ,COMMA it doesn't really matter where i am ,COMMA as long as it's really early in the morning or really late at night or on the weekends .PERIOD <BREAK>
and those are titan and enceladus .PERIOD titan is saturn's largest moon ,COMMA and ,COMMA until cassini had arrived there ,COMMA was the largest single expanse of unexplored terrain that we had remaining in our solar system .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's nice poetry ,COMMA but that can't exactly be right .PERIOD <BREAK>
three weeks later ,COMMA i received a complete set of drawings saying we'd won the competition .PERIOD <BREAK>
so let me start in on that problem .PERIOD <BREAK>
and that really resonated with me .PERIOD <BREAK>
so what are the oceans going to be like in <NUM> or <NUM> years ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
i thought in getting up to my ted wish i would try to begin by putting in perspective what i try to do and how it fits with what they try to do .PERIOD <BREAK>
the crisis is almost certainly deepening around us .PERIOD <BREAK>
but first a little bit about this group of artists ,COMMA scientists ,COMMA and engineers that are working together .PERIOD <BREAK>
in fact ,COMMA the hull of the canoe is the womb of the vessel .PERIOD <BREAK>
let me be clear .PERIOD <BREAK>
so even in the situation that doesn't look as bad as this ,COMMA it's still affecting the amount of time these animals have to do their normal work .PERIOD <BREAK>
some people think this number's a little bit large ,COMMA but copyright mathematicians who are media lobby experts are merely surprised that it doesn't get compounded for inflation every year .PERIOD <BREAK>
now imagine what that means for you ,COMMA your family ,COMMA your friends ,COMMA your personal financial security .PERIOD <BREAK>
it'll never happen .PERIOD you don't have enough money .PERIOD <BREAK>
have you ever wanted to stay young a little longer and put off aging ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
so if you're in an emergency situation -- or if you're a mom about to deliver a baby -- forget it ,COMMA to get to the health care center .PERIOD <BREAK>
here ,COMMA i deliberately chose this because it is a man buying a vegetable .PERIOD <BREAK>
what i thought i would do is i would start with a simple request .PERIOD <BREAK>
optically activating these hundred or so cells into two strains of flies has dramatically different consequences .PERIOD <BREAK>
how much -- what's the total revenue ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
this is a picture at punta tombo in february showing all the penguins along the beach .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i can't help but enjoy looking at everything in the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
you only need to store things which are really going to effect movement .PERIOD <BREAK>
more importantly ,COMMA they prepare it for inspection and analysis by <NUM> independent laboratories in the united states and europe ,COMMA who will examine it for <NUM> different trace chemicals related to climate ,COMMA some in parts per quadrillion .PERIOD <BREAK>
because ,COMMA remember ,COMMA the web got to stand on top of all this heavy infrastructure that had been put in place because of the long-distance phone network .PERIOD <BREAK>
it vends out little individual vials .PERIOD <BREAK>
how many of you think of vulnerability and weakness synonymously ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
what happened in agriculture ?QUESTIONMARK well ,COMMA if you take agriculture over a century ,COMMA agriculture in about <NUM> would have been recognizable to somebody planting a thousand years earlier .PERIOD yeah ,COMMA the plows look different .PERIOD the machines were tractors or stuff instead of mules ,COMMA but the farmer would have understood :COLON this is what the guy's doing ,COMMA this is why he's doing it ,COMMA this is where he's going .PERIOD what really started to change in agriculture is when you started moving from this brute force engineering and chemistry into biology ,COMMA and that's where you get your productivity increases .PERIOD and as you do that stuff ,COMMA here's what happens to productivity .PERIOD <BREAK>
but the religious world doesn't think that way .PERIOD <BREAK>
why ?QUESTIONMARK because they think about problems differently than we do as technologists .PERIOD <BREAK>
many people became fat-phobic .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's a dendritic drainage pattern that can be formed only by the flow of liquids .PERIOD <BREAK>
they're trained to think more ,COMMA to try and de-escalate .PERIOD <BREAK>
the middle income countries ,COMMA the emerging economy ,COMMA they are catching up .PERIOD <BREAK>
it takes really a lot of time and it's expensive to train the operator to operate this complex arm .PERIOD <BREAK>
that's the instructions for running -- this is actually the source code for one of those universes ,COMMA with a note from the engineers saying they're having some problems .PERIOD <BREAK>
they're currently making a cocktail -- an antibody cocktail -- that can be used to treat severe ,COMMA overwhelming cases of flu .PERIOD <BREAK>
our expectations of what the oceans can produce is something that we don't really appreciate because we haven't seen it in our lifetimes .PERIOD <BREAK>
her understanding that a student-crafted honor code constitutes a reach towards perfection is incredible .PERIOD <BREAK>
we will be present throughout the volume of the ocean ,COMMA at will ,COMMA communicating in real time .PERIOD <BREAK>
you can actually cure t .PERIOD b .PERIOD even in hiv-positives .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is a deep question .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's a great story ,COMMA and it's understandable why they would be reluctant to revise it .PERIOD <BREAK>
you retrace the footsteps of abraham .PERIOD <BREAK>
you probably went out and bought them .PERIOD <BREAK>
but i just wanted to say -- and i mean this without irony -- i think i can speak for everybody in the audience when i say that i wish to god that you were the president of the united states .PERIOD <BREAK>
the whole point of this is to pull two people together strongly enough to begin to rear babies as a team .PERIOD <BREAK>
but it's one that i think we need to learn from .PERIOD <BREAK>
and he said ,COMMA she's telling me that i'm messy ,COMMA and i have to clean up my room .PERIOD <BREAK>
how about bed nets ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and i also understood that i would keep disappointing him .PERIOD <BREAK>
my mother's in the kitchen ,COMMA cooking ,COMMA and ,COMMA of all places ,COMMA in the hallway ,COMMA i realize he's about to do it ,COMMA about to take more than two steps .PERIOD <BREAK>
and most often we can do two interventions ,COMMA fix the meds mix .PERIOD <BREAK>
so a lot of what we see in the mesh ,COMMA and a lot of what we have in the platform that we built allows us to define ,COMMA refine and scale .PERIOD <BREAK>
then the second part will really just be examples of new technologies -- new media falling very much into that mold .PERIOD <BREAK>
affirmative action is not very popular frankly ,COMMA with white voters ,COMMA period .PERIOD <BREAK>
we craved but to favor the hem of her dress .PERIOD <BREAK>
about <NUM> percent of the adult population are infected .PERIOD <BREAK>
and thirdly ,COMMA public demand .PERIOD <BREAK>
so we came up with this ingenious idea ,COMMA which is used here on earth for helicopters .PERIOD <BREAK>
and then a wonderful thing happened when i was in high school :COLON gurus from the east started washing up on the shores of america .PERIOD <BREAK>
and then actually they track each other a little bit on the increase later in the decade .PERIOD <BREAK>
i figured i'd come back in a couple of weeks and talk to the grandmother .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is one substitution that i believe all of us ,COMMA in design management ,COMMA are guilty of .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's over <NUM> percent water ,COMMA so we need to let that evaporate .PERIOD <BREAK>
now there are a lot of reasons for that .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA the wind is now coming from the northeast out of india ,COMMA across the indian ocean ,COMMA this way towards africa .PERIOD <BREAK>
let me give it a little weapon on the tail here ,COMMA so it can fight .PERIOD <BREAK>
and for handicapped ,COMMA they can use this as a normal system .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is a picture that actually was sent back by the cassini space probe around saturn ,COMMA after we'd finished filming wonders of the solar system .PERIOD <BREAK>
and my favorite example of that occurred beginning in <NUM> ,COMMA when it was discovered that the bacteria causing legionnaires disease had always been present in natural waters ,COMMA but it was the precise temperature of the water in heating ,COMMA ventilating and air conditioning systems that raised the right temperature for the maximum reproduction of legionella bacillus .PERIOD <BREAK>
and really interesting stuff .PERIOD <BREAK>
it helps him when he is overwhelmed with grief and despair .PERIOD <BREAK>
i hope you'll drink ,COMMA tweet and plant some seeds to pollinate a friendly garden .PERIOD <BREAK>
most people assume we use photoshop .PERIOD <BREAK>
at this event ,COMMA dozens of people are twittering and thousands of people are following along because they want to know what it feels like to be here and what's happening .PERIOD <BREAK>
the consumer society is what you need for the industrial revolution to have a point .PERIOD <BREAK>
and two ,COMMA will it do it at a price that will enable the country to sustain a health care system without foreign donors after five to <NUM> years ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
when you have finished recording ,COMMA you may hang up .PERIOD no !EXCLAMATIONMARK <BREAK>
and what bayes showed was a mathematical way that you could do that .PERIOD <BREAK>
man :COLON one ,COMMA two ,COMMA three ,COMMA four folds we make .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is a little straw ,COMMA and what you do is you just nip two corners here ,COMMA and this becomes like a baby crocodile's mouth .PERIOD <BREAK>
somehow ,COMMA we have to explain how when you put together teams ,COMMA armies ,COMMA battalions of hundreds of millions of little robotic unconscious cells -- not so different really from a bacterium ,COMMA each one of them -- the result is this .PERIOD i mean ,COMMA just look at it .PERIOD <BREAK>
so i knew that had to be solved ,COMMA and had to be automatic .PERIOD <BREAK>
and that's why you cannot see down to the surface with our eyes in the visible region of the spectrum .PERIOD <BREAK>
so here's a new definition for doodling .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it turned out to be a pretty good year for this guy .PERIOD <BREAK>
it is compassion ,COMMA says the buddha ,COMMA which brings you to nirvana .PERIOD <BREAK>
this story ,COMMA like many of the stories in my chapters ,COMMA reads almost as an archetypal episode ,COMMA like something out of shakespeare ,COMMA that's happening now and will happen again in the future .PERIOD <BREAK>
in my view ,COMMA what we need today is people getting up and taking action to reclaim the meaning of peace .PERIOD <BREAK>
so let me summarize where we are .PERIOD <BREAK>
because this is what you will take away from here ,COMMA a reconnection with nature ,COMMA i hope .PERIOD <BREAK>
okay ,COMMA he's got his experimental notebook out .PERIOD <BREAK>
or in <NUM> ,COMMA the u .PERIOD k .PERIOD foreign secretary ,COMMA david miliband ,COMMA who said that at last we would deliver the decisive year .PERIOD <BREAK>
we have built our education systems on the model of fast food .PERIOD <BREAK>
so we took the same genetic algorithm that we used earlier to make that concentrator ,COMMA which didn't work out for us ,COMMA to optimize the stirling engine ,COMMA and make its design sizes and all of its dimensions the exact optimum to get the most power per dollar ,COMMA irrespective of weight ,COMMA irrespective of size ,COMMA to get the most conversion of solar energy ,COMMA because the sun is free .PERIOD <BREAK>
and if you blow those up ,COMMA they have these little structures on the end .PERIOD <BREAK>
they told her she couldn't love her vagina in high school ,COMMA that it was not a legal thing ,COMMA that it was not a moral thing ,COMMA that it was not a good thing .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's our real social lives themselves that are transmuted into art .PERIOD <BREAK>
but media abundance never works that way .PERIOD <BREAK>
look at it now .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so began to have multiple pens on the page -- again ,COMMA hard to do with our hands .PERIOD <BREAK>
like sir thomas ,COMMA you have this machine .PERIOD <BREAK>
and that certainly is going in the right direction .PERIOD <BREAK>
let's just pick one -- for example ,COMMA the one in the green shirt .PERIOD <BREAK>
she went back to the village .PERIOD that's her best friend's mother .PERIOD <BREAK>
speaking of which ,COMMA our fellow tedster ,COMMA al -- i first saw al do his slide show presentation on global warming in may of <NUM> .PERIOD <BREAK>
it was a table as long as this carpet and the harbor commissioner was here ,COMMA and i was here ,COMMA and my guys .PERIOD <BREAK>
and hansen is hard over for nuclear power ,COMMA as are most climatologists who are engaging this issue seriously .PERIOD <BREAK>
the same thing happened ,COMMA of course ,COMMA in the world of crime and terror .PERIOD <BREAK>
and you can see on this figure ,COMMA that the frequency range and the decibel range ,COMMA the dynamic range of music is far more heterogeneous .PERIOD <BREAK>
just that little bit of money ,COMMA which to me ,COMMA i wish it was in my bank account -- it's not ,COMMA but .PERIOD <BREAK>
look at this thing and say ,COMMA well ,COMMA i didn't think i was a very good sleeper ,COMMA but actually i did better than average in <NUM> to <NUM> year olds .PERIOD ok ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
but it's not a cri de coeur about man's hubris in the face of the elements .PERIOD <BREAK>
i'd like to tell you a little bit about the dark side ,COMMA with yesterday's theme .PERIOD <BREAK>
can you imagine that ?QUESTIONMARK i am the truth .PERIOD <BREAK>
that environment extends into our contemporary culture ,COMMA the thing our brain is challenged with .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it's largely what you would find in these books .PERIOD <BREAK>
but what makes the ross sea important is the vast sea of pack ice that in the spring and summer provides a wealth of phytoplankton and krill that supports what ,COMMA till recently ,COMMA has been a virtually intact near-shore ecosystem .PERIOD <BREAK>
and also ,COMMA you can engage in shape manipulation of that product ,COMMA but within boundaries that are safe .PERIOD <BREAK>
second ,COMMA we are both responsible for and the victims of our own pollution .PERIOD <BREAK>
well ,COMMA with experiments ,COMMA what you can do is answer a simple question .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so -- this is an over-simplification -- but basically ,COMMA it's not like you can just pass a radar signal right through <NUM> tons of steel in the sky .PERIOD <BREAK>
now ,COMMA take the same problem ,COMMA chunk it into little modules ,COMMA and motivations become trivial .PERIOD <BREAK>
there's some rather bored-looking gentlemen and some slightly engaged-looking ladies who are picking up something off that .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so we need a process of generating jobs ,COMMA for ordinary young men ,COMMA fast .PERIOD <BREAK>
the senses aren't fragile .PERIOD and if they were ,COMMA we wouldn't be here .PERIOD <BREAK>
e :COLON quack ,COMMA quack ,COMMA quack .PERIOD <BREAK>
they're endangered because we're moving towards social networking .PERIOD <BREAK>
i think we have discovered a very important issue in the arab world -- that people care ,COMMA people care about this great transformation .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA the technology ,COMMA you know ,COMMA isn't the most exciting thing here right now ,COMMA other than probably its newfound accessibility .PERIOD <BREAK>
dogs can distinguish two very similar fatty acids ,COMMA extremely diluted :COLON caprylic acid and caproic acid .PERIOD <BREAK>
we very strongly believe that the theatrics of a concert hall is as much in the space of intermission and the space of arrival as it is when the concert starts .PERIOD <BREAK>
and these spines don't always drive you to make the best choices .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's actually quite user-unfriendly .PERIOD <BREAK>
one was a motley collection of volunteers who just decided ,COMMA you know ,COMMA we really need this ,COMMA we should write one ,COMMA and what are we going to do with what -- well ,COMMA we're gonna share it !EXCLAMATIONMARK and other people will be able to develop it .PERIOD <BREAK>
and yet now it's represented in substantially finer grain .PERIOD <BREAK>
the last question of the assignment is :COLON how do you plan to use your life to positively impact other people ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
actually ,COMMA could you roll the clip ,COMMA please ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
so nobody likes particularly to -- you know ,COMMA aftershave with carcinogens .PERIOD <BREAK>
sometimes it's a global view ,COMMA to see our common roots and how we can use them to catch dreams .PERIOD <BREAK>
she was on larry king later ,COMMA and he said ,COMMA you're probably wondering how on earth this could happen to you twice .PERIOD and he said ,COMMA all i can say to you is ,COMMA this must be god's message to you ,COMMA honey .PERIOD from now on ,COMMA every day give your all ,COMMA love your all .PERIOD <BREAK>
i thought ,COMMA well that's not good enough .PERIOD <BREAK>
people really can learn a language with it .PERIOD <BREAK>
and you can take them on an emotional -- all pitches ,COMMA or all sales presentations ,COMMA are emotional at some level .PERIOD <BREAK>
well ,COMMA i was a grown man who had all of these rituals ,COMMA and it got so there was a throbbing ,COMMA there was a ferocious fear in my head .PERIOD <BREAK>
you don't know what i'm talking about ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
step inside of the tiny ,COMMA little world of somebody else .PERIOD <BREAK>
and some situations allow anybody to do it more effectively than other situations do .PERIOD <BREAK>
carolyn porco mentioned another one called enceladus the other day .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it was a technology that was inevitable .PERIOD <BREAK>
currently there are <NUM> million cellphones in indian hands ,COMMA in india .PERIOD <BREAK>
so it's a real desert for not only for the penguins and the sea lions and the marine iguanas .PERIOD <BREAK>
ace of diamonds .PERIOD <BREAK>
i'll admit that there are times when it seems like mission :COLON impossible ,COMMA but we must believe that these kids are smart .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA act ii :COLON a home reconstructed .PERIOD <BREAK>
are they coming from india against the wind ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and the people thought ,COMMA you know ,COMMA you're right .PERIOD <BREAK>
you start to believe that it's alive and aware .PERIOD <BREAK>
and at the time ,COMMA she was miserable .PERIOD <BREAK>
so the concerns ,COMMA the xenophobic concerns of today ,COMMA of migration ,COMMA will be turned on their head ,COMMA as we search for people to help us sort out our pensions and our economies in the future .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i said ,COMMA yeah ,COMMA that i'm going to have a party and a cake and get a lot of presents ?QUESTIONMARK and my dad said ,COMMA well ,COMMA yes .PERIOD <BREAK>
more anti-retrovirals make sense .PERIOD <BREAK>
milo :COLON i wonder how deep it is .PERIOD <BREAK>
in fact ,COMMA the whole era of laboratory medicine is completely changing .PERIOD <BREAK>
sayyid qutb is one of the founding fathers of fanatical islam ,COMMA one of the ideologues that inspired osama bin laden .PERIOD <BREAK>
the result :COLON most of the deaths have been in people under <NUM> years of age ,COMMA robustly healthy young adults .PERIOD <BREAK>
and what is happening today is ,COMMA in one sense ,COMMA frightening because it's never happened before .PERIOD <BREAK>
and up i climb ,COMMA i turn .PERIOD <BREAK>
and that means that ,COMMA maybe if we tweak it a little bit ,COMMA we can increase the health and longevity of people .PERIOD <BREAK>
so this gets a little challenging because the dynamics of this robot are quite complicated .PERIOD <BREAK>
he said ,COMMA one feels inclined to say that the intention that man should be happy is not included in the plan of creation .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so ,COMMA in some sense ,COMMA this talk today is my answer to that .PERIOD <BREAK>
the babies in the united states are getting a lot better ,COMMA babies in japan are getting a lot worse ,COMMA but both of those groups of babies are preparing for exactly the language that they are going to learn .PERIOD <BREAK>
that's where he discovered something totally magical ,COMMA and when he talks about it ,COMMA it's fascinating -- it's the magic of dyeing chemistry .PERIOD <BREAK>
in may <NUM> ,COMMA estonia was the victim of cyberattacks ,COMMA that damaged its communication and banking systems .PERIOD <BREAK>
imagine if every one of these buses in lagos was part of the mesh network .PERIOD <BREAK>
they accused him of paying off the judges .PERIOD <BREAK>
and that's a story i'm going to tell you about today .PERIOD <BREAK>
we've extended this to the air now with a grant from the sloan foundation .PERIOD <BREAK>
and her baby will receive pmtct ,COMMA which will mean that that baby can be born free of the virus .PERIOD <BREAK>
if there's one million americans -- and i really know this -- who are ready to make phone calls ,COMMA who are ready to be on email ,COMMA i am absolutely sure that we can actually change the course of history ,COMMA literally ,COMMA for the continent of africa .PERIOD <BREAK>
video :COLON you going to help get some sticks ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
here a community camp just organized by the community themselves ,COMMA where they find a place ,COMMA organize volunteers ,COMMA and then we'll do our part .PERIOD you know ,COMMA check their vision ,COMMA and then you have doctors who you find out what the problem is and then determine what further testing should be done ,COMMA and then those tests are done by technicians who check for glasses ,COMMA or check for glaucoma .PERIOD <BREAK>
that would mean that your child ,COMMA you would expect it to gain the weight of six titanics .PERIOD <BREAK>
if i doubt my older sister's ability to pay back the <NUM> percent interest i established on her last loan ,COMMA i'm going to withhold her ability to get more money from me until she pays it back .PERIOD <BREAK>
so we may consider that the more those are invading our mind ,COMMA and ,COMMA like a chain reaction ,COMMA the more we feel miserable ,COMMA we feel tormented .PERIOD <BREAK>
but she looks up and says this ,COMMA and it occurs to me ,COMMA well ,COMMA kids aren't going to mind these things ,COMMA and they don't vote ,COMMA and business people and then young adults aren't going to mind these things -- they're pretty cool -- so i guess subliminally i was worried that it's the older population that's going to worry .PERIOD <BREAK>
now ,COMMA we put a lot of money into education ,COMMA and i really think that education is the most important thing to get right for the country to have as strong a future as it should have .PERIOD <BREAK>
<NUM> th man :COLON if i was to go back to iraq and speak to the people ,COMMA i'd have to bow down and kiss their feet .PERIOD <BREAK>
they were creating subsidies either for large farms ,COMMA or they were giving inputs to the farmers that they thought they should use ,COMMA rather than that the farmers wanted to use .PERIOD <BREAK>
he meant that you can see the sky and that you can experience the sun .PERIOD <BREAK>
there's a second big project ,COMMA recently funded by the wellcome trust in this country ,COMMA involving very large studies -- thousands of individuals ,COMMA with each of eight different diseases ,COMMA common diseases like type- <NUM> and type- <NUM> diabetes ,COMMA and coronary heart disease ,COMMA bipolar disease and so on -- to try and understand the genetics .PERIOD <BREAK>
the largest organism on the planet is a mycelial mat ,COMMA one cell wall thick .PERIOD <BREAK>
because when people all share values ,COMMA when people all share morals ,COMMA they become a team ,COMMA and once you engage the psychology of teams ,COMMA it shuts down open-minded thinking .PERIOD <BREAK>
thanks .PERIOD thank you .PERIOD <BREAK>
nineteen million hectares of rainforest are lost every year to create new arable land .PERIOD <BREAK>
and we got to do the wise study -- and the wise stands for women's ischemia syndrome evaluation -- and i have chaired this study for the last <NUM> years .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's something called the reward schedule .PERIOD <BREAK>
have our presidents and our leaders -- everyone is talking about -- have they ever called these people together and said ,COMMA look ,COMMA your foundation and your foundation -- you have so much money ,COMMA we are grateful .PERIOD <BREAK>
so if you're a software engineer and you're trying to think about whether to add some new functionality to your program ,COMMA it's important to think about how much it costs .PERIOD <BREAK>
nasa has devoted money to this .PERIOD <BREAK>
yeah .PERIOD <BREAK>
you look back on your day ,COMMA and you're like ,COMMA i got nothing done today .PERIOD <BREAK>
this must be the mine .PERIOD <BREAK>
but seriously ,COMMA we also have this phenomenon on madison avenue and in other places ,COMMA where people are actually walking out of luxury boutiques with ordinary ,COMMA sort of generic paper bags to hide the brand purchases .PERIOD <BREAK>
they keep doing it ;SEMICOLON they just keep making these things .PERIOD <BREAK>
you'd better leave now if you don't want to know some of these tricks .PERIOD <BREAK>
about eight hours later ,COMMA we found this kid .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA this was the contents page originally .PERIOD <BREAK>
we live in a digital world ,COMMA but we're fairly analog creatures .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA social investments in health ,COMMA education and infrastructure ,COMMA and electricity is really what is needed in india and china .PERIOD <BREAK>
now ,COMMA you’re not as thick as two short planks ,COMMA but you sound like it when you say earth ,COMMA because that demonstration ,COMMA if i turned around this way -- that earth plane would be as thin as paper .PERIOD <BREAK>
but when you let every student work at their own pace -- and we see it over and over and over again -- you see students who took a little bit [of] extra time on one concept or the other ,COMMA but once they get through that concept ,COMMA they just race ahead .PERIOD <BREAK>
we need to see deep trenches ,COMMA the undersea mountains ,COMMA and understand life in the deep sea .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA siberia ,COMMA manchuria .PERIOD <BREAK>
thank you very much .PERIOD <BREAK>
where is the small hadron collider ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
well ,COMMA there is a big difference in the way we used to talk about oil and the way we're talking about it now .PERIOD <BREAK>
thank you very much .PERIOD <BREAK>
i was raised on free to be you and me -- hip-hop -- not as many woohoos for hip-hop in the house .PERIOD <BREAK>
slinky :COLON i'm sorry ,COMMA woody ,COMMA but i have to agree with them .PERIOD <BREAK>
people do get hiv because they do stupid things ,COMMA but most of them are doing stupid things for perfectly rational reasons .PERIOD <BREAK>
spiders use silk for many purposes ,COMMA including the trailing safety dragline ,COMMA wrapping eggs for reproduction ,COMMA protective retreats and catching prey .PERIOD <BREAK>
we are one people together .PERIOD <BREAK>
it really is just a new idea .PERIOD <BREAK>
that's about it .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the question that i'd like to leave you with is this :COLON will your tribes change the world ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
but they won't come to us directly through light .PERIOD <BREAK>
what was so upsetting about this new piece of information was not that i was going to have to change the date of my slumber party with all of my girlfriends ,COMMA what was most upsetting was that this meant that i was not a virgo .PERIOD <BREAK>
we're developing these tools ,COMMA but we share them freely with hundreds of groups all over the world ,COMMA so people can study and try to treat different disorders .PERIOD <BREAK>
and turning around you is shhhhhhhhhhhhh ,COMMA like that .PERIOD <BREAK>
you can see ,COMMA actually that's a fluoroscopy .PERIOD <BREAK>
they got on a boat ,COMMA and yet another divergence -- the boat was either going to canada or to australia .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so she improvised a sentence -- <NUM> months ,COMMA and not only that ,COMMA but release every day to go to work .PERIOD <BREAK>
and father mcgetrick was completely unflustered ,COMMA just stirred his tea and looked at my mother and said ,COMMA it's all right daphne ,COMMA i'm scottish .PERIOD <BREAK>
and in this ,COMMA towns begin to rethink how they organize the urban landscape ,COMMA so that people are encouraged to slow down and smell the roses and connect with one another .PERIOD <BREAK>
we now think there are likely to be only just over <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> genes in the human genome .PERIOD <BREAK>
and humor is a good way ,COMMA i think ,COMMA to address serious issues .PERIOD <BREAK>
the twentieth century was that century where ,COMMA at least for those places we know the best ,COMMA culture moved from this read-write to read-only existence .PERIOD <BREAK>
they're eminently qualified to make flat screen tvs .PERIOD <BREAK>
so here i am in this space ,COMMA and my job -- and any stress related to my job -- it was gone .PERIOD <BREAK>
so what we need to do is to figure out a way of looking at the things we do want to look at and make things transparent that we don't want to look at .PERIOD <BREAK>
it was about inspiration and determination and never giving up on my interest for science and learning and growing .PERIOD <BREAK>
and our engineering colleagues are making one of the largest dynamically varying computers in the world for this kind of data exploration .PERIOD <BREAK>
they took off her colorful sari .PERIOD <BREAK>
so i looked ,COMMA and like the thousands of people that had tried before ,COMMA i found nothing .PERIOD <BREAK>
i'm laughing out loud .PERIOD <BREAK>
and temporarily ,COMMA very unexpectedly ,COMMA they dropped .PERIOD <BREAK>
so anyway ,COMMA we found activity in three brain regions .PERIOD <BREAK>
as we passed ,COMMA two boys were climbing the mount kenya of trash .PERIOD <BREAK>
economics has become the currency of policy .PERIOD <BREAK>
i'm a believer .PERIOD <BREAK>
we're funded by donations from the public ,COMMA and one of the more interesting things about that is how little money it actually takes to run wikipedia .PERIOD <BREAK>
i found that i would have to build them myself .PERIOD <BREAK>
and my final question was always the same .PERIOD <BREAK>
national message .PERIOD targeted individuals .PERIOD <BREAK>
i ,COMMA as the conductor ,COMMA have to come to the rehearsal with a cast-iron sense of the outer architecture of that music ,COMMA within which there is then immense personal freedom for the members of the orchestra to shine .PERIOD <BREAK>
why is it that business leaders and investors quite often don't see the connection between creating the intangible of employee happiness with creating the tangible of financial profits in their business ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>

but if we look at companies like puma -- jochen zeitz ,COMMA their ceo and chairman ,COMMA once challenged me at a function ,COMMA saying that he's going to implement my project before i finish it .PERIOD <BREAK>
so i just thought ,COMMA i'm going to capture thumbprint ,COMMA footprint ,COMMA or whatever traces we leave as humans .PERIOD <BREAK>
i don't think so -- quite the opposite .PERIOD <BREAK>
there's something almost quite magical about visual information .PERIOD <BREAK>
whereas if we start building this demand on the ground on a civilizational level ,COMMA rather than merely on a political level ,COMMA a level above politics -- movements that are not political parties ,COMMA but are rather creating this civilizational demand for this democratic culture .PERIOD <BREAK>
this wasn't just an economic story .PERIOD <BREAK>
in the <NUM> s and <NUM> s ,COMMA the vietnam war was basically shown in america's living rooms day in ,COMMA day out .PERIOD <BREAK>
now ,COMMA imagine building that up to a city ,COMMA or to a society ,COMMA and you've got ,COMMA obviously ,COMMA an interesting problem .PERIOD <BREAK>
that's what you might think .PERIOD <BREAK>
then half of them announced their commitment to this goal to the room ,COMMA and half didn't .PERIOD <BREAK>
so basically ,COMMA metabolism ,COMMA which is defined as basically everything that keeps us alive from one day to the next ,COMMA has side effects .PERIOD <BREAK>
we're all effectively part of an extended african family .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's effortless ,COMMA it literally pours in .PERIOD <BREAK>

so sometimes i get invited to give weird talks .PERIOD <BREAK>
all of these girls went to the gold mine ,COMMA and they were predominantly prostitutes doing other things .PERIOD <BREAK>

they had their prom in the mall .PERIOD they loved their mall .PERIOD <BREAK>
now the easiest analogy for swap-trading is like an online dating service for all your unwanted media .PERIOD <BREAK>
in fact ,COMMA these guys actually work for nasa ,COMMA and they're trying to pioneer using off-the-shelf components ,COMMA cheap things that aren't specialized that they can combine and send up into space .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i've come up ,COMMA and all i wanted to do was get out of the water .PERIOD <BREAK>

how did the elite deal with that -- the so-called political elite ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
how do you design that nozzle ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
i don't really understand why you're laughing .PERIOD <BREAK>
so my brother-in-law goes to interview this killer and he realizes when he meets him that this guy is absolutely terrifying .PERIOD <BREAK>
now the doha tribeca film festival is not an imported festival ,COMMA but rather an important festival between the cities of new york and doha .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's about <NUM> million years old .PERIOD <BREAK>
we have a pan that's too small !EXCLAMATIONMARK <BREAK>
why i thought i was going to be able to do that ,COMMA i don't know .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i realize that mystery is the catalyst for imagination .PERIOD <BREAK>
if you put their foot under water ,COMMA they grab on .PERIOD <BREAK>
a guy who's added it up all this very well is david mackay ,COMMA a physicist in england ,COMMA and in his wonderful book ,COMMA sustainable energy ,COMMA among other things ,COMMA he says ,COMMA i'm not trying to be pro-nuclear .PERIOD i'm just pro-arithmetic .PERIOD <BREAK>
another rock came into the earth's atmosphere and this one blew up above the ground ,COMMA several miles up above the surface of the earth .PERIOD <BREAK>
one last piece about this ,COMMA of course ,COMMA is that it's enabled by wireless technologies .PERIOD <BREAK>
and ,COMMA yes ,COMMA there are things like grameen bank and micro-lending .PERIOD <BREAK>
sure you were ,COMMA because you've prepared your entire life for this historic quadrennial event that just sort of sneaks up on you .PERIOD <BREAK>
there isn't the technology to do that .PERIOD <BREAK>
but the fact that those dictators suppressed democracy in their country and suppressed islamic groups in their country actually made the islamists much more strident .PERIOD <BREAK>
because i love mobius loops .PERIOD i not only love mobius loops ,COMMA but i'm one of the very few people ,COMMA if not the only person in the world ,COMMA that makes klein bottles .PERIOD <BREAK>
then we lost our economy and we went back down to <NUM> -- sometimes it's <NUM> ,COMMA sometimes it's <NUM> .PERIOD <BREAK>
life adds information to matter .PERIOD <BREAK>
well ,COMMA here's the dirty little secret .PERIOD <BREAK>
michael pritchard :COLON okay .PERIOD we've got some runoff from a sewage plant farm .PERIOD <BREAK>

it was very brute force ;SEMICOLON it was very inelegant .PERIOD <BREAK>
they've been sponsoring a design competition to come up with innovative medical housing solutions ,COMMA clinic solutions ,COMMA in africa ,COMMA and they've had a design competition .PERIOD <BREAK>
i just don't believe that .PERIOD <BREAK>
well ,COMMA i'd happened to have had a couple of drinks before boarding -- i do that to steel my nerves -- and so i imitate a train call ,COMMA holding my hand on my -- 'george orwell ,COMMA your time has come ,COMMA ' you see .PERIOD <BREAK>
because we aim low and we think small when it comes to women .PERIOD <BREAK>
because we know that our experience of the world and of ourselves within it is realized in the brain -- whatever happens after death .PERIOD <BREAK>
lyn :COLON when i'm making music ,COMMA i feel like a pilot in the cockpit flying an airplane .PERIOD <BREAK>
but you do meet some fantastic people ,COMMA people who look at the world in a totally different way .PERIOD <BREAK>
a friend came to see me last year -- and she doesn't mind me telling this story -- a friend came to see me last year and said ,COMMA nigel ,COMMA i've read your book .PERIOD <BREAK>

and we all noticed immediately that this project had no economic benefits :COLON it had no clients ,COMMA nobody would buy the electricity there ,COMMA nobody was interested in irrigation projects .PERIOD <BREAK>
within a few minutes ,COMMA she went into cardiac collapse .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is what bread has taught me in my journey .PERIOD <BREAK>
he’s not taking care of his troops .PERIOD <BREAK>
people came to study our reefs from australia ,COMMA which is sort of funny because now we go to theirs .PERIOD <BREAK>
so every year ,COMMA june <NUM> ,COMMA we will commemorate all those comrades or students who died .PERIOD <BREAK>
how do we try to understand what china is ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and i just wanted to personalize that .PERIOD <BREAK>
i can't grind it up in a blender .PERIOD <BREAK>
in fact ,COMMA there's many more male geniuses in the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
but many of you have said ,COMMA if you get these marine protected areas ,COMMA or a reasonable regime for high seas fisheries management in place ,COMMA how are you going to enforce it ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
that day ,COMMA i realized i had an unwelcome ,COMMA uninvited ,COMMA new life partner .PERIOD <BREAK>
for the second demo ,COMMA i have this wii remote that's actually next to the tv .PERIOD <BREAK>
chris anderson :COLON okay ,COMMA well that makes sense .PERIOD thanks a lot misha .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it's destroying that precious benthic community on the bottom ,COMMA things like sponges and corals ,COMMA that critical habitat for other animals .PERIOD <BREAK>
but they have no incentive to do so .PERIOD <BREAK>
here's another crowd in mecca .PERIOD <BREAK>
well ,COMMA i do .PERIOD <BREAK>
so when i virtually touch data ,COMMA it will generate forces in the pen ,COMMA so i get a feedback .PERIOD <BREAK>
so you've got this highly stylized portrait of something that was not entirely of this earth -- it was a portrait of a star .PERIOD <BREAK>
so how can we know about the project ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and a scheme emerged that long now is looking to see if it might be possible to buy up the whole valley ,COMMA because those <NUM> ranches with their <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> acres dominate a <NUM> square mile valley with their grazing allotments and so on ,COMMA and there's a possibility that you could get the whole thing for five million dollars and gradually restore it to its wild condition ,COMMA and somewhere in the process turn it back over to the national park ,COMMA and it would double the size of great basin national park .PERIOD that would be swell .PERIOD <BREAK>
guns are not a part of our lives .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's brilliant .PERIOD it's a way to get sodium and glucose together so that when you add it to water the child is able to absorb it even during situations of diarrhea .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i mean ,COMMA in the original it's completely unclear to see what this tangle of colors and shapes is supposed to depict .PERIOD <BREAK>
because the web of the spider ,COMMA it was sending me insane ,COMMA because i couldn't get the web to move off .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i want to call your attention to some of the side effects of going the institutional route .PERIOD <BREAK>
what i do is i write books about the cultural history of physics .PERIOD <BREAK>
he was later ,COMMA it's said ,COMMA the basis of the indiana jones character .PERIOD <BREAK>
so we're beyond the <NUM> -second steps .PERIOD <BREAK>
well ,COMMA because these sort of things reveal what the true state of ,COMMA say ,COMMA arab governments are like ,COMMA the true human-rights abuses in those governments .PERIOD <BREAK>
look at these dinosaurs .PERIOD <BREAK>
i want to go back though to this graph that i showed you earlier where we put it all together to make two points .PERIOD <BREAK>
i want to wipe the smudges clean .PERIOD <BREAK>
and while a student at hawaii ,COMMA i worked at the waikiki aquarium .PERIOD <BREAK>
it'll sound corny ,COMMA but it's sincere .PERIOD <BREAK>
they have located two consultants ,COMMA frank wilson and nate johnson ,COMMA who are -- frank wilson is a neurologist ,COMMA nate johnson is a mechanic .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i think this applies across a very broad -- sort of ,COMMA a lot of concepts .PERIOD <BREAK>
they get a little shorter at <NUM> a .PERIOD m .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's value created by the participants for each other .PERIOD <BREAK>
and they went surfing .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so we expect -- it's not much fun .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's kind of out past mars .PERIOD it's a hike .PERIOD <BREAK>
i have strategically cut matt's head out of this photo ,COMMA because he would kill me if he knew i was using it because of the sweatsuits .PERIOD <BREAK>
so now the next question you may have is ,COMMA well why can't we just pay people to do this ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
it's built up of a huge number of these little tiny filaments of vibrating energy ,COMMA vibrating in different frequencies .PERIOD <BREAK>
sure enough ,COMMA we all buy into that ,COMMA and with gated communities ,COMMA we have a formalized expectation with a homeowners association .PERIOD <BREAK>
but the octopus did .PERIOD <BREAK>
is this science fiction ?QUESTIONMARK no ,COMMA because i'm wearing the first application of this technology .PERIOD <BREAK>
but they're necessary :COLON they're necessary to make that mathematics work .PERIOD <BREAK>
that perhaps will allow us to identify the cause of a cancer that afflicts us or identify the source of an outbreak that we aren't familiar with or perhaps create a new tool in molecular biology .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i look down at my arm and i realize that i can no longer define the boundaries of my body .PERIOD <BREAK>
so if we want to find a better way of doing that kind of work ,COMMA we need look only no farther than africa to find these robust self-organizing algorithms .PERIOD <BREAK>
now this is the part of the nervous system that deals with the things that we don't consciously control ,COMMA like digestion ,COMMA heart rate and sexual arousal .PERIOD <BREAK>
they can put it in an envelope and mail it to you ,COMMA and then say in no uncertain terms ,COMMA please cut that out .PERIOD <BREAK>
but the toxic smells -- when you come into a town that's actually doing this kind of burning of the boards ,COMMA you can smell it a good five or <NUM> kilometers before you get there .PERIOD <BREAK>
and then about a year and a half ago ,COMMA google actually acquired this company .PERIOD <BREAK>
there's a big river called the gulf stream that runs across and it's not going in the direction you are .PERIOD <BREAK>
and in africa ,COMMA the remote places ,COMMA it's hard to find a good road .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i thought that was incredibly peculiar .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA we circle around the coliseum ,COMMA past the church of santa maria in cosmedin and the temple of hercules towards the river .PERIOD <BREAK>
i'm a composer ,COMMA orchestrally-trained ,COMMA and the inventor of the allosphere .PERIOD <BREAK>
that was one idea :COLON that we would have different actors ,COMMA and we would hand off from actor to actor .PERIOD <BREAK>
and aggregated ,COMMA these smaller interceptions could actually infiltrate all the roadborne pollution that now runs into the estuary system ,COMMA up to a seven inch rain event ,COMMA up to a hundred-year storm .PERIOD <BREAK>
it is written in mathematical language ,COMMA and the letters are triangles ,COMMA circles and other geometric figures ,COMMA without which means it is humanly impossible to comprehend a single word .PERIOD <BREAK>
we might just have to accept the fact that we're error prone and try to design things around it .PERIOD <BREAK>
that's the pacific gyre .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's getting wuzzier all the time as we find animals doing things that we ,COMMA in our arrogance ,COMMA used to think was just human .PERIOD <BREAK>
and ,COMMA you know ,COMMA after keeping these books for a number of years ,COMMA i started to become very interested in collecting not only my own personal artifacts ,COMMA but also the artifacts of other people .PERIOD <BREAK>
like ,COMMA take ,COMMA for instance ,COMMA your pacemaker cells in your heart right now .PERIOD <BREAK>
why do we respond so much to our knowledge of where something comes from ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
most of the time ,COMMA you want to print one copy of your document ,COMMA in page order ,COMMA on that printer .PERIOD <BREAK>
so now i have to really figure out all kinds of stuff i don't know how to do .PERIOD <BREAK>
and when he passed on ,COMMA i took this table with me and brought it to my office ,COMMA and it reminds me of him .PERIOD <BREAK>
we have a successful company because of timing ,COMMA and because of perseverance ,COMMA but it's simple stuff -- it's not rocket science .PERIOD <BREAK>
we could talk about a kind of soul ,COMMA of a ghost compelling them .PERIOD <BREAK>
maybe you've encountered the zero-to-three movement ,COMMA which asserts that the most important years for learning are the earliest ones .PERIOD <BREAK>
since the big content markets have grown in line with historic norms ,COMMA it's not additional growth that piracy has prevented ,COMMA but copyright math tells us it must therefore be foregone growth in a market that has no historic norms -- one that didn't exist in the <NUM> 's .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is only <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> galaxies .PERIOD <BREAK>
yeah well we don't talk about that .PERIOD let's talk about something interesting .PERIOD <BREAK>
we depend on pollinators for over a third of the fruits and vegetables we eat .PERIOD <BREAK>
some of the greatest innovations and developments in the world often happen at the intersection of two fields .PERIOD <BREAK>
one of the things i want you to note from it is blood -- that you see a tremendous amount of blood contact .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA recently ,COMMA we have realized that the ordinary matter in the universe -- and by ordinary matter ,COMMA i mean you ,COMMA me ,COMMA the planets ,COMMA the stars ,COMMA the galaxies -- the ordinary matter makes up only a few percent of the content of the universe .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i came from a very privileged background .PERIOD i was very lucky .PERIOD <BREAK>
well ,COMMA as best we can tell ,COMMA there are about two to three million disks having been published -- so <NUM> s ,COMMA long-playing records and cds -- or at least that's the largest archives of published materials we've been able to sort of point at .PERIOD <BREAK>
and then they said to the physician ,COMMA you decided a few weeks ago that nothing is working for this patient .PERIOD <BREAK>
you could begin with the one that we began with a couple of days ago ,COMMA which was fear .PERIOD <BREAK>
everywhere on earth .PERIOD <BREAK>
and you can probably think of many ,COMMA many more in your own everyday lives .PERIOD <BREAK>
coral is a very beautiful and unusual animal .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i watched them being locked up in prison and tear gassed .PERIOD <BREAK>
but in fact ,COMMA emotions are an all-systems alert that change what we remember ,COMMA what kind of decisions we make ,COMMA and how we perceive things .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i went wild eyed and thought i was going to die .PERIOD <BREAK>
and some of them are mid-level employees at internet service providers around the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
so we figured out some pretty interesting ways to track co <NUM> levels in the atmosphere ,COMMA going back millions of years .PERIOD <BREAK>
and this will take time .PERIOD <BREAK>
and we should save trees in the end .PERIOD <BREAK>
and what we have here -- can everyone see <NUM> purple surfaces on your left ,COMMA and <NUM> ,COMMA call it yellowish ,COMMA surfaces on your right ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and they're sitting there at the long boardroom table with all the drawings ,COMMA and the renderings ,COMMA and all the chinese food caskets are lying on the table ,COMMA and -- i mean ,COMMA what was the conversation that was going on there ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
one of them was i used to lie on the kitchen floor of my childhood home ,COMMA and i would suck the thumb of my left hand and hold my mom's cold toes with my right hand .PERIOD <BREAK>
several weeks ago greenland's [ <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> ] people voted themselves self-governance rights from denmark .PERIOD <BREAK>

architects tend to work with signature ,COMMA so that an architect needs a signature and that signature has to work across the scale of houses up to ,COMMA say ,COMMA skyscrapers ,COMMA and that problem of signatures is a thing we're very good at maintaining and working with ;SEMICOLON and intricacy ,COMMA which is the relationship of ,COMMA say ,COMMA the shape of a building ,COMMA its structure ,COMMA its windows ,COMMA its color ,COMMA its pattern .PERIOD these are real architectural problems .PERIOD <BREAK>
for example ,COMMA we presented this word .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is the classic gartner hype curve ,COMMA which talks about kind of the trajectory of a technology's lifespan .PERIOD <BREAK>
we don't see scenes like this anymore because of vaccines .PERIOD <BREAK>
darwin wouldn’t make sense in an aristotelian universe ,COMMA and wouldn’t really make sense in a newtonian universe .PERIOD <BREAK>
they attract people to learning because it's really a dance project or a circus project or ,COMMA the best example of all -- el sistema in venezuela -- it's a music project .PERIOD <BREAK>
so it brings me to my main take-home message ,COMMA which is we can avert a tragedy of the commons .PERIOD <BREAK>
so this was not what they call a laboratory-scale experiment ,COMMA and they wouldn’t have liked it at my college .PERIOD <BREAK>
i mean ,COMMA these kids ,COMMA without control ,COMMA throwing molotov cocktails ,COMMA attacking the cops and the firemen ,COMMA looting everything they could in the shops .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA there is the building ,COMMA there is what we call the draw .PERIOD <BREAK>
now this is the neurological goldmine ,COMMA if you like ,COMMA because a known reward excites people ,COMMA but what really gets them going is the uncertain reward ,COMMA the reward pitched at the right level of uncertainty ,COMMA that they didn't quite know whether they were going to get it or not .PERIOD <BREAK>
he had another fan opposed to it that he had like a -- i mean ,COMMA the way i would have done this would be ,COMMA like ,COMMA a rubber band ,COMMA and ,COMMA you know ,COMMA around a tinker toy kind of fan .PERIOD <BREAK>

she'd stand me in the sink to pee because there was never room in the toilet .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's kind of taken on a life of its own .PERIOD <BREAK>

because archaeology gives us an opportunity to study past civilizations ,COMMA and see where they succeeded and where they failed .PERIOD <BREAK>
this year -- maybe you could show the slides -- this year we're carrying this treo ,COMMA which we had a lot to do with and helped handspring design it .PERIOD <BREAK>

there are many ways to be a mammal .PERIOD a 'roo hops in oz ;SEMICOLON a horse runs in asia ;SEMICOLON and a wolf evolves stilt legs in brazil .PERIOD <BREAK>

i showed you the shots ,COMMA i proved it in the powerpoint ,COMMA and i think i will convince you also by culture .PERIOD <BREAK>
secondly you need skills ,COMMA the mundane skills of the construction sector .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the final ,COMMA sort of ,COMMA formulation of this american idol format ,COMMA which has just appeared in afghanistan ,COMMA is a new program called the candidate .PERIOD <BREAK>

our mother ,COMMA mexico ,COMMA is being violated before our very eyes .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's grown in my mind ,COMMA and then it's grown in terms of the whole process that i go through .PERIOD <BREAK>

i don't remember the rape part of it so much as much as the anger part of it .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it looks for things that move around .PERIOD <BREAK>
it comes back at times of great transformation ,COMMA globalization being one of those transformations .PERIOD <BREAK>
we were asked in the past when we bought an electric car to pay for the entire well ,COMMA for the life of the car .PERIOD <BREAK>
okay ,COMMA now getting to a part -- i want to show design in illusions .PERIOD i believe that the first example of illusions being used purposely was by da vinci in this anamorphic image of an eye .PERIOD so that when you saw from one little angle was like this .PERIOD and this little technique got popular in the <NUM> th century and the <NUM> th century to disguise hidden meanings ,COMMA where you could flip the image and see it from one little point of view like this .PERIOD <BREAK>
how would it be possible to experience a sense of invisibility ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>

and thus ,COMMA as people started feeling ownership over wildlife ,COMMA wildlife numbers started coming back ,COMMA and that's actually becoming a foundation for conservation in namibia .PERIOD <BREAK>
these are happy vocalizations .PERIOD <BREAK>
so the evolution of this -- i gather this isn't your first pendulum .PERIOD <BREAK>
these were money taken out in suitcases or in containers ,COMMA in cash of course .PERIOD <BREAK>
finally ,COMMA after about <NUM> years of alienating friends and strangers alike ,COMMA i finally got it ,COMMA a new personal truth all my own ,COMMA that if i was going to ever communicate well with other people the ideas that i was gaining ,COMMA i'd better find a different way of going about it .PERIOD <BREAK>

the south bronx ,COMMA which lies in between ,COMMA did not stand a chance .PERIOD <BREAK>
i mean ,COMMA here we're blowing wings off but the wing motor keeps all the way down .PERIOD <BREAK>

it is indeed ,COMMA but the ocean is liquid methane -- the temperature minus <NUM> degrees centigrade .PERIOD <BREAK>
so here's the situation .PERIOD <BREAK>
we're moving to this integration of biomedicine ,COMMA information technology ,COMMA wireless and ,COMMA i would say ,COMMA mobile now -- this era of digital medicine .PERIOD <BREAK>
so if you think about it ,COMMA these are really dramatically improving .PERIOD <BREAK>
i think it's sort of funny ;SEMICOLON it's on the siberian coast ,COMMA maybe the russians will charge tolls .PERIOD <BREAK>
the reason for that is that many people say you have to get rich first before you get few babies .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i think that's what i've always been interested in ,COMMA is that -- which is a personal kind of expression .PERIOD <BREAK>
the reason why the moon is huge on the horizon is simply because our perceptual bubble does not stretch out <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> kilometers .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i think if we reconnect to nature ,COMMA we'll be able to have the resources and that interest to solve these problems .PERIOD <BREAK>
that was what the conclusion of the dartmouth atlas of healthcare was about ,COMMA was saying that we can explain the geographic variations that occur in disease ,COMMA in illness ,COMMA in wellness ,COMMA and how our healthcare system actually operates .PERIOD <BREAK>

increasingly ,COMMA i would say explosive growth of technology .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's an important lesson for kids to understand -- that some of these laws get broken by accident and that laws have to be interpreted .PERIOD <BREAK>
but still ,COMMA if you're going to speak about a muslim culture ,COMMA this has a core ,COMMA the divine message ,COMMA which began the religion ,COMMA but then many traditions ,COMMA perceptions ,COMMA many practices were added on top of it .PERIOD <BREAK>
but as soon as it starts to flash -- and it's going to look big ,COMMA because it blooms on the camera -- i want you to look right here .PERIOD <BREAK>
it means that the economy is dividing into high-skill ,COMMA high-wage jobs and low-skill ,COMMA low-wage jobs -- and that the middle ,COMMA the middle-skill jobs ,COMMA and the middle-earning jobs ,COMMA are starting to drop out of the economy .PERIOD <BREAK>
and even blind babies smile to the sound of the human voice .PERIOD <BREAK>
and we can observe this .PERIOD <BREAK>
so we have companies and non-profits and charities and all these groups that have employees or volunteers of some sort .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the actual goal of the institution goes to two through n .PERIOD <BREAK>
the orbital refueling stations i've just described could create an entirely new industry and provide the final key for opening space to the general exploration .PERIOD <BREAK>
if you look at the interactions of a human brain ,COMMA as we heard yesterday from a number of presentations ,COMMA intelligence is wonderfully interactive .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so that maybe becomes part of the draw and part of the labyrinth .PERIOD <BREAK>
now ,COMMA chances are that over the last winter ,COMMA if you had been a beehive ,COMMA either you or one of the two people you just nodded at would have died .PERIOD <BREAK>
and we're a very young technology in an old galaxy ,COMMA and we don't yet know whether it's possible for technologies to persist .PERIOD <BREAK>

if you look at the number of tree species we have in europe ,COMMA for instance ,COMMA from the urals up to england ,COMMA you know how many ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
they were delighted ,COMMA and by the time it was time to go see the principal ,COMMA whom they'd actually come to see -- not the computer room -- they went upstairs and they said ,COMMA this is absolutely remarkable !EXCLAMATIONMARK <BREAK>

actually this creature is the result of the penfield research .PERIOD <BREAK>
and this is a burglar alarm .PERIOD <BREAK>

and so ,COMMA a lot of what has been done with people like danny hillis and others is to try to bring in engineering principles ,COMMA try to bring the software .PERIOD <BREAK>
and on april <NUM> th ,COMMA there will be step up day ,COMMA where there will be a thousand individual mobilized social activist movements in the united states on protest against legislation -- pushing for legislation to stop global warming .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so disseminating that information to around the rest of africa is important .PERIOD <BREAK>

what the f -- ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
that is the ground for mind training .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so i'm here standing on the shoulders of many people .PERIOD <BREAK>
what was actually interesting to us was not that the bacteria made light ,COMMA but when the bacteria made light .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so therefore whatever cultural variation there is in how human beings flourish can ,COMMA at least in principle ,COMMA be understood in the context of a maturing science of the mind -- neuroscience ,COMMA psychology ,COMMA etc .PERIOD <BREAK>
i came back after two months ,COMMA and the <NUM> children marched in looking very ,COMMA very quiet .PERIOD <BREAK>
we've tripled the miles that we drive since <NUM> and doubled them since <NUM> .PERIOD <BREAK>

at first it was pretty sensible .PERIOD we flew british airways to moscow .PERIOD <BREAK>
but so often ,COMMA they only get trained once ,COMMA so they're not aware of new medicines ,COMMA new guidelines as they come out .PERIOD <BREAK>
i don't know what kind of healthcare is delivered there .PERIOD <BREAK>
so i'm here to tell you that we have a problem with boys ,COMMA and it's a serious problem with boys .PERIOD <BREAK>
just flash it ,COMMA scare the guy .PERIOD he's a punk .PERIOD <BREAK>
for this to work ,COMMA this progress must be sustainable .PERIOD <BREAK>

i want to close by showing you a videotape that's a version of a future game in the rockett series that our graphic artists and design people put together ,COMMA that we feel would please that four percent of reviewers .PERIOD <BREAK>
but when you get your driving license ,COMMA you check the box if you do not want to donate your organ .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so ,COMMA you know ,COMMA <NUM> percent approval rating ain't so bad .PERIOD <BREAK>
you can see exactly how many of these types of items would fit in a room .PERIOD <BREAK>
i remember walking out of the theater and becoming suddenly aware of this fact ,COMMA as we walked hand in hand ,COMMA and pondering these very same questions .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is a little spot that we filmed there that's to be displayed on the large jumbotrons in singapore .PERIOD <BREAK>

the one i'm going to make is that it is time for us to reclaim what peace really means .PERIOD <BREAK>
the idea is that we really hate it when things go into the red .PERIOD <BREAK>
because we're going to need it if we're going to learn how to reconstruct towns .PERIOD <BREAK>
wake up .PERIOD <BREAK>
you've only got to say ,COMMA do you remember seeing lots of dragonflies .PERIOD <BREAK>
all these medications ,COMMA nothing seems to be working .PERIOD <BREAK>
the principle is you just need those three things -- variation ,COMMA selection and heredity .PERIOD <BREAK>
bill gates talked about the importance of education and ,COMMA in particular ,COMMA the model that kipp was providing :COLON knowledge is power .PERIOD <BREAK>
you cannot be constrained by the public's opinion .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is the kind of accuracy that i wanted ,COMMA and i replicated every last bone and put it in .PERIOD <BREAK>
and energy efficiency is more than just about the vehicle -- it's also about the road .PERIOD <BREAK>
what we need to think about perhaps for mission blue is increasing the biologging capacity .PERIOD <BREAK>
not because you force them to do something against their will ,COMMA but because they wanted to connect .PERIOD <BREAK>
these individuals are at specific risk ,COMMA particularly if there's blood contact ,COMMA they're at risk for transmission and possibly infection with novel viruses .PERIOD <BREAK>
just leave you with four golden rules ,COMMA for those of you who run businesses ,COMMA for commercial sound .PERIOD <BREAK>
well ,COMMA let's try to kill it with consumer electronics .PERIOD <BREAK>
let's give an example of where we think this is going to go .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA it should have happened about <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> years ago .PERIOD <BREAK>
the baby was delivered through a c-section ,COMMA but barbara suffered cerebral anoxia ,COMMA a loss of oxygen to the brain .PERIOD <BREAK>
so this is a single chromosome .PERIOD <BREAK>
when they're out pollinating or gathering pollen from one flower ,COMMA they stay to that crop exclusively ,COMMA in order to help generate .PERIOD <BREAK>
i grew up in a culture of self-effacement .PERIOD <BREAK>
thank you very much .PERIOD thank you very much .PERIOD <BREAK>
but some plants are manipulating animals ,COMMA like in the case of orchids that promise sex and nectar and give in change nothing for the transportation of the pollen .PERIOD <BREAK>
this was done by teruo okano at tokyo women's hospital .PERIOD <BREAK>
and once you make these ,COMMA you make a little house .PERIOD <BREAK>
and as we thought about it more ,COMMA we realized that it let you fill in all the details about the experience ,COMMA just as if you saw it on tv .PERIOD so ,COMMA for ted we decided to take our favorite idea for the gel magnet and work with roman and his team at the directors bureau to create a commercial for a product from the future .PERIOD <BREAK>
there is depth records ,COMMA where people go as deep as they can .PERIOD <BREAK>
and that's not the only thing that bad sound damages .PERIOD <BREAK>
now let me take you back as to why we needed to do it .PERIOD <BREAK>
so that when there was a sudden accidental discovery by one member of the group ,COMMA say the use of fire ,COMMA or a particular type of tool ,COMMA instead of dying out ,COMMA this spread rapidly ,COMMA horizontally across the population ,COMMA or was transmitted vertically ,COMMA down the generations .PERIOD <BREAK>
i'd collected -- i was a collector ,COMMA major ,COMMA big-time .PERIOD <BREAK>

what if from the women in africa who cannot sell any food -- there's no roads ,COMMA there's no warehouses ,COMMA there's not even a tarp to pick the food up with -- what if we give the enabling environment for them to provide the food to feed the hungry children elsewhere ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
i mean ,COMMA it must be true ,COMMA because we've had two hollywood blockbusters since that time ,COMMA and this paradigm ,COMMA from <NUM> to about <NUM> ,COMMA totally changed how we geologists thought about catastrophes .PERIOD <BREAK>
i built things in a time-graphics dimension .PERIOD <BREAK>
in order to do this ,COMMA we need to introduce new forces with new charge directions .PERIOD <BREAK>
and in particular ,COMMA i think we can learn things about learning .PERIOD <BREAK>
my name is ahmed .PERIOD i am an afghan refugee from the khyber agency .PERIOD <BREAK>
and you can see ,COMMA off a tiny film ,COMMA incredible clarity .PERIOD <BREAK>
but if they don't get <NUM> days ,COMMA they can fall into the ocean and die .PERIOD <BREAK>
if you can see this ,COMMA sweet peppers .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so we've done this actually on eight subjects now ,COMMA and we're just getting all the data together ,COMMA so hopefully we'll have something to say about it meaningfully .PERIOD <BREAK>
you can take a data set and put it there .PERIOD <BREAK>
but in fact ,COMMA if i were to place one base on each pixel of this <NUM> by <NUM> resolution screen ,COMMA we would need <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> screens to take a look at the genome .PERIOD <BREAK>
don't go asking for a frappuccino there .PERIOD <BREAK>

that is the tendency to infuse patterns with meaning ,COMMA intention and agency ,COMMA often invisible beings from the top down .PERIOD <BREAK>
what ?QUESTIONMARK did we do this ?QUESTIONMARK really ?QUESTIONMARK does anyone do this ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
there are ,COMMA of course ,COMMA more than those three projects that i'm showing here .PERIOD <BREAK>
so let's go back to haiti for a moment .PERIOD <BREAK>
but ,COMMA when you go to another linked data site -- and let's say this is one about travel ,COMMA and you say ,COMMA i want to send this photo to all the people in that group ,COMMA you can't get over the walls .PERIOD <BREAK>
i think they wanted to believe that the most expensive bottle of wine in the world must be the best bottle of wine in the world ,COMMA must be the rarest bottle of wine in the world .PERIOD <BREAK>

i've written about this idea before ,COMMA and i know there are people in this room who have expended significant effort on it in the past .PERIOD <BREAK>
they cross ,COMMA but ronald reagan ,COMMA a telegenic president ,COMMA is in office .PERIOD <BREAK>
now there's probably costs to calling louder or shifting the frequency away from where you want to be ,COMMA and there's probably lost opportunities .PERIOD <BREAK>
so throughout this talk i've mentioned a few times the special case of uganda ,COMMA and the fact that it's the only country in sub-saharan africa with successful prevention .PERIOD <BREAK>
let's look at some data from the u .PERIOD k .PERIOD now .PERIOD <BREAK>
and ultimately ,COMMA we have to try that .PERIOD <BREAK>
my father ,COMMA very inventive ,COMMA spatial thinker .PERIOD <BREAK>
and this is the bridge they're actually painting up and preparing as we speak .PERIOD <BREAK>
and if you say ,COMMA well ,COMMA but the guitar ,COMMA bass -- that's not so hot .PERIOD <BREAK>
it turns out ,COMMA all sorts of things .PERIOD <BREAK>
i want to talk now about errors in value .PERIOD <BREAK>
we just read the back of a label on a packet .PERIOD <BREAK>
i think the good news for me would be if we could go back and talk about the unleashing ,COMMA the continuation of the unleashing of human potential .PERIOD <BREAK>
and we can go and we can try to have pre-emptive preventive measures there .PERIOD <BREAK>
we do something to something and just like magic ,COMMA it moves .PERIOD the blob .PERIOD <BREAK>
what the entertainment business is struggling with ,COMMA the world of brands is figuring out .PERIOD <BREAK>
i'll give you some astounding things that have happened as we started this .PERIOD <BREAK>
and you've got to wage war here in such a way to facilitate that .PERIOD <BREAK>
there's all kinds of activity .PERIOD <BREAK>
we're not really accessing it .PERIOD and one of the reasons why i think that is ,COMMA is because -- we'll be helped by things like graphics and visualization and inference tools ,COMMA but i also think a big part of it is going to be starting to be able to have better interfaces ,COMMA to be able to drill down into this kind of data ,COMMA while still thinking about the big picture here .PERIOD <BREAK>
the suffering of indigenous peoples is not a simple issue to fix .PERIOD <BREAK>
there's much more in culture :COLON there's manuscripts ,COMMA there newspapers ,COMMA there's things that are not text ,COMMA like art and paintings .PERIOD <BREAK>

several studios are using this software now to produce virtual stuntmen ,COMMA and they're going to hit the screen quite soon ,COMMA actually ,COMMA for some major productions .PERIOD <BREAK>
and then they become tadpoles and frogs .PERIOD <BREAK>
if you looked at the buildings together with the associated transport ,COMMA in other words ,COMMA the transport of people ,COMMA which is <NUM> percent ,COMMA then <NUM> percent of the energy consumption is influenced by the way that our cites and infrastructure work together .PERIOD <BREAK>
and that's hard to -- that's hard to create -- but it is coming .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i just want to ,COMMA very quickly ,COMMA show you this .PERIOD <BREAK>

byte magazine and communications at the acm had special issues covering hypertext .PERIOD <BREAK>
nicole :COLON no .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's a completely empathic solution -- apart from the fact that teddy's probably not loving it .PERIOD <BREAK>

it is so important when we're communicating big ideas -- but especially a big spiritual idea like compassion -- to root it as we present it to others in space and time and flesh and blood -- the color and complexity of life .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's more like that .PERIOD <BREAK>
and yes ,COMMA the red planet is red .PERIOD <BREAK>
but let's just think through what the science is telling us is likely to happen .PERIOD <BREAK>
it follows a power law ,COMMA so that there are a few extremely well-linked to ,COMMA popular blogs ,COMMA and a long tail of blogs with very few links .PERIOD <BREAK>
the way we're going to run this -- we have no idea what we're going to discover .PERIOD <BREAK>
i would like to show you now some of the food that these welfare mothers do in this million dollar kitchen .PERIOD <BREAK>

there are three ways .PERIOD the main way is -- it's called dispositional .PERIOD <BREAK>
around the same time ,COMMA i was going through an audition -- the first ever open audition by national television in china -- with another thousand college girls .PERIOD <BREAK>

t :COLON most importantly .PERIOD s :COLON most importantly .PERIOD <BREAK>

it drives people from the smart part of the brain -- that dark ,COMMA deep well of the subconscious ,COMMA where instincts and experience ,COMMA and all the other factors of creativity and good judgment are -- it drives us to the thin veneer of conscious logic .PERIOD <BREAK>
we can influence behavior .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i think it's important that the individuals ,COMMA who are in that fortunate position ,COMMA do not end up competing for bigger and bigger boats ,COMMA and bigger and bigger cars ,COMMA but ,COMMA you know ,COMMA use that money to either create new jobs or to tackle issues around the world .PERIOD <BREAK>

and then the charges of treason were dropped .PERIOD <BREAK>
i love the brooklyn dodgers ,COMMA as you do ,COMMA but i promise you some day they will win fairly and squarely .PERIOD <BREAK>

well ,COMMA let's slip for a moment into the greatest culture sphere ever brought into being by the imagination ,COMMA that of polynesia .PERIOD <BREAK>
and of course ,COMMA there's an app for that .PERIOD <BREAK>
i can tell you indeed it is ,COMMA because this type of spectrum ,COMMA just like what you've seen in books ,COMMA and just like what you've seen in amino acids ,COMMA it doesn't really matter how you change the environment ,COMMA it's very robust ;SEMICOLON it's going to reflect the environment .PERIOD <BREAK>
so i'm here today to talk about the power of attention ,COMMA the power of your attention ,COMMA and the emergence and development of nonviolent movements in the west bank ,COMMA gaza and elsewhere -- but today ,COMMA my case study is going to be palestine .PERIOD <BREAK>

but he gave me a cup of tea .PERIOD <BREAK>
when i was four years old ,COMMA i have a vivid memory of finding two pinpoint scars on my ankle and asking my dad what they were .PERIOD <BREAK>
you learn things unconsciously .PERIOD <BREAK>
so i was an early reader ,COMMA and what i read were british and american children's books .PERIOD <BREAK>
it has to be companies .PERIOD it has to be civil society .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is playing with those filters .PERIOD <BREAK>
i went back to the states and started looking around to see if i could find examples where reverse fishing licenses had been issued ,COMMA and it turned out there were none .PERIOD <BREAK>
and howard is very interested in measuring things .PERIOD <BREAK>
so as you can guess ,COMMA my mother tongue is french .PERIOD <BREAK>
now ,COMMA for us environmentalists ,COMMA maybe the greenest thing about the cities is they diffuse the population bomb .PERIOD <BREAK>
he really meant it .PERIOD <BREAK>
so i asked for people's usernames and passwords to be sent to me .PERIOD <BREAK>

and not only that :COLON this dish is particularly popular after that holiday you call thanksgiving .PERIOD <BREAK>
they do ,COMMA like ,COMMA three years' retreat ,COMMA where they do meditate <NUM> hours a day .PERIOD <BREAK>
now ,COMMA the connection between biology and dna and life is very tantalizing when you talk about copernicus because ,COMMA even back then ,COMMA his followers very quickly made the logical step to ask :COLON if the earth is just a planet ,COMMA then what about planets around other stars ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
where are we ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
home cooking remained the norm ,COMMA but its quality was down the tubes .PERIOD <BREAK>
there will be a million unemployed young people here by the end of the year ,COMMA thousands losing their jobs everyday in america .PERIOD <BREAK>
boy :COLON about the second one .PERIOD <BREAK>
it forced him to be a little more innovative .PERIOD <BREAK>
and that means finding a way to do what they do without destroying the place that'll take care of their offspring .PERIOD <BREAK>
and we walked up this pathway ,COMMA all the way up .PERIOD <BREAK>
and as adults ,COMMA we're certainly not alone .PERIOD <BREAK>
at the same time ,COMMA all of our firepower was impotent when it came to halting or even stemming the slaughter in rwanda ,COMMA darfur ,COMMA myanmar .PERIOD <BREAK>
the second thing is ,COMMA the health issue .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the marketing is that not matter how much you've invested in your brand ,COMMA one bad week can undermine decades of good work .PERIOD <BREAK>
in fact ,COMMA it's hunky dory :COLON everything goes up .PERIOD <BREAK>
all right .PERIOD so i'm going to take a piece of chopin .PERIOD <BREAK>
the green line goes down .PERIOD that's the wild nature portion .PERIOD <BREAK>
when we act together ,COMMA the whole thing is much more than the sum of the parts .PERIOD <BREAK>
in switzerland ,COMMA back about <NUM> years ago ,COMMA they were trying to decide where to site nuclear waste dumps .PERIOD <BREAK>
we had deflation during the depression ,COMMA but that was collapse of the money supply ,COMMA collapse of consumer confidence ,COMMA a completely different phenomena .PERIOD <BREAK>
that's how you get rationality .PERIOD <BREAK>
when the rain comes down ,COMMA you can't hear a thing ,COMMA and in the summer it's about <NUM> degrees inside .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is the genetic biodiversity storehouse of corn .PERIOD <BREAK>
this kind of thing happens a lot .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA in the course of your vc pitch ,COMMA you have a very few minutes ,COMMA and most vc pitches -- most angel pitches are about <NUM> minutes ,COMMA most vc pitches should be less than half an hour .PERIOD <BREAK>
there are many ,COMMA many sites where warheads are stored and ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA lots of sites where fissionable materials ,COMMA like highly enriched uranium and plutonium ,COMMA are absolutely not safe .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's otherworldly ,COMMA beautiful .PERIOD <BREAK>
there isn't enough water .PERIOD <BREAK>

circle of fifths ,COMMA acoustic harmony ,COMMA geometric symmetry .PERIOD <BREAK>
for example ,COMMA cellulosic ethanol ,COMMA to power the entire u .PERIOD s .PERIOD vehicle fleet ,COMMA this is how much land you would need .PERIOD <BREAK>

do you have -- having been as physically involved in the site as you have been doing this project -- have any ideas about what should or shouldn't be done ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
e :COLON what's the matter ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
so ,COMMA it's a force that is the most powerful force that has been unleashed on this planet ,COMMA and in such a degree that i think that it's become our -- who we are .PERIOD <BREAK>
i witnessed the technical difficulty .PERIOD <BREAK>
my brother and i stepped out of the car .PERIOD <BREAK>
i get chills every time i see that .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's not secret .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is a typical insulin injection .PERIOD <BREAK>
i want to love and celebrate fiction for what it is ,COMMA not as a means to an end .PERIOD <BREAK>
and there are two billion children in the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
but let's swivel around and look at me frontally .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA what would happen if i showed up at a physics conference and said ,COMMA string theory is bogus .PERIOD <BREAK>
niall ,COMMA thank you .PERIOD <BREAK>
inflation ,COMMA in general ,COMMA is coming down across africa -- that's the first sign -- in many countries reaching double-digit figures .PERIOD <BREAK>
it seemed to be infinite .PERIOD <BREAK>
institutions only have two tools :COLON carrots and sticks .PERIOD <BREAK>
so literally ,COMMA you think about a rope .PERIOD it has very complex structure in the weave .PERIOD <BREAK>
and we could not find <NUM> girls in high school .PERIOD <BREAK>
one gram of cochineal costs about <NUM> euros .PERIOD <BREAK>
we know the children died .PERIOD <BREAK>
what would it be ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and it's the data hidden inside the recording .PERIOD <BREAK>
i did puzzles for bejeweled .PERIOD <BREAK>
we're really good at small numbers .PERIOD <BREAK>
that's what the sisters said ,COMMA he was fine .PERIOD <BREAK>
there's a potential problem that maybe this kind of shipping noise would prevent whales from being able to hear each other .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA cells have this cycle .PERIOD <BREAK>
so it's on legs ,COMMA so it focuses all the load on the masonry walls and the columns .PERIOD <BREAK>
fortunately ,COMMA necessity remains the mother of invention ,COMMA and a lot of the design work that we're the most proud of with the aircraft came out of solving the unique problems of operating it on the ground -- everything from a continuously-variable transmission and liquid-based cooling system that allows us to use an aircraft engine in stop-and-go traffic ,COMMA to a custom-designed gearbox that powers either the propeller when you're flying or the wheels on the ground ,COMMA to the automated wing-folding mechanism that we'll see in a moment ,COMMA to crash safety features .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i would think ,COMMA daddy ,COMMA how far does the universe go ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
never underestimate the power of food to turn a place around and make it a destination .PERIOD <BREAK>
maybe if i want to better relate to walls ,COMMA maybe i need to be more wall-like myself .PERIOD <BREAK>
and with al's blessing ,COMMA we decided on the spot to turn it into a film ,COMMA because we felt that we could get the message out there far more quickly than having al go around the world ,COMMA speaking to audiences of <NUM> or <NUM> at a time .PERIOD <BREAK>
and everybody's dogs at home have an autobiographical self to a certain degree .PERIOD <BREAK>
if we run the movie of our universe backwards ,COMMA we know that there was a big bang in our past ,COMMA and we might even hear the cacophonous sound of it ,COMMA but was our big bang the only big bang ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
it's just the poor people get hit first and worst .PERIOD <BREAK>
one is people need a guarantee they won't be evicted .PERIOD <BREAK>
then we tried it with my son ,COMMA dr .PERIOD tim fischell ,COMMA we tried it on some human patients who had to have a stent put in .PERIOD <BREAK>
we are the majority .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA these are all title pages that eventually led me to the solution i settled on ,COMMA which is the story of a young woman who sends a message on a homing pigeon -- she lives outside the walls of the city of rome -- to someone in the city .PERIOD <BREAK>
i think it comes from millions of years of holding that baby in front of your face ,COMMA cajoling it ,COMMA reprimanding it ,COMMA educating it with words .PERIOD <BREAK>
we don't know anything that eats it ,COMMA we're trying to do all sorts of genetics and figure out something that could be done ,COMMA but ,COMMA as it stands ,COMMA it's the monster from hell ,COMMA about which nobody knows what to do .PERIOD <BREAK>
oh ,COMMA the bottom of this box has electricity in here ,COMMA but this doesn't have electricity .PERIOD <BREAK>
and face-to-face groups are much smarter than groups that communicate electronically ,COMMA because <NUM> percent of our communication is non-verbal .PERIOD <BREAK>
who's pointing fingers ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
well it so happens that we have a singular body .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it's the same thing in looking at these questions of how things happen .PERIOD <BREAK>
but the science that's coming back from all of these laboratories about the use of this molecule has provided us insights that we might not have had on our own .PERIOD <BREAK>
and you're thinking ,COMMA my god ,COMMA these christians are coming to kill us .PERIOD <BREAK>
well what are we taking in ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
well ,COMMA to move data around from one place to another -- again ,COMMA it's not like a package courier .PERIOD <BREAK>
in fact ,COMMA our invention -- by our i mean we mammals -- one of our big inventions was the placenta .PERIOD <BREAK>
and september <NUM> th certainly taught us that that's a whole area we don't investigate .PERIOD <BREAK>
she grew up on a farm in austria ,COMMA very poor ,COMMA didn't have very much education .PERIOD <BREAK>
and we're going to be able to invent brain-based interventions for children who have difficulty learning .PERIOD <BREAK>
if you want to address a group ,COMMA you get the same message and you give it to everybody in the group ,COMMA whether you're doing that with a broadcasting tower or a printing press .PERIOD <BREAK>
and in that whole idea ,COMMA how do we configure the relationship between our body and the space ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
so what's needed is those organizations on the ground advocating for the democratic culture itself to create the demand on the ground for this culture .PERIOD <BREAK>
all of us are engaged in a seismic ,COMMA fundamental realignment of culture and communications ,COMMA a realignment that is shaking and decimating the newspaper industry ,COMMA the magazine industry ,COMMA the book and publishing industry and more .PERIOD <BREAK>
here's some reconstructions of some of the fossils that have been found from lake turkana .PERIOD <BREAK>
an almost-extinct animal from xochimilco ,COMMA mexico called an axolotl that can re-generate its limbs .PERIOD <BREAK>
you can't say ,COMMA here's the bad stuff .PERIOD <BREAK>
the average lottery buyer buys about <NUM> tickets a year ,COMMA so the buyer knows full well that he or she is going to lose ,COMMA and yet she buys <NUM> tickets a year .PERIOD why is that ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
i know that we have systematically annihilated the girl cell .PERIOD <BREAK>
we can actually click anything in universe and have it become the center of the universe ,COMMA and everything else will enter its orbit .PERIOD <BREAK>
we set up carpet-weaving units ,COMMA vocational training for the women .PERIOD <BREAK>
if it happens ,COMMA how bad do you think it will be ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
another thing that helped me as a little kid is ,COMMA boy ,COMMA in the ' <NUM> s ,COMMA you were taught manners .PERIOD <BREAK>
and this woman is the star of the video .PERIOD <BREAK>
francis crick ,COMMA the co-discoverer of the structure of dna with jim watson ,COMMA once joked about what he called orgel's second rule .PERIOD <BREAK>
these discoveries of behavioral markers ,COMMA and behavioral changes are game changing ,COMMA and like the discovery of the microscope because of our collecting data streams that we've actually never done before .PERIOD <BREAK>
instead ,COMMA what we saw is a lot of people who cheat a little bit .PERIOD <BREAK>
we've made a donation on everybody's behalf here to kick start ,COMMA no pun intended ,COMMA their next project .PERIOD <BREAK>
the cube can swivel ,COMMA or flip on its side ,COMMA and we just throw <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> of these cubes into a soup -- this is in simulation --and don't reward them for anything ,COMMA we just let them flip .PERIOD we pump energy into this and see what happens in a couple of mutations .PERIOD <BREAK>
i showed some of it at earlier teds before ,COMMA under the title things i've learned in my life so far .PERIOD <BREAK>
now ,COMMA each one of them is thinking ,COMMA i don't really want to kill that guy ,COMMA but he's about to kill me .PERIOD <BREAK>
five kids had emotional breakdowns .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i think inspired by that memory ,COMMA it's been my desire to try and bring it to as many other people as i can ,COMMA sort of pass it on through whatever means .PERIOD <BREAK>
even worse is when it finds its way into our natural environment -- on the side of the road or next to a river .PERIOD <BREAK>
rwanda in the immediate aftermath of the genocide was <NUM> percent female .PERIOD <BREAK>
they've come together .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's a shocking truth that we only see mirror images of ourselves ,COMMA and we only see ourselves in freeze-frame photographic images that capture a mere fraction of the time that we live .PERIOD <BREAK>
and that was to recognize that when you sit around the table ,COMMA the actual location of the people becomes rather important .PERIOD <BREAK>
i'm going to talk about the effect of the iphone .PERIOD <BREAK>
rockett :COLON hi miko !EXCLAMATIONMARK what's going on ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
tom ,COMMA thank you so much .PERIOD it's been really ,COMMA really great .PERIOD <BREAK>
in addition to cutaways ,COMMA we also explain physics .PERIOD <BREAK>
i've been so impressed by the kindness expressed to me .PERIOD <BREAK>
if the government's fiscal survival depends on it having to raise money from its own people ,COMMA such a government is driven by self-interest to govern in a more enlightened fashion .PERIOD <BREAK>
inanimate objects that might spontaneously synchronize themselves .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's a really important problem .PERIOD <BREAK>
but it goes down below ground many stories .PERIOD <BREAK>
his employees are inspired by the effort .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the total of direct tort cost in this country is about two percent ,COMMA which is twice as much as in other countries but ,COMMA as taxes go ,COMMA hardly crippling .PERIOD <BREAK>
i'd never seen the reef here before .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it actually -- so technologically ,COMMA it works .PERIOD <BREAK>
we urgently need to change this .PERIOD <BREAK>
be easier to find us at night .PERIOD <BREAK>
i believe the government should do more ,COMMA but nevertheless ,COMMA the direction it is moving in is the right direction .PERIOD <BREAK>
and there's no such thing as a <NUM> percent natural experience .PERIOD <BREAK>
friction climbing doesn't have any sort of hard positive edges .PERIOD <BREAK>
and when noah had done built his ark .PERIOD <BREAK>
why the limits to the movement ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>

we have every road ,COMMA every village ,COMMA every ,COMMA almost ,COMMA square inch of madagascar .PERIOD <BREAK>
i believe it will be referred to as a revolution ,COMMA so to speak -- when society ,COMMA faced with great challenges ,COMMA made a seismic shift from individual getting and spending towards a rediscovery of collective good .PERIOD <BREAK>
for example ,COMMA you know ,COMMA in new orleans we have cajun chinese food ,COMMA where they serve sichuan alligator and sweet and sour crawfish ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
in developing countries ,COMMA the most common mode of transportation is the railways ,COMMA and the british built a lot of railways in india .PERIOD <BREAK>

you can't farm the same piece of ground for <NUM> centuries without understanding nutrient flow .PERIOD <BREAK>
let's slow it down and you can see the spines in action .PERIOD <BREAK>
how do the rules give rise to the patterns ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
so ,COMMA we deserve just as much to be part of the exchange of ideas as everybody else .PERIOD <BREAK>
there is italian chinese food ,COMMA where they don't have fortune cookies ,COMMA so they serve fried gelato .PERIOD <BREAK>
that can't keep going on ,COMMA because economic incentives and disincentives are very powerful .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i was up in san francisco a while ago doing a book signing .PERIOD <BREAK>
how was the bible written ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
i don't think so .PERIOD <BREAK>
so if you saw them contract a germ or a piece of information ,COMMA you would know that ,COMMA soon enough ,COMMA everybody was about to contract this germ or this piece of information .PERIOD <BREAK>
and that material then we take back to the lab and analyze it .PERIOD <BREAK>
power is simple the ability to affect others to get the outcomes you want ,COMMA and you can do it in three ways .PERIOD <BREAK>
oh ,COMMA this is a little pony ,COMMA little pony -- very cute little thing .PERIOD <BREAK>
and finally ,COMMA i'd like to leave you with a glimpse that takes us back to the world of imagery .PERIOD <BREAK>
here's what i was saying about the laws .PERIOD they're really there .PERIOD <BREAK>
you may know this from the media ,COMMA but what you may not know is that the average age of the afghan people is <NUM> years old ,COMMA which means they grow up in such an environment and -- i repeat myself -- in <NUM> years of war .PERIOD <BREAK>
so it's got hybrid drive .PERIOD <BREAK>
in games and virtual worlds ,COMMA for example ,COMMA your facial expressions can naturally and intuitively be used to control an avatar or virtual character .PERIOD <BREAK>
here it is on the top of the building with plenty of windows to let light in .PERIOD <BREAK>
by the way ,COMMA i do make it look a little bit easier than it is .PERIOD <BREAK>
if we succeed ,COMMA what will molecular programming look like ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
we found activity in the brain region ,COMMA in exactly the same brain region associated with intense romantic love .PERIOD <BREAK>
now ,COMMA here is -- here is a representative quote from a besieged mother :COLON i'm overwhelmed with parenting advice .PERIOD <BREAK>
and there's this reference to le petit prince where the narrator asks the prince to draw a sheep .PERIOD <BREAK>
ok .PERIOD now ,COMMA steve ,COMMA i'm going to stand in front of the table ,COMMA ok .PERIOD when i stand in front of the table ,COMMA i want you to put the cups on the plinths ,COMMA like this ,COMMA in any order you want ,COMMA and then mix them all up ,COMMA so nobody has any idea where the spike is ,COMMA all right ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
he had a good laugh at the other teachers and put it up on the notice board .PERIOD <BREAK>
i'm not sure this is an improvement ,COMMA or a good idea ,COMMA because ,COMMA like ,COMMA if you don't spend quite enough time in front of your computer ,COMMA you can now get a plate in the keyboard ,COMMA so there's no more faking it -- that you don't really sit at your desk all day and eat and work anyway .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i'd be wrong to dis that completely .PERIOD <BREAK>
so i'll end with the new version .PERIOD <BREAK>
so if we're seriously talking about tackling climate change on an urbanizing planet ,COMMA we need to look somewhere else for the solution .PERIOD <BREAK>
i want to thank you for inviting me here .PERIOD <BREAK>
so who are these scientists and engineers at a magical place called darpa ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
after surgery ,COMMA everything normalizes .PERIOD <BREAK>
and pick the two best places -- the one where you didn't need any range extension .PERIOD <BREAK>
what happens in the after independence ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and the second is ,COMMA is it possible ,COMMA or even desirable ,COMMA to slow down ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and someone from this side of the room got up and said ,COMMA mr .PERIOD gates ,COMMA we have here as our goal in saudi arabia to be one of the top <NUM> countries when it comes to technology .PERIOD <BREAK>
these are the results of the hard problem i gave you :COLON <NUM> now or <NUM> in a month ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
we've seen people ,COMMA even today ,COMMA speaking to us about aids epidemics and starving kids around the world and impure water supplies that people have to suffer with .PERIOD <BREAK>
why ?QUESTIONMARK because the soul ,COMMA the human soul ,COMMA embodies a piece of the divine breath ,COMMA a piece of the divine soul .PERIOD <BREAK>
upper left is a film they did on toy trains .PERIOD <BREAK>
so you can see here on the vertical axis ,COMMA i haven't shown it all the way down to zero ,COMMA there are lots of other options ,COMMA but here i'm just showing you the prediction ,COMMA so i've narrowed the scale .PERIOD <BREAK>
and that sugar dough ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
so you know those packing slips you get on your fedex boxes ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
this is the frontispiece of his book utopia .PERIOD <BREAK>
i think nothing good will come out of that .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i was getting it all on film and i was recording it ,COMMA and i was thinking ,COMMA this is it .PERIOD this is the possibility of it maybe working .PERIOD <BREAK>
or you might look in an older individual who has mastered a complex set of abilities that might relate to reading musical notation or performing the mechanical acts of performance that apply to musical performance .PERIOD <BREAK>
yeah .PERIOD i'm still thinking to work on energy .PERIOD <BREAK>
you had a monopoly supplier .PERIOD on the left ,COMMA you have rupert murdoch ,COMMA or the bbc .PERIOD <BREAK>
i came up with this idea :COLON a life of bits and pieces ,COMMA which i'm just starting to work on -- my next project .PERIOD <BREAK>
not in the middle east .PERIOD <BREAK>
everybody could go and listen ,COMMA you know -- ordinary people ,COMMA even the sultan ,COMMA muslims and non-muslims .PERIOD <BREAK>
but i was happy to pay it ,COMMA because for every blow that i received ,COMMA i was able to deliver two .PERIOD <BREAK>
<NUM> :COLON the great lakota warrior and chief named crazy horse surrendered at fort robinson .PERIOD <BREAK>
that's puff pastry day .PERIOD why ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and you interact a lot with your neighbors -- people you like ,COMMA people you might not know .PERIOD <BREAK>
and they are .PERIOD so let me start with the second one :COLON typical .PERIOD well -- is this a typical place ?QUESTIONMARK well ,COMMA let's look around ,COMMA you know ,COMMA and look in a random direction ,COMMA and we see a wall ,COMMA and chemical scum -- -- and that's not typical of the universe at all .PERIOD <BREAK>
found one of his dirigibles that had enough dimensions so i could actually use it as a scale that i would then juxtapose with some of the things in rome .PERIOD <BREAK>
their other name ,COMMA mola mola ,COMMA is -- it sounds hawaiian ,COMMA but it's actually latin for millstone ,COMMA and that's attributable to their roundish ,COMMA very bizarre ,COMMA cut-off shape .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it was so beautiful that i've been back there ever since ,COMMA for the last seven years .PERIOD <BREAK>
so this is one of the biggest molecular structures that you have ,COMMA at least as far as we've discovered so far inside of us .PERIOD <BREAK>
well ,COMMA when we look out ,COMMA you and i ,COMMA over that canopy of the intact primary forest ,COMMA what we see is this enormous carpet of carbon .PERIOD <BREAK>
the good news is random people apparate from nowhere ,COMMA put out the fire and leave without expecting payment or praise .PERIOD <BREAK>
here's a man announcing the new market watch from dow jones ,COMMA powered <NUM> percent by the user experience on the home page -- user-generated content married up with traditional content .PERIOD <BREAK>
so i made series of images ,COMMA cuttings ,COMMA and i assembled them in portfolios .PERIOD <BREAK>
it'll have an intelligence in there ,COMMA that's not ,COMMA again ,COMMA conscious .PERIOD <BREAK>
i know the day ,COMMA i know who i am ,COMMA i know you're presenting .PERIOD <BREAK>
once you tell me you would like to save more in the future ,COMMA let's say every january you're going to be saving more automatically and it's going to go away from your paycheck to the <NUM> plan before you see it ,COMMA before you touch it ,COMMA before you get the issue of immediate gratification .PERIOD <BREAK>
we needed new boundaries to describe our traditional lands ;SEMICOLON we needed to learn more things like gps just to see whether -- can gps really reflect the true reflection of the land or is this just a thing made somewhere in the west ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
it doesn't work .PERIOD <BREAK>
so it's not simply looking at the quality or ,COMMA if you will ,COMMA the luxury of that interface ,COMMA but it's actually looking at the idea of presenting things that previously couldn't be presented before .PERIOD <BREAK>
the reason i quantify that is because we really embarked on this as a mutual journey to really get inside of it .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so it's been tectonically altered .PERIOD <BREAK>
if you know of photographers ,COMMA the joke is it's the finest form of delayed adolescence ever invented .PERIOD <BREAK>
in a hospital ,COMMA this device could be used to carry around medical equipment .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it's economic empowerment and the ability for a woman to say ,COMMA i am as much contributing to this family ,COMMA or more ,COMMA than you are .PERIOD <BREAK>
the second ,COMMA or a different kind of remoteness is that within the large metropolitan areas all over the world ,COMMA you have pockets ,COMMA like slums ,COMMA or shantytowns ,COMMA or poorer areas ,COMMA which are socially and economically remote from the rest of the city ,COMMA so it's us and them .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it wasn't just to that wine .PERIOD <BREAK>
so i did .PERIOD that's paris .PERIOD <BREAK>
kbi :COLON i'm just telling her to make sure she places it well so that it won't affect my face -- the explosion ,COMMA you know .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA the science is changing .PERIOD <BREAK>
so as food became more plentiful ,COMMA bread became cheaper .PERIOD <BREAK>
these were money taken out by criminals and money launderers .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so here's the periodic table .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i found that there were ways to duplicate the same approach that i used to use on the airplane .PERIOD <BREAK>
and afterwards we convened at the president's house with dr .PERIOD robicsek on one hand ,COMMA mr .PERIOD milliken on the other .PERIOD <BREAK>
stuck in traffic .PERIOD i'll be there soon .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so then the object -- the merchandise that you're interested in -- can be scanned .PERIOD it's taken into the dressing room ,COMMA and in the dressing room there are scanners so that we know exactly what clothing you have in the dressing room .PERIOD <BREAK>
and because <NUM> percent of what we put in the tool become the final product ,COMMA even the parts that aren't digested become part of the structure ,COMMA we're getting incredible yield rates .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's just that it doesn't explain anything .PERIOD <BREAK>
we should be celebrating play .PERIOD <BREAK>
and what's the second most important thing after integrity ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and i borrowed these three ipods from people here in the audience to show you what i mean .PERIOD <BREAK>
i tell you ,COMMA it was something so sinister that i was astonished he could do it every day .PERIOD <BREAK>
but with synthetic biology ,COMMA we can actually imagine engineering this bacterium to produce something that gives us the quality ,COMMA quantity and shape of material that we desire .PERIOD <BREAK>
the lowest number of combatant casualties occurred in <NUM> ,COMMA with just <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> killed .PERIOD <BREAK>
they've got every feature known to man in there ,COMMA because adding a new feature is just software .PERIOD <BREAK>
as long as it's fun and it seems like it's going to be a funny idea and it seems like the people who witness it will also have a fun time ,COMMA then that's enough for us .PERIOD <BREAK>
for example ,COMMA i took a whole bunch of fortune cookies back to china ,COMMA gave them to chinese to see how they would react .PERIOD <BREAK>
battelle laboratories and i joined up in bellingham ,COMMA washington .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's not about them ,COMMA they know that ,COMMA but it has to start with them .PERIOD <BREAK>

but since we ate all the oysters and we ate all the fish that would eat the plankton ,COMMA there's nothing to eat the plankton and there's more and more of it ,COMMA so it dies of old age ,COMMA which is unheard of for plankton .PERIOD <BREAK>
your value is not based on your valuables ;SEMICOLON it's based on a whole different set of things .PERIOD <BREAK>
the point is that you can find ukrainian folk dancers and connect with them ,COMMA because you want to be connected .PERIOD <BREAK>
it seems incredible in the past .PERIOD in the future ,COMMA it'll seem incredible what we are doing today .PERIOD and so i've been trying to develop a hierarchical set of considerations about why societies fail to solve their problems -- why they fail to perceive the problems or ,COMMA if they perceive them ,COMMA why they fail to tackle them .PERIOD or ,COMMA if they tackle them ,COMMA why do they fail to succeed in solving them ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
there's a big array of the ways of dealing with this .PERIOD <BREAK>
when i look back now from this high hill of my old age ,COMMA i can still see the butchered women and children lying heaped and scattered all along the crooked gulch as plain as when i saw them with eyes still young .PERIOD <BREAK>
so again ,COMMA we're sent back to the idea of ultra-precise control .PERIOD <BREAK>
i got the chinese line .PERIOD <BREAK>
there are no prizes for telling us what the problems are ,COMMA are there ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
so the fact that not only did cancer not seem to originate in skeletal muscles ,COMMA but cancer didn't seem to go to skeletal muscle -- there seemed to be something here .PERIOD <BREAK>
i'm a cancer doctor ,COMMA and i walked out of my office and walked by the pharmacy in the hospital three or four years ago ,COMMA and this was the cover of fortune magazine sitting in the window of the pharmacy .PERIOD <BREAK>

my wife pointed out to me that it will work better if i put both on at the same time because otherwise the whole thing will tip over .PERIOD <BREAK>

being able to treat sound as an instrument ,COMMA and be able to dig for more abstract sounds and things to play live ,COMMA mixing electronics and acoustics .PERIOD <BREAK>
you have to be generous ,COMMA and your hearts must be generous ,COMMA your mind must be generous .PERIOD <BREAK>
the transition will be this one .PERIOD <BREAK>
we're either going to have an absolutely unmitigated catastrophe of this oil leak in the gulf ,COMMA or we will make the moment we need out of this ,COMMA as many people have noted today .PERIOD <BREAK>
and angel investors in america put in money into that .PERIOD <BREAK>
okay ,COMMA try this .PERIOD bring it back .PERIOD <BREAK>
so let me now apply this to a current controversy ,COMMA not because i want to advocate any particular solution ,COMMA but just to illustrate the kind of thing i mean .PERIOD <BREAK>
ma'am ,COMMA did you know that was a light you just ran ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and those moms bought and prepared food .PERIOD <BREAK>
and they all seemed to be ok .PERIOD <BREAK>
i mean that we evolved to see sacredness all around us and to join with others into teams and circle around sacred objects ,COMMA people and ideas .PERIOD <BREAK>
so you have these three mysteries .PERIOD <BREAK>
and if they collide ,COMMA it would look a lot like the big bang .PERIOD <BREAK>
and how do you bring those two things together ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
it's a promise .PERIOD <BREAK>
china held a huge advantage in terms of human capital vis-a-vis india .PERIOD <BREAK>
then these labs started doing serious problem solving -- instrumentation for agriculture in india ,COMMA steam turbines for energy conversion in ghana ,COMMA high-gain antennas in thin client computers .PERIOD <BREAK>
nor did he tell us ,COMMA trust us .PERIOD trust your country .PERIOD <BREAK>

first of all ,COMMA i must ,COMMA as a speaker ,COMMA provide a service to the audience and talk about what i will give you ,COMMA instead of saying what i can't have .PERIOD <BREAK>
and this is all about darkness as much as it is about lightness ,COMMA of course ,COMMA because otherwise you don't see these dynamics .PERIOD <BREAK>
but i think ,COMMA as a community ,COMMA we still have a lot to learn .PERIOD <BREAK>
the goal is not to turn kids into your kind of adult ,COMMA but rather better adults than you have been ,COMMA which may be a little challenging considering your guys' credentials .PERIOD <BREAK>
all right ,COMMA what's the consequence ?QUESTIONMARK the oceans probably turn purple .PERIOD <BREAK>
so first i'm going to show you the three-year-old again .PERIOD <BREAK>
through haiti rewired ,COMMA through build change ,COMMA architecture for humanity ,COMMA aidg ,COMMA there is the possibility to reach out to <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> -- <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> masons across the country and create a movement of proper building .PERIOD <BREAK>

that's good .PERIOD <BREAK>
i was given the clothes that i needed to wear and told where i needed to be ,COMMA given these very precious and holy looking robes to wear ,COMMA with the understanding that it was something sacred or important .PERIOD <BREAK>
an emotion ,COMMA then ,COMMA creates what we're going to do or the action .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it's probably the most intense kind of territory of the work ,COMMA which is not occupied ,COMMA because architecture is always the most interesting in some mechanism when it's separated from function ,COMMA and this is an area that allows for that .PERIOD <BREAK>
i'm a good provider ,COMMA too .PERIOD <BREAK>
let me give you some examples .PERIOD <BREAK>
because old and ancient as it may be ,COMMA it's very complicated and it's very simple ,COMMA both at the same time .PERIOD <BREAK>
and we're seeing people transform their lives .PERIOD <BREAK>
i thank you for your attention .PERIOD <BREAK>
now after sporulation ,COMMA the spores repel .PERIOD <BREAK>

we can think them out .PERIOD we can create incredible things .PERIOD <BREAK>
this group uses three ,COMMA one each .PERIOD <BREAK>

so ,COMMA the four-wheel drive vehicles at the headquarters drive the ministers ,COMMA the permanent secretaries ,COMMA the bureaucrats and the international aid bureaucrats who work in aid projects ,COMMA while the poor die without ambulances and medicine .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the idea behind this is to do the perfect job doing search ,COMMA you really have to be smart .PERIOD <BREAK>
next ,COMMA we need proper science ,COMMA proper evidence .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the second thing ,COMMA i think ,COMMA is that the world needs to have people in charge of that .PERIOD <BREAK>
and again ,COMMA the way in which that works as a building ,COMMA for those of us who can enjoy the spaces ,COMMA to live and visit there .PERIOD <BREAK>
now ,COMMA until <NUM> - <NUM> ,COMMA the bulk of all this money flew into the u .PERIOD s .PERIOD economy because the bulk of the money was denominated in u .PERIOD s .PERIOD dollars and the money laundering was taking place inside the united states .PERIOD <BREAK>
but more importantly ,COMMA it saves lives .PERIOD <BREAK>
now ,COMMA i agree that you have to -- yeah ,COMMA there are certain concessions and ,COMMA you know ,COMMA if you use a slide projector ,COMMA you're not able to have the bad type swing in from the back or the side ,COMMA or up or down ,COMMA but maybe that's an o .PERIOD k .PERIOD trade-off ,COMMA to trade that off for a focus .PERIOD <BREAK>
heaven forbid they play in the dirt ,COMMA the kal ,COMMA or even worse ,COMMA lokvi ,COMMA water -- that will kill them .PERIOD <BREAK>
one nation ,COMMA one system .PERIOD <BREAK>

what a moron .PERIOD <BREAK>
audience :COLON itay talgam :COLON good .PERIOD now like a karajan .PERIOD since you're already trained ,COMMA let me concentrate ,COMMA close my eyes .PERIOD come ,COMMA come .PERIOD <BREAK>
now scanning a book is like taking a digital photograph of every page of the book .PERIOD <BREAK>
we have the androids that are inspired by man .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA the program that we're involved in is something which we call diagnostics for all ,COMMA or zero-cost diagnostics .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i was a guinea pig ,COMMA as i hope to continue to be in every new form of prosthetic limbs that come out .PERIOD <BREAK>
a long time ago ,COMMA back in the early <NUM> s ,COMMA museums were out looking for dinosaurs .PERIOD <BREAK>
but isotopes ,COMMA particles of electricity ,COMMA antimatter ,COMMA neutrinos ,COMMA the conversion of mass to energy -- that's e=mc^ <NUM> -- gamma rays ,COMMA transmutation .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so ,COMMA he wrote an op-ed piece in the guardian about katie's song ,COMMA in which he said ,COMMA well ,COMMA we know exactly how old ,COMMA how far from the edge .PERIOD <BREAK>
you might think of that as the privatization of war .PERIOD <BREAK>
therefore we need to create a new set of labor laws ,COMMA which are not as onerous as they are today .PERIOD <BREAK>
the second plant is mother-in-law's tongue ,COMMA which is again a very common plant ,COMMA and we call it a bedroom plant ,COMMA because it converts co <NUM> into oxygen at night .PERIOD <BREAK>
and then in paintbrushes ,COMMA hairs are used because ,COMMA apparently ,COMMA they're very suitable for making paintbrushes because of their hard-wearing nature .PERIOD <BREAK>
this woman is nine ,COMMA which means grandma in turkish .PERIOD <BREAK>
one of the things that i'm really ,COMMA really happy to be able to show you here today is our virtual autopsy table .PERIOD <BREAK>
some of these organizations don't even have the united states as a member .PERIOD <BREAK>
a couple of years ago ,COMMA i was in new york ,COMMA and i was pitching a deal ,COMMA and i was in one of those fancy new york private equity offices you can picture .PERIOD <BREAK>
alright what about problems ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
so in such a relational universe ,COMMA if you come upon something that’s ordered and structured ,COMMA like this device here ,COMMA or that device there ,COMMA or something beautiful ,COMMA like all the living things ,COMMA all of you guys in the room -- guys in physics ,COMMA by the way ,COMMA is a generic term :COLON men and women .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is all real .PERIOD so why don't we go ahead and start those pictures .PERIOD <BREAK>
fifteen percent suffer migraines that wipe them out for days on end .PERIOD <BREAK>
the bone histology tells us that edmontosaurus is a juvenile ,COMMA or at least a sub-adult ,COMMA and the other one is an adult and we have an ontogeny .PERIOD <BREAK>
how do we self-identify and how mutable is that identity ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
it wasn't until years later ,COMMA looking back on this whole age-of-reason/change-of-birthday thing ,COMMA that it dawned on me :COLON i wasn't turning seven when i thought i turned seven .PERIOD i had a whole other month to do anything i wanted to before god started keeping tabs on me .PERIOD <BREAK>
it doesn't see any excess cost .PERIOD it doesn't spend any extra time .PERIOD <BREAK>
i notice this stuff because i walk a lot ,COMMA but here ,COMMA private industry is really kind of making a mess of the public sector .PERIOD <BREAK>
the poor puppy jumps up ,COMMA you open the dog book ,COMMA what does it say ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and as i read that ,COMMA i looked at it ,COMMA and i thought ,COMMA you know ,COMMA what this is saying is that the purpose of influence is to speak up for those who have no influence .PERIOD <BREAK>
now over the last couple of years ,COMMA we've gone back to the tree of life because we wanted to find ways to turn circuits in the brain off .PERIOD <BREAK>
not a dictionary ,COMMA or dictionaries .PERIOD and that's because ,COMMA well ,COMMA people use the dictionary to stand for the whole language .PERIOD <BREAK>
but she did it all on her own .PERIOD <BREAK>
now -- the story might seem to good to be true ,COMMA but when you administer batteries of psychological tests ,COMMA you get the same results -- namely ,COMMA identical twins separated at birth show quite astonishing similarities .PERIOD <BREAK>
and everyone kind of sat at the table .PERIOD <BREAK>
so i want to thank you for being here and i want to end this in five seconds of silence .PERIOD <BREAK>
my shame as a spur ,COMMA i fled the abyss .PERIOD <BREAK>
it may be good technology ,COMMA but i feel like there's not enough of a support structure .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's about <NUM> degrees outside .PERIOD <BREAK>
and for that reason ,COMMA we cover the led with a phosphor cap .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA he was very satisfied with the kind of relationship they had over <NUM> years .PERIOD <BREAK>
but there's also the fear of losing loved ones ,COMMA and i think that's even worse .PERIOD <BREAK>
and he's right .PERIOD this is a problem .PERIOD <BREAK>
how are people supposed to have any kind of common understanding or know how to move together into the future ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
they're not going to use them ,COMMA or at least they're not going to use them as bed nets ,COMMA maybe as fishing nets .PERIOD <BREAK>
yes .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i've always believed that the act of architecture ,COMMA even a private house ,COMMA when somebody else will see it ,COMMA is a political act ,COMMA because it will be visible to others .PERIOD <BREAK>
so there he is with his little laptop computer ,COMMA but fighting against the might of the pressures -- because of the debt ,COMMA the foreign debt of ecuador -- fighting the pressure of world bank ,COMMA imf ,COMMA and of course the people who want to exploit the forests and take out the oil .PERIOD <BREAK>
this shows the power of incentives .PERIOD <BREAK>
there were hypertext comics .PERIOD <BREAK>
others work through the instrument of money .PERIOD <BREAK>
and that's what we've done ,COMMA because we're all working for each other .PERIOD <BREAK>
and how can light help there ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
i photographed him at the scene of the crime at the snake river in idaho .PERIOD <BREAK>
but the one thing i definitely didn't want to do with this coverage was to continue to portray sharks as something like monsters .PERIOD <BREAK>
these rapid collapses are especially likely where there's a mismatch between available resources and resource consumption ,COMMA or a mismatch between economic outlays and economic potential .PERIOD <BREAK>
what do they do ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
it turns out that these long-lived mutants are more resistant to all these diseases .PERIOD <BREAK>
she is traveling because she was out of the country at the time of the elections .PERIOD <BREAK>
here's a wonderful fractal .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's a falcon .PERIOD it's called the eastern red-footed falcon ,COMMA obviously .PERIOD <BREAK>
so a few days after that ,COMMA what happens ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
there is a particular way of knowing .PERIOD <BREAK>
one is called reln -- it's involved in early developmental cues .PERIOD <BREAK>
i did use that during these last <NUM> years about <NUM> times -- never with that type of wing ,COMMA but at the beginning .PERIOD <BREAK>

we found activity in a tiny ,COMMA little factory near the base of the brain called the ventral tegmental area .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's the revitalization of the river rouge in dearborn .PERIOD <BREAK>
no .PERIOD it was retreating through the winter because it's an unhealthy glacier .PERIOD <BREAK>
so we started exploring this material called etfe .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's an online music video for the arcade fire .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the second implication is that the world will inevitably ,COMMA as a consequence ,COMMA become increasingly unfamiliar to us ,COMMA because it'll be shaped by cultures and experiences and histories that we are not really familiar with ,COMMA or conversant with .PERIOD <BREAK>
the u .PERIOD s .PERIOD library of congress ,COMMA in terms of its printed volume of data ,COMMA contains less data than is coming out of a good genomics company every month on a compound basis .PERIOD <BREAK>
only one state says they don't have to balance the budget .PERIOD <BREAK>
and their wish would then be brought to a priest ,COMMA who would find a ritual object ,COMMA and the appropriate sacrifices would be made ,COMMA and the shrine would be built for the god .PERIOD <BREAK>
but maybe me ,COMMA i give out something better because i give them hope .PERIOD <BREAK>
physical therapies can be done ,COMMA not only in the orthopedic center ,COMMA but also in the houses of the people .PERIOD <BREAK>
you might have a guess .PERIOD <BREAK>
and running gives me a lot of energy .PERIOD <BREAK>
i think the only point of similarity between us is we both like to talk about ourselves .PERIOD <BREAK>
here we have the description of the order of nature .PERIOD <BREAK>
what determines your resources ?QUESTIONMARK we've said decisions shape destiny ,COMMA which is my focus here .PERIOD if decisions shape destiny ,COMMA what determines it is three decisions .PERIOD what are you going to focus on ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
you see them on the mountains up there .PERIOD <BREAK>

and part of it is a personal story .PERIOD when chris invited me to speak ,COMMA he said ,COMMA people think of you as a bit of an enigma ,COMMA and they want to know what drives you a bit .PERIOD <BREAK>
i lived in new york city .PERIOD <BREAK>
and we discovered that they talk about the kids in their school ,COMMA who talk about gaming ,COMMA in pretty demeaning ways .PERIOD <BREAK>
you see ,COMMA it wasn't working very well .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is in technology .PERIOD this is in the area of politics ,COMMA where pundits ,COMMA the cia ,COMMA mi <NUM> always get it wrong .PERIOD <BREAK>
how would you talk ?QUESTIONMARK how would you be ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
he got a job working for raytheon ,COMMA designing guidance systems ,COMMA which was part of the route <NUM> high-tech axis in those days -- so the equivalent of silicone valley in the ' <NUM> s .PERIOD <BREAK>
in a pre-internet world ,COMMA sovereignty over our physical freedoms ,COMMA or lack thereof ,COMMA was controlled almost entirely by nation-states .PERIOD <BREAK>
and if you look closely at these ballot forms ,COMMA you'll notice that the candidate list is in a different order on each one .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so we studied the idea at harvard .PERIOD <BREAK>
they get no great pleasure from what they do .PERIOD <BREAK>
the traditional approach to space exploration has been that you carry all the fuel you need to get everybody back in case of an emergency .PERIOD <BREAK>
so this was filmed at <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> frames per second ,COMMA and i'm playing it back at <NUM> .PERIOD and so this is slowed down <NUM> times .PERIOD <BREAK>
second ,COMMA no doubt more familiar to you ,COMMA is the nature of modern american education :COLON scripted ,COMMA lock-step curricula .PERIOD <BREAK>
some of the highlights were things like the terminator ,COMMA aladdin ,COMMA the teenage mutant hero turtles .PERIOD <BREAK>
and we do know that in domestic animals and others ,COMMA when they're play deprived ,COMMA they don't -- and rats also -- they don't develop a brain that is normal .PERIOD <BREAK>
rebecca saxe :COLON this is the first pirate .PERIOD his name is ivan .PERIOD <BREAK>
which is a fantastic story ,COMMA unless you think about humanity's footprint on the planet and our ability to keep up food production .PERIOD <BREAK>
in fact ,COMMA if i cling to one memory of this year ,COMMA it would be walking down a darkened hallway with five spongy fingers grasping the handle underneath my hand .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's an interesting fact .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i still worked as a tour leader ,COMMA traveled back and forth in china ,COMMA tibet and central asia .PERIOD <BREAK>
and this really became the template for moving forward .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the farther you are away in distance ,COMMA the longer it is in time from the initial blast ;SEMICOLON and the more separation between you and the outside atmosphere ,COMMA the better .PERIOD <BREAK>
probably in a few years ,COMMA you'll check into your mirror and it's going to be diagnosing you .PERIOD <BREAK>
i'm always surprised the u .PERIOD s .PERIOD army sociologists are discussing of the impact for instance ,COMMA of soldiers in iraq having daily contact with their families .PERIOD <BREAK>
so last fall when we published the results of that work in science ,COMMA we all became overconfident and were sure we were only a few weeks away from being able to now boot up a chromosome out of yeast .PERIOD <BREAK>
well ,COMMA as an environmentalist ,COMMA we would rather that didn't happen .PERIOD <BREAK>
so two of them implanted in the body would weigh less than a dime .PERIOD <BREAK>
we have to understand why people are not saving ,COMMA and then we can hopefully flip the behavioral challenges into behavioral solutions ,COMMA and then see how powerful it might be .PERIOD <BREAK>
that's it .PERIOD that's really all you need to know .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the ship sinks ,COMMA and the captain has lost everything ,COMMA but for a life jacket .PERIOD <BREAK>
this really shows you ,COMMA we have not seen good economic and health progress anywhere in the world without destroying the climate .PERIOD <BREAK>
and that's a quite clever guy ,COMMA huh ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
so cate says ,COMMA shekhar ,COMMA what do you want me to do ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
that bothers me the most .PERIOD <BREAK>
when it has a scarce resource that it wants to turn into a desirable outcome ,COMMA it thinks in terms of efficiency .PERIOD <BREAK>
thank you .PERIOD <BREAK>
but we all know that that's bullshit at times .PERIOD <BREAK>
aid increases the resources available to governments ,COMMA and that makes working in a government the most profitable thing you can have ,COMMA as a person in africa seeking a career .PERIOD <BREAK>
because one of her favorite folks from back home is here ,COMMA and she's pretty nervous to meet him .PERIOD <BREAK>
they're transnational ,COMMA and they bond around these ideas and narratives and these symbols and these leaders .PERIOD <BREAK>
and when you look at emotional engagement ,COMMA it was completely different .PERIOD <BREAK>
today we face the scourge of terrorism .PERIOD <BREAK>
now the protectionism of argentine dance teachers aside ,COMMA i found this very interesting .PERIOD so i decided to focus on three of those commonalities .PERIOD <BREAK>
we perfect .PERIOD <BREAK>
and he would say ,COMMA listen ,COMMA i know i gave you that huge pill ,COMMA that complicated ,COMMA hard-to-swallow pill before ,COMMA but now i've got one that's so potent ,COMMA that is really tiny and small and almost invisible .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i hope you'll come with me on my basic premise that words matter ,COMMA that they shape the way we understand ourselves ,COMMA the way we interpret the world and the way we treat others .PERIOD <BREAK>
that wave is much larger ,COMMA much more powerful ,COMMA and that's of course the wave of technology .PERIOD <BREAK>
edith widder :COLON so i recorded that with an intensified video camera that has about the sensitivity of the fully dark-adapted human eye .PERIOD <BREAK>
i have a stake in these ,COMMA so i'll have a disclaimer there .PERIOD <BREAK>
over six million years ,COMMA we and the chimps evolved our different ways .PERIOD <BREAK>
decoration of the unfinished project is a kind of conceptual incubation .PERIOD <BREAK>
if medical science stopped seeking cures and concentrated on prevention only ,COMMA then it would achieve very little of either .PERIOD <BREAK>
those top-down schemes are alienating to just about everybody ,COMMA even if you mean well when you build them .PERIOD <BREAK>
the vast rural areas ,COMMA where <NUM> million people lived ,COMMA there were no telephones .PERIOD <BREAK>
and that is how this difference has come .PERIOD <BREAK>
and they had the reporters and their producers participate .PERIOD <BREAK>
and this picture shows the average activation in a group of what we call typical human adults .PERIOD <BREAK>
the year ,COMMA let's remember ,COMMA that this voice ,COMMA now departed ,COMMA first came a-cryin' into this big old crazy world of ours .PERIOD <BREAK>
now ,COMMA another couple of years ,COMMA and these animals will survive on their own .PERIOD <BREAK>
there are lots and lots of ways of measuring things -- weighing them and measuring their length -- but the metric system is winning .PERIOD <BREAK>
the art of storytelling has remained unchanged .PERIOD <BREAK>
there's none of the tiredness .PERIOD <BREAK>
collaborator six :COLON watching the video in my room ,COMMA i could see me not understanding at the beginning of it .PERIOD <BREAK>
you know what ?QUESTIONMARK six of those seven voted yes in favor of the bill ,COMMA so it passed ,COMMA and it passed by a vote of <NUM> to <NUM> .PERIOD <BREAK>
these were bad years ,COMMA and people got fed up with sweden .PERIOD <BREAK>
they can still hunt ,COMMA but they can't be social .PERIOD <BREAK>
so the machine would get started ,COMMA it would travel some distance ,COMMA reacting along the way ,COMMA hit play on an ipod or a tape deck or something that would start playback .PERIOD <BREAK>
thank you .PERIOD <BREAK>
they're no good either .PERIOD <BREAK>
by seeking the god within .PERIOD by cultivating my own inwardness .PERIOD <BREAK>
my response is a sandstone wall made from bacteria and solidified sand ,COMMA stretching across the desert .PERIOD <BREAK>
early filer and late filer .PERIOD <BREAK>
it has happened before in history .PERIOD <BREAK>
i wasn't sure where to go with this .PERIOD i invented cheeto paint .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's titled ,COMMA an american index of the hidden and unfamiliar ,COMMA and it's comprised of nearly <NUM> images .PERIOD <BREAK>

another aspect of contemporary design that i think is mind-opening ,COMMA promising and will really be the future of design ,COMMA is the idea of collective design .PERIOD <BREAK>
i love mythology too much .PERIOD <BREAK>
let's get her going .PERIOD <BREAK>
well ,COMMA we decided to connect these two worlds -- the world of the companies with their water footprints and the world of the farmers with their senior water rights on these creeks .PERIOD <BREAK>
she explained that the father that she'd had would tell them he'd come and pick them up on sunday to go for a walk .PERIOD <BREAK>
the magic of the mechanisms inside each genetic structure saying exactly where that nerve cell should go -- the complexity of these mathematical models of how these things are indeed done are beyond human comprehension .PERIOD <BREAK>
and you wouldn't believe it ,COMMA but the one after that is going to be called the overwhelmingly large telescope .PERIOD <BREAK>
they had low child mortality and small families .PERIOD <BREAK>
they do tastings of these ingredients in the gardening classes .PERIOD <BREAK>
you'll never find indian women so precise .PERIOD <BREAK>
ok .PERIOD coke japan comes out with a new product every three weeks ,COMMA because they have no idea what's going to work and what's not .PERIOD <BREAK>
so with the act of observing consumers ,COMMA changes their behavior .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's such fun !EXCLAMATIONMARK <BREAK>
get out .PERIOD <BREAK>
this business ,COMMA it gets to be addictive ,COMMA you know what i mean ,COMMA when somebody else is picking up the tab .PERIOD <BREAK>
he was worried about right and wrong .PERIOD <BREAK>
so this is some work that we're doing .PERIOD <BREAK>
before it was ,COMMA how do we control their oil ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and so this allows for a controlled delivery of drugs and for reintegration in the environment in all of these formats that you've seen .PERIOD <BREAK>
that is separate and apart from the animal kingdom .PERIOD <BREAK>
and because of that we were able to stop sars .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i said ,COMMA yes ,COMMA i would love to do that .PERIOD it sounds great .PERIOD <BREAK>
like everybody else ,COMMA they said ,COMMA gee ,COMMA thanks doc !EXCLAMATIONMARK that's great !EXCLAMATIONMARK i could use a new print .PERIOD <BREAK>
the world health organization now estimates that one out of five people on the planet is clinically depressed .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i'm no pathologist ,COMMA but you can't tell much from this .PERIOD <BREAK>
we are missing the story of fareeda ,COMMA a music teacher ,COMMA a piano teacher ,COMMA in sarajevo ,COMMA who made sure that she kept the music school open every single day in the four years of besiege in sarajevo and walked to that school ,COMMA despite the snipers shooting at that school and at her ,COMMA and kept the piano ,COMMA the violin ,COMMA the cello playing the whole duration of the war ,COMMA with students wearing their gloves and hats and coats .PERIOD <BREAK>
the only question is ,COMMA how short can you get ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
so basically ,COMMA what this focuses on is saying ,COMMA we can do a lot more by investing in prevention .PERIOD <BREAK>
you probably think the electrons in an electric wire move instantaneously down a wire ,COMMA don't you ,COMMA at the speed of light when you turn the light on .PERIOD they don't .PERIOD <BREAK>
then i remembered it could be a bunch of things .PERIOD <BREAK>
but we also ,COMMA in that period of time ,COMMA added two more members to the nuclear club :COLON pakistan and north korea .PERIOD <BREAK>
and this is the reason :COLON in two countries that hadn't had this disease for more than probably a decade ,COMMA on opposite sides of the globe ,COMMA there was suddenly terrible polio outbreaks .PERIOD <BREAK>
we don't need a reason .PERIOD <BREAK>
when i ask people -- and i've been asking people this question for about <NUM> years -- i ask them ,COMMA where do you go when you really need to get something done ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
i mean ,COMMA one of the messages i like to carry over is ,COMMA what about defending quality of life ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and that means that the online criminals can actually afford to invest into their attacks .PERIOD <BREAK>

that changes everything ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
one of the things that we work on at scvngr is how do you use games to drive traffic and drive business to local businesses ,COMMA to sort of something that is very key to the economy .PERIOD <BREAK>

thank you so much for coming to ted .PERIOD <BREAK>
and though i'm shy of <NUM> ,COMMA it captures my own experience .PERIOD <BREAK>
so let me just switch over so we can do the live demo .PERIOD <BREAK>
these are leaders who ,COMMA in addition to being highly capable ,COMMA possess two important qualities ,COMMA and they are humility and ambition .PERIOD <BREAK>

i'm worried .PERIOD when i first got the invitation ,COMMA they said somewhere in the thing ,COMMA they said ,COMMA <NUM> minutes to change the world ,COMMA your moment onstage .PERIOD <NUM> minutes to change the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
they're easy to be re-adapted .PERIOD <BREAK>
sound down ,COMMA please .PERIOD <BREAK>
but like any basic research ,COMMA when you're really forced to do things that are way beyond existing technology ,COMMA you can get there with micro-technology ,COMMA nanotechnology .PERIOD <BREAK>
so we recently presented the master plan ,COMMA and it has gotten approved .PERIOD <BREAK>
notice ,COMMA again ,COMMA how they decorate their office .PERIOD <BREAK>
and when i was seven years old ,COMMA all of a sudden ,COMMA a search party arrived at my home .PERIOD <BREAK>
well yes we can .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is not the same as compassion ,COMMA but it's conducive to compassion .PERIOD it opens the channels for compassion .PERIOD <BREAK>
the incremental advances have added up to something which is not incremental anymore .PERIOD <BREAK>
who would ever include a drunken guy in a sample ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
i spent a week at sea on a research vessel .PERIOD <BREAK>
but unfortunately ,COMMA you have to experience the actual hotel ,COMMA airline and hospital ,COMMA and then you have that disconnect .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it's just wonderful to see these glimmers of the promise of what can happen if we train our kids right .PERIOD <BREAK>
and your children are playing instruments .PERIOD <BREAK>
and they did this incredible ritual combat dance .PERIOD <BREAK>
thank you .PERIOD <BREAK>
and that's worth noting in particular .PERIOD <BREAK>

either one ,COMMA you're going to lose .PERIOD what i do is ,COMMA i take out the memory card ,COMMA and i fold it in half ,COMMA revealing usb contacts .PERIOD <BREAK>
and what we said ,COMMA my mother and me ,COMMA thank you industrialization .PERIOD <BREAK>

and so what they found ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA is that exploitation really began heavily with the romans .PERIOD <BREAK>
i'm like ,COMMA get it off !EXCLAMATIONMARK don't worry about it ,COMMA you know .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's just cash .PERIOD <BREAK>
and then we also see this movement forward from dollars and cents .PERIOD <BREAK>
and then the movie about this person doing these things ,COMMA then led to this greater renewal .PERIOD <BREAK>
new milk carton :COLON i'm new milk .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is not a drill .PERIOD it's not just the cluelessness of youtube engineers .PERIOD i promise .PERIOD <BREAK>
just look at that for a minute .PERIOD <BREAK>
i brought with me a book of calendars .PERIOD <BREAK>
i started laughing because it got to the point where ,COMMA was i a writer ,COMMA or was i a homeless woman ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
many there were ,COMMA to covet her kiss .PERIOD <BREAK>
this attachment to our own rightness keeps us from preventing mistakes when we absolutely need to and causes us to treat each other terribly .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is the posterior part ,COMMA where his muscles are going to be moving ,COMMA and he's going to be pacing himself .PERIOD <BREAK>
and perry's policy solution was to ask the people of texas to pray for rain .PERIOD <BREAK>
they have been tested in the laboratory .PERIOD <BREAK>
well ,COMMA they came up with three very general criteria .PERIOD first is -- and they're listed here .PERIOD <BREAK>
as food became plentiful here ,COMMA it also meant that we were able to decrease the number of people working in agriculture to something like ,COMMA on average ,COMMA in the high income countries ,COMMA five percent or less of the population .PERIOD <BREAK>
one of the big problems is that for the biologists working at these sites ,COMMA it's rather difficult to collect these animals .PERIOD <BREAK>
now ,COMMA the island of mauritius is a small island off the east coast of madagascar in the indian ocean ,COMMA and it is the place where the dodo bird was discovered and extinguished ,COMMA all within about <NUM> years .PERIOD <BREAK>
all this leads to the development of self-esteem and confidence .PERIOD <BREAK>
in the whole earth catalog ,COMMA my first words were ,COMMA we are as gods ,COMMA and might as well get good at it .PERIOD <BREAK>
and as you can see ,COMMA that's three-quarters of the food that we're eating for the most part :COLON processed foods and fast foods .PERIOD <BREAK>
please stop !EXCLAMATIONMARK <BREAK>
here we come down with the eradication of smallpox ,COMMA better education ,COMMA health service .PERIOD <BREAK>
all of these blocks have names ,COMMA and the streets are just the unnamed spaces in between the blocks .PERIOD <BREAK>
but ,COMMA you know ,COMMA we thought ,COMMA well ,COMMA it's at least <NUM> percent right or <NUM> percent right .PERIOD <BREAK>
and we felt the most important priority was to bring together two sets of problems .PERIOD <BREAK>
now we've got the dawn of interventional surgery here .PERIOD <BREAK>
i have been to the mountain top .PERIOD i can see the future .PERIOD <BREAK>
and this trend of what rachel naomi remen is doing ,COMMA how these kinds of virtues are finding a place in the vocabulary of medicine -- the work fred luskin is doing -- i think this is one of the most fascinating developments of the <NUM> st century -- that science ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA is taking a virtue like compassion definitively out of the realm of idealism .PERIOD <BREAK>
so you have all these pieces of data distributed throughout the network .PERIOD <BREAK>
lem sen ,COMMA who's this guy :COLON i would have made this money ,COMMA too ,COMMA but i've spent all this time looking for the american man who stole my recipe .PERIOD <BREAK>

he talked about how the mandalas of ancient hindu religion were kind of projected into the sky as an attempt to regain some sense of order after the chaos of war .PERIOD <BREAK>
not that you know how long number <NUM> actually is ,COMMA but you would be able to compare number <NUM> against the pantheon with number <NUM> against the baths of caracalla ,COMMA and so on and so forth .PERIOD if you were interested .PERIOD <BREAK>
and he said ,COMMA son ,COMMA it goes on forever .PERIOD <BREAK>
chris anderson :COLON thank you .PERIOD <BREAK>

they don't preserve well ,COMMA as you know .PERIOD <BREAK>
it is barely tethered to any sort of physical reality in our minds .PERIOD <BREAK>
a fundamental issue that's not being addressed .PERIOD <BREAK>
it turns out that a lot of dolphins are being sold as meat in the whale meat market around the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
and on day four ,COMMA we decided to just do a quick five minute test swim .PERIOD <BREAK>
i was able to get four .PERIOD <BREAK>
volcanoes erupt .PERIOD <BREAK>
but before i get to this slide ,COMMA i just wanted to run you through this .PERIOD <BREAK>
and we left ,COMMA and i swore to myself ,COMMA and i was like ,COMMA i'm never ,COMMA ever going to have to beg for anything in my life .PERIOD <BREAK>
we got our first panel out on december third .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA i thought ,COMMA yeah ,COMMA that's probably a good idea .PERIOD <BREAK>
and now ,COMMA maybe ,COMMA we can go back to the bigger question that i started with at the beginning .PERIOD <BREAK>
imagine the darkest ,COMMA emptiest thing you can and cube it a gazillion times and that's where we are .PERIOD <BREAK>
you might have noticed that law has grown progressively denser in your lives over the last decade or two .PERIOD <BREAK>
but we're not using it .PERIOD it's just sitting there .PERIOD <BREAK>
there were several steps to this .PERIOD there were two sides :COLON we had to solve the chemistry for making large dna molecules ,COMMA and we had to solve the biological side of how ,COMMA if we had this new chemical entity ,COMMA how would we boot it up ,COMMA activate it in a recipient cell .PERIOD <BREAK>
one of them is called enceladus .PERIOD <BREAK>
and they did .PERIOD <BREAK>
two stage rockets ,COMMA rockets with video cameras on them ,COMMA on-board computers logging their flights ,COMMA rocket gliders that fly back to earth .PERIOD <BREAK>
and what i wanted to work on is important stuff .PERIOD <BREAK>
i want to know the people behind my dinner choices .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i'm going to play some songs for you tonight that are ,COMMA literally ,COMMA world premieres .PERIOD <BREAK>
and in my idea ,COMMA heaven is satisfied curiosity .PERIOD <BREAK>
i mean ,COMMA there are so many possibilities for why tumors don't go to skeletal muscle .PERIOD <BREAK>
what does that convex lens do ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
a magician promises to deceive you -- and he does .PERIOD <BREAK>
we could have a coast-to-coast ,COMMA free wireless communication system .PERIOD <BREAK>
in this case it's very intuitive ;SEMICOLON this student ,COMMA probably his first time using it ,COMMA doing very complex manipulation tasks ,COMMA picking up objects and doing manipulation ,COMMA just like that .PERIOD very intuitive .PERIOD <BREAK>
they're most often sold to people ,COMMA and people then wind up in debt and have to pay back the debt ,COMMA and sometimes have to sell their property in order to pay back the debt .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i'd like to thank chris for this opportunity to unveil our technology with you ,COMMA and soon the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
they laughed everywhere over the world i showed this .PERIOD <BREAK>
and what's more ,COMMA this guy doesn't need a wire connected all the way back to a power station burning fossil fuels .PERIOD <BREAK>
the personal debt-to-income ratio basically went from <NUM> percent to <NUM> percent in the span of about <NUM> years .PERIOD <BREAK>
the animals are simply gone .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is well beyond organic agriculture ,COMMA which is still a cartesian system ,COMMA more or less .PERIOD <BREAK>
i believe that we can overcome the threats to our consciousness ,COMMA that the human show can stay on the air for millennia to come .PERIOD <BREAK>
raise your hand if you had a serious fall in your household ,COMMA or any of your loved ones ,COMMA your parents or so forth .PERIOD right ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
we all saw how hard you were working .PERIOD <BREAK>
i can pan ,COMMA zoom and rotate it effortlessly .PERIOD <BREAK>
well ,COMMA this is a picture of it .PERIOD <BREAK>
that's a great question .PERIOD <BREAK>
and they supported me a bit ,COMMA and i built this .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the first step took tens of thousands of years -- stone tools ,COMMA fire ,COMMA the wheel -- kept accelerating .PERIOD <BREAK>
and well ,COMMA that was an opera experience .PERIOD <BREAK>
okay ,COMMA so the great majority of us .PERIOD <BREAK>
whatever you're doing with your hands ,COMMA it's understanding that gesture .PERIOD <BREAK>
i say this guy -- alberto giacometti ,COMMA shown here with some of his sculptures on the swiss <NUM> franc note .PERIOD <BREAK>
and where the bible is addressed exclusively to men ,COMMA using the second and third person masculine ,COMMA the koran includes women -- talking ,COMMA for instance ,COMMA of believing men and believing women ,COMMA honorable men and honorable women .PERIOD <BREAK>
these tools don't get socially interesting until they get technologically boring .PERIOD <BREAK>
i want to suggest that there's three things that help us to make our peace with regret .PERIOD <BREAK>
when i was an intern in san francisco ,COMMA i heard about a group of native americans who had taken over alcatraz island ,COMMA and a native american who wanted to give birth on that island ,COMMA and no other doctor wanted to go and help her give birth .PERIOD <BREAK>
one gene is changed out of <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> ,COMMA and look at it .PERIOD <BREAK>
a second part of the brain is called the dorsal stream .PERIOD <BREAK>
because that is what knopf is .PERIOD <BREAK>
there we go .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i'll just say what i'm about to do .PERIOD what i'm about to do -- i hope you can recognize that there's a distorted sine wave ,COMMA almost a triangular wave upon this hewlett-packard oscilloscope .PERIOD <BREAK>
and we picked nine finalists ,COMMA and then those nine finalists were distributed throughout the entire region ,COMMA and then the community picked their design .PERIOD <BREAK>
once you start down at this very humble level ,COMMA then you can start finding ways to see things .PERIOD <BREAK>
they lack even the most basic amenities .PERIOD <BREAK>
and that worthy ambition became his lodestar .PERIOD <BREAK>
alan alda :COLON he's got it ,COMMA he's got it ,COMMA he's got it on his head .PERIOD <BREAK>
my children are growing .PERIOD <BREAK>
and a lot of my experiences resemble mirrors in some way .PERIOD <BREAK>
and what worries me ,COMMA as we stand here in the rubble of the economic collapse ,COMMA is that too many organizations are making their decisions ,COMMA their policies about talent and people ,COMMA based on assumptions that are outdated ,COMMA unexamined ,COMMA and rooted more in folklore than in science .PERIOD <BREAK>
there's a lot to learn from successful landbanking programs in cities like flint ,COMMA michigan .PERIOD <BREAK>
and to cut a long story short ,COMMA eight months later we did fill the chicago cultural center's <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> square foot gallery .PERIOD <BREAK>
i went looking for a farm where these ideas about looking at things from the species' point of view are actually implemented ,COMMA and i found it in a man .PERIOD the farmer's name is joel salatin .PERIOD <BREAK>
this young man posted a video of him abusing his cat on youtube .PERIOD <BREAK>
now ,COMMA my second example is for a slightly younger crowd .PERIOD <BREAK>
and for the first ,COMMA i don't know ,COMMA three to five years of their life ,COMMA mountain bikes were known as clunkers .PERIOD <BREAK>
i think we all kind of stand and watch .PERIOD <BREAK>
it doesn't have the same resonance for us that the arctic national wildlife refuge has ,COMMA but it should ,COMMA i mean ,COMMA it's a bird sanctuary .PERIOD <BREAK>
i'd like to talk a little bit this morning about what happens if we move from design to design thinking .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's so unpredictable and so fragile .PERIOD <BREAK>
and we knew ,COMMA once that worked ,COMMA that we actually had a chance if we could make the synthetic chromosomes to do the same with those .PERIOD <BREAK>
now ,COMMA what stands in the way of this ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
even in bangladesh ,COMMA there are some empty places .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so that gives you an idea of how exquisitely sensitive this is .PERIOD <BREAK>
do you guys see how this ,COMMA right here ,COMMA compared to that -- which one creates that patient problem solving ,COMMA that math reasoning ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
he said ,COMMA it's billy graham ,COMMA the preacher .PERIOD <BREAK>
we need to keep or minds on the molecules and not get distracted by the theater ,COMMA not get distracted by the cognitive dissonance of the green possibilities that are out there .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is rocket science ,COMMA but it's not hard rocket science .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the daughter's husband ,COMMA he also was sick from his wife's exhaustion .PERIOD <BREAK>
my science teacher is shown absolutely beautifully in the movie .PERIOD <BREAK>
i mean just think of the sheer variety -- a baby's face ,COMMA berlioz's harold in italy ,COMMA movies like the wizard of oz or the plays of chekhov ,COMMA a central california landscape ,COMMA a hokusai view of mt .PERIOD fuji ,COMMA der rosenkavalier ,COMMA a stunning match-winning goal in a world cup soccer match ,COMMA van gogh's starry night ,COMMA a jane austen novel ,COMMA fred astaire dancing across the screen .PERIOD <BREAK>
so she belongs to our family tree ,COMMA but within that ,COMMA of course ,COMMA you do detailed analysis ,COMMA and we know now that she belongs to the lucy species ,COMMA known as australopithecus afarensis .PERIOD <BREAK>
so i'm going to give you an example ,COMMA a very simple example of how this works .PERIOD <BREAK>
like i'll read that one of the two attributes of matter in the newtonian universe -- there are two attributes of matter in the newtonian universe -- one is space occupancy .PERIOD matter takes up space .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA the fact that the golden rule is in some sense built in to us is not ,COMMA by itself ,COMMA going to bring us universal love .PERIOD <BREAK>
and if we can look at these things and learn from them and see how to turn them outwards ,COMMA then i really think we have something quite revolutionary on our hands .PERIOD <BREAK>
the result is whether you're looking at the west or the eastern bluefin population ,COMMA there's been tremendous decline on both sides ,COMMA as much as <NUM> percent if you go back with your baseline to <NUM> .PERIOD <BREAK>
and if you don't want to fold <NUM> scales ,COMMA you can back off and just do a few things ,COMMA and add plates to the back of a turtle ,COMMA or toes .PERIOD <BREAK>
we can use thicker ,COMMA younger ,COMMA better tissues than you might have injured in your knee ,COMMA or that you might have when you're <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> or <NUM> .PERIOD <BREAK>
so after putting together a grid of these cubes with tape -- -- michael hacked off the x-ray plate of a mammography machine that was about to be thrown out ,COMMA and we attached the new detector ,COMMA and we decided to call this machine molecular breast imaging ,COMMA or mbi .PERIOD <BREAK>
and we can follow where they flow out from that tumor site ,COMMA so we can see the first places where that cancer might travel .PERIOD <BREAK>
and this is the paradigm that we see throughout the universe .PERIOD <BREAK>
that was in the interests of the species tens of thousands of years ago .PERIOD <BREAK>
let's actually try that .PERIOD <BREAK>
visceral is subconscious ,COMMA you're unaware of it .PERIOD <BREAK>
here was a city telling its child ,COMMA you can .PERIOD <BREAK>
and then we turn the page of the magazine ,COMMA and we see this -- now this is the page the fda requires pharmaceutical companies to put into their ads ,COMMA or to follow their ads ,COMMA and to me ,COMMA this is one of the cynical exercises in medicine .PERIOD <BREAK>
and when the rain does come ,COMMA it so often leads to flooding and added distress ,COMMA and the cycle of poverty and hunger and disease .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's all the pattern recognition .PERIOD <BREAK>
in the book ,COMMA i go over controversies such as this one ,COMMA and a number of other hot buttons ,COMMA hot zones ,COMMA chernobyls ,COMMA third rails ,COMMA and so on -- including the arts ,COMMA cloning ,COMMA crime ,COMMA free will ,COMMA education ,COMMA evolution ,COMMA gender differences ,COMMA god ,COMMA homosexuality ,COMMA infanticide ,COMMA inequality ,COMMA marxism ,COMMA morality ,COMMA nazism ,COMMA parenting ,COMMA politics ,COMMA race ,COMMA rape ,COMMA religion ,COMMA resource depletion ,COMMA social engineering ,COMMA technological risk and war .PERIOD <BREAK>
we can do it with existing political structures .PERIOD <BREAK>
they started suspecting that what we do on the morning ,COMMA and the afternoon ,COMMA it's on the news ,COMMA bbc ,COMMA rfi .PERIOD <BREAK>
that's in his autobiography .PERIOD <BREAK>
we get a little exuberant as we pass gesu ;SEMICOLON it's not surprising to sort of mimic the architecture in this way .PERIOD <BREAK>
on the other hand ,COMMA statistics -- that's a subject that you could ,COMMA and should ,COMMA use on daily basis .PERIOD right ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and what's been taking up the slack in the last few decades ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
an increase of dopamine caused subjects to see more patterns than those that did not receive the dopamine .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it's sort of like a better version of the toolbar .PERIOD <BREAK>
there's a long history in astronomy of unlikely things turning out to be there .PERIOD and i mean ,COMMA the finest example of that was radio astronomy as a whole .PERIOD <BREAK>
one of my favorite facts is that u .PERIOD s .PERIOD agriculture uses <NUM> .PERIOD <NUM> billion pounds of pesticides every year .PERIOD <BREAK>
everybody talks about carbon taxes -- it won't work -- emission schemes ,COMMA but for example ,COMMA one policy measure ,COMMA feed-in tariffs on the energy system ,COMMA which is already applied ,COMMA from china doing it on offshore wind systems ,COMMA all the way to the u .PERIOD s .PERIOD <BREAK>
i then thought it would be years before we'd be able to make it really ,COMMA really useful .PERIOD <BREAK>
now what about the money ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
but they understood something more fundamental -- the sheer joy in discovery ,COMMA the delight and fascination that we get from the world and being ourselves in it ,COMMA the richness that we get from seeing ,COMMA feeling and knowing the lives that we are .PERIOD <BREAK>
four out of five animals on earth are nematode worms -- if all solid materials except nematode worms were to be eliminated ,COMMA you could still see the ghostly outline of most of it in nematode worms .PERIOD <BREAK>
dan ,COMMA i'd like to hear more on this .PERIOD so ,COMMA you're saying that our response to terror is ,COMMA i mean ,COMMA it's a form of mental bug ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
so now -- i always ask ,COMMA why do i put myself in this position ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and the good news was that the institution ,COMMA the banking institution ,COMMA lasted .PERIOD <BREAK>
math is a much broader subject than calculating .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it worked .PERIOD <BREAK>
each bottle is different ,COMMA meaning the water level will give you a different shape .PERIOD <BREAK>
now ,COMMA that's my little ,COMMA depressing story .PERIOD <BREAK>
within a year ,COMMA rainforest crunch was on the shelves .PERIOD <BREAK>
all the theories in physics that we have today properly explain what is called normal matter -- the stuff that we're all made of -- and that's four percent of the universe .PERIOD <BREAK>
and then something remarkable happened in ' <NUM> .PERIOD <BREAK>
all right ,COMMA so tie me to the mast .PERIOD <BREAK>
and what i'd like to talk about is how can we use that feeling to actually create a movement through film ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
watch it as it rotates back again .PERIOD and this is a very bright audience ,COMMA all right ?QUESTIONMARK see if you can stop it from happening ,COMMA even though you know <NUM> percent it's true that -- bam !EXCLAMATIONMARK you can't undo it .PERIOD what does that tell you about yourselves ?QUESTIONMARK we're going to do it again .PERIOD no doubt about it .PERIOD see if you can stop it from happening .PERIOD no .PERIOD it's difficult .PERIOD <BREAK>
you can be sure jefferson knew what he was talking about when he said ,COMMA if a nation expects to be ignorant and free in a state of civilization ,COMMA it expects what never was ,COMMA and never will be .PERIOD <BREAK>
you see ,COMMA the folks at the ministry of health ,COMMA the hospital administrators ,COMMA the doctors ,COMMA the nurses -- they are among just five percent of their peers who get an education after secondary school .PERIOD <BREAK>
and for those of you who love the arts ,COMMA aren't you glad you invited me here to brighten your day ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
because everybody has a digital camera or cell phone camera ,COMMA they took pictures of everything .PERIOD more than <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> .PERIOD <BREAK>
so extroverts really crave large amounts of stimulation ,COMMA whereas introverts feel at their most alive and their most switched-on and their most capable when they're in quieter ,COMMA more low-key environments .PERIOD <BREAK>
and this sequence shows the buildup of that model .PERIOD <BREAK>
and they build a big ,COMMA complex world .PERIOD <BREAK>
here's a real simple example .PERIOD <BREAK>
it just takes a while .PERIOD you've got to go through these phases and stuff ,COMMA and if you're interrupted ,COMMA you don't sleep well .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it was while i was doing my ph .PERIOD d .PERIOD <BREAK>
but not until <NUM> did mathematicians actually understand how they could model it .PERIOD <BREAK>
.PERIOD that's really going to go a long way .PERIOD <BREAK>
so if my voice can touch you ,COMMA if my actions can touch you ,COMMA if my being here can touch you ,COMMA please let it be .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the obsession can get worse when you've been rejected .PERIOD <BREAK>
they say ,COMMA well ,COMMA it's got to be something that's nasty enough that people don't want to be hit with this weapon .PERIOD <BREAK>
i can't figure out why !EXCLAMATIONMARK <BREAK>
there's no working for each other across the colonies .PERIOD <BREAK>
the white group there is the control group ;SEMICOLON they change nothing .PERIOD <BREAK>
audience :COLON t ,COMMA e ,COMMA d .PERIOD <BREAK>
this was a computer-assisted instruction system ,COMMA which in those days ran on a computer named illiac .PERIOD <BREAK>
because this is exactly what our ancestors ,COMMA the homo erectus ,COMMA did .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA if you know you have these kleptoparasitic bees ,COMMA you know that your environment is healthy ,COMMA because they're top-of-the-food-chain bees .PERIOD <BREAK>
some rocks are twins separated at birth .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i’ll give you a quick example .PERIOD <BREAK>
that's the end .PERIOD <BREAK>
and they trained <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> bombardiers on how to use them -- long extensive ,COMMA months-long training sessions -- because these things are essentially analog computers ;SEMICOLON they're not easy to use .PERIOD <BREAK>
i was not the only person editing the open street map .PERIOD <BREAK>
and this is such an inversion ,COMMA and such a wonderful example of children being the agents of change .PERIOD <BREAK>
because the sloth bears in the wild were obviously getting depleted because of this .PERIOD <BREAK>
in other words ,COMMA we can't create supermodel mice .PERIOD <BREAK>
the people who actually have no money ,COMMA who have no extravagant budget ,COMMA but who realize that actually you might achieve greater success in uptake of a government program by actually doubling the level of benefits you pay ,COMMA but you'll probably achieve exactly that same effect simply by redesigning the form and writing it in comprehensible english .PERIOD <BREAK>
and really ,COMMA it ends up being more human than technology ,COMMA because we're co-creating each other all the time .PERIOD <BREAK>
for me ,COMMA the design exercise always begins here with the periodic table ,COMMA enunciated by another professor ,COMMA dimitri mendeleyev .PERIOD <BREAK>
and then ,COMMA there's business model issues about how to try to effectively market it and get it to people .PERIOD <BREAK>
there was lasagna ,COMMA there was casseroles ,COMMA there was brownies ,COMMA there was butter tarts ,COMMA and there was pies ,COMMA lots and lots of pies .PERIOD <BREAK>
harvest contaminated tobacco .PERIOD <BREAK>
the answer that we've traditionally given to that is very straightforward ,COMMA at least in the last <NUM> years :COLON you go to finland .PERIOD <BREAK>
i said ,COMMA well ,COMMA i just did it .PERIOD no one told me that .PERIOD <BREAK>
that's the news from downtown .PERIOD here it is in perspective .PERIOD <BREAK>
our data source decides whether it's reliable data ,COMMA we don't .PERIOD <BREAK>
you'll be able to figure that out .PERIOD <BREAK>
there you go chris .PERIOD <BREAK>
so deep ,COMMA for instance ,COMMA was abraham lincoln's love of shakespeare ,COMMA that he made time to spend more than a hundred nights in the theater ,COMMA even during those dark days of the war .PERIOD <BREAK>
has to come back out ,COMMA whatever you put in .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i said ,COMMA yes .PERIOD and he said ,COMMA why can't i ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
so you have the companies also realizing that sick staff don't work ,COMMA and dead customers don't buy .PERIOD <BREAK>
as history points out ,COMMA regimes become oppressive when they're fearful about keeping control .PERIOD <BREAK>
video :COLON okay ,COMMA we have parachute aligned .PERIOD <BREAK>
and there's a lot to be overwhelmed about ,COMMA to be fair -- an environmental crisis ,COMMA wealth disparity in this country unlike we've seen since <NUM> ,COMMA and globally ,COMMA a totally immoral and ongoing wealth disparity .PERIOD <BREAK>
and who is this guy ,COMMA alex ,COMMA to begin with ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
darwin is a great example of this .PERIOD <BREAK>
and for good reason .PERIOD <BREAK>
now ,COMMA so at this point ,COMMA then ,COMMA what i want to really emphasize to you ,COMMA is that ,COMMA first of all ,COMMA dark matter and dark energy are completely different things ,COMMA ok .PERIOD <BREAK>
luckily ,COMMA this year's flu was relatively mild .PERIOD <BREAK>
and you might think ,COMMA well ,COMMA boy ,COMMA your life support system was failing you .PERIOD wasn't that dreadful ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
you can make free unlimited calls home to the us with these phones .PERIOD so ,COMMA very ,COMMA very interesting .PERIOD <BREAK>
i think it's appropriate to call it the greatest misallocation of resources in the history of the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
he said you needed addition and subtraction .PERIOD <BREAK>

and we're hoping that ,COMMA sort of ,COMMA the enzyme piece of dough becomes the fuel pack for the leavened piece of dough ,COMMA and when we put them together and add the final ingredients ,COMMA we can create a bread that does evoke the full potential of flavor trapped in the grain .PERIOD <BREAK>

her former name was fay wray ,COMMA and so that was -- i didn't have the wit to say ,COMMA take the painting .PERIOD <BREAK>

they tap into local entrepreneurial talent ,COMMA and they do incredible marketing .PERIOD <BREAK>
we sent economists in the soviet union with privatization plans when it broke up ,COMMA and what they really lacked was social trust .PERIOD <BREAK>

there was no ice around .PERIOD <BREAK>
now it's very hard to see the earth there ,COMMA it's called the pale blue dot picture ,COMMA but earth is suspended in that red shaft of light .PERIOD <BREAK>
so you can see that these economic changes really do have a strong effect on our culture .PERIOD <BREAK>
i say the answer is yes .PERIOD <BREAK>
but not the south africa we always talk about -- the gold ,COMMA the minerals ,COMMA the first world infrastructure -- a bit about the other side of it .PERIOD <BREAK>
i'm going to do what philosophers do .PERIOD <BREAK>
these behaviors are just behaviors .PERIOD <BREAK>

we should focus on the positive .PERIOD <BREAK>
and very often they say ,COMMA you know what ,COMMA points a and b are okay ,COMMA but point c ,COMMA you still have some residual cancer there .PERIOD <BREAK>

but more importantly ,COMMA he told stories about the poor that were different than any stories i had heard before .PERIOD <BREAK>
and from that mucus ,COMMA we can get gene profiles ,COMMA we can get information on gender ,COMMA checking the pop-up tag one more time ,COMMA and then it's out in the ocean .PERIOD <BREAK>
they power how a cell replicates .PERIOD they power our hearts .PERIOD <BREAK>

they took the basic ingredients ,COMMA put them in a single jar and ignited them and put a lot of voltage through .PERIOD <BREAK>
we think it's saltwater ,COMMA and that would mean that there's more water on that moon of jupiter than there is in all the oceans of the earth combined .PERIOD <BREAK>
or the swamp at gramercy park ,COMMA right here .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the key to all of this is to make it affordable ,COMMA to make it exciting ,COMMA to get it on a pathway where there's a way to make money doing it .PERIOD <BREAK>
and then as you enter it again ,COMMA looking in all directions towards the city .PERIOD <BREAK>

and that’s why i said ,COMMA thank you for being here .PERIOD <BREAK>
and importantly ,COMMA it's a rich source of vitamin b <NUM> .PERIOD <BREAK>
the more usual case is overeating .PERIOD <BREAK>
because they actually said that you can get any color you like in a spectrum .PERIOD <BREAK>
so facial expressions -- as i mentioned before in emotional experiences -- are actually designed to work out of the box with some sensitivity adjustments available for personalization .PERIOD <BREAK>
and here ,COMMA a very peculiar poster because ,COMMA simply because of using the isometric perspective in the computer ,COMMA it won't sit still in the space .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's fairly dramatic ,COMMA actually ,COMMA to have this happen .PERIOD <BREAK>
and believe it or not ,COMMA that is a taxi in nigeria .PERIOD <BREAK>
and then i'd sell <NUM> at a time of all the crappy ones .PERIOD <BREAK>
we rely on government agencies to tell us what pharmaceuticals are safe .PERIOD <BREAK>
but in order to do this ,COMMA one of the things we really need to do ,COMMA is we need to remember we are people of the hydrocarbon .PERIOD <BREAK>
as my mother said ,COMMA we are the future hope ,COMMA and the men are only killing in somalia .PERIOD <BREAK>

gimme all your money ,COMMA or i'll blow myself up .PERIOD <BREAK>
so the team developed new debugging software ,COMMA where we could test each synthetic fragment to see if it would grow in a background of wild type dna .PERIOD <BREAK>

the guild system :COLON that means when i was an apprentice ,COMMA i had to apprentice myself in order to become a pottery master .PERIOD <BREAK>
you try and think of a different way of saying the same thing ,COMMA or if you know the particular student and that student's cognitive style ,COMMA then you might say it in a way that you think would have a good impedance match with that student .PERIOD <BREAK>
the copy ,COMMA which you can't see because it goes on and on for several pages ,COMMA says that steerage passengers can't get their to bunks before the voyage is over ,COMMA and it's so safe it carries no insurance .PERIOD <BREAK>

well i don't have time to tell you about all the mathematics ,COMMA but underlying this is the social networks ,COMMA because this is a universal phenomenon .PERIOD <BREAK>
they are centered on some more spread out structure ,COMMA and that is the dark matter in which the cluster is embedded ,COMMA ok .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i remember the last time i came back from india -- in my long white flowing robes and my big beard and my john lennon glasses -- and i said to my father ,COMMA dad ,COMMA i think i've just about found spiritual enlightenment .PERIOD <BREAK>
now ,COMMA when i was working in the <NUM> s ,COMMA i spent most of the time covering the appalling conflict in yugoslavia .PERIOD <BREAK>

this is a guy called norman borlaug .PERIOD he won the nobel prize .PERIOD he's got the congressional medal of honor .PERIOD he deserves all of this stuff .PERIOD and he deserves this stuff because he probably has fed more people than any other human being alive because he researched how to put biology behind seeds .PERIOD he did this in mexico .PERIOD the reason why india and china no longer have these massive famines is because norman borlaug taught them how to grow grains in a more efficient way and launched the green revolution .PERIOD that is something that a lot of people have criticized .PERIOD but of course ,COMMA those are people who don't realize that china and india ,COMMA instead of having huge amounts of starving people ,COMMA are exporting grains .PERIOD <BREAK>
someone who has seen the death of a single child now has nothing to lose .PERIOD <BREAK>

in fact not many of you know that our bread ,COMMA of course ,COMMA was not a european invention .PERIOD <BREAK>
with integrated circuits ,COMMA you can build cellphones .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it wouldn’t be interesting to talk about the dawn of books without having a copy of a guttenberg bible .PERIOD <BREAK>
he's planning to eat that fence for dinner .PERIOD <BREAK>
ladies and gentlemen ,COMMA that is not an unusual story .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is ,COMMA on the left there ,COMMA the joyful lady is pat irwin ,COMMA who's the regional head of the national forest service ,COMMA and they gave us the temporary use permit to be there .PERIOD <BREAK>

in a sense ,COMMA the group of betters at the racetrack is forecasting the future ,COMMA in probabilistic terms .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so we finally ended up making it .PERIOD <BREAK>
they are now buying cars .PERIOD <BREAK>
you find these ,COMMA for example ,COMMA in fish oil .PERIOD <BREAK>
so what you see is actually a representation of how well people did what it was they were asked to do .PERIOD <BREAK>
so now ,COMMA the thing is that this is a different kind of spell .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it didn't seem ,COMMA at least ,COMMA that your sell outs ,COMMA whatever they were ,COMMA were very big .PERIOD <BREAK>
if it is sounding familiar ,COMMA it is because i was at the same time in my life listening to the beatles .PERIOD <BREAK>

since <NUM> ,COMMA already two-thirds of households in suburbia did not have kids in them .PERIOD <BREAK>
but the question is ,COMMA does forgiveness and redemption replace justice ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
but when you make those associations ,COMMA you want them to come together in a kind of synergy in the story ,COMMA and what you're finding is what matters .PERIOD the meaning .PERIOD <BREAK>

it's the guidance she gets around infant feeding and safer sex .PERIOD <BREAK>

and what i see is that the animal's brain sets up its initial processing of that sound in a form that's idealized ,COMMA within the limits of its processing achievements to represent it in an organized and orderly way .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA if we can figure out how to do that ,COMMA then we have the vaccine ,COMMA and what's interesting is there already is some evidence that we're beginning to crack that problem .PERIOD <BREAK>
for us human beings ,COMMA and certainly for us as muslims ,COMMA whose mission ,COMMA and whose purpose in following the path of the prophet is to make ourselves as much like the prophet .PERIOD <BREAK>
we were in radio contact with some of them .PERIOD <BREAK>

it had everything in it .PERIOD lawyers can come at the police station .PERIOD it was perfect .PERIOD <BREAK>

the solution to the problem in the middle east ,COMMA according to him ,COMMA is to convert you all to christianity -- just get rid of your religion .PERIOD <BREAK>

and indeed ,COMMA one of the wonderful things about the theory is that if you have super-linear scaling from wealth creation and innovation ,COMMA then indeed you get ,COMMA from the same theory ,COMMA a beautiful rising exponential curve -- lovely .PERIOD <BREAK>
because they understand :COLON there are places for the market and places where the market should not exist ,COMMA where we should be free to enjoy the fellowship of others .PERIOD <BREAK>

how much do i stand to gain from cheating ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
we could conceivably expand the climate window :COLON we could make pinot noir grow maybe in long island ,COMMA god forbid .PERIOD <BREAK>

the mcdonald's model scales .PERIOD <BREAK>

in fact ,COMMA if you look back ,COMMA human communication media and the ways in which we organize socially have been co-evolving for quite a long time .PERIOD <BREAK>

we're going to go on a dive to the deep sea ,COMMA and anyone that's had that lovely opportunity knows that for about two and half hours on the way down ,COMMA it's a perfectly positively pitch-black world .PERIOD <BREAK>
now ,COMMA the angle will have changed a tiny bit ,COMMA so you can see that the reaction is different .PERIOD <BREAK>
and that proportion is primarily genetically determined .PERIOD <BREAK>
that's going to have amazing impacts .PERIOD <BREAK>
i ask you ,COMMA what happened to translation ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
interestingly ,COMMA it's done a crossover before ,COMMA but not the crossovers that matter .PERIOD <BREAK>

both of these rely on cognitive surplus .PERIOD <BREAK>
i saw first-hand a system that is incredibly complex and then at the same time ,COMMA like everything beautiful in nature ,COMMA is utterly simple .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's being produced in large amounts ,COMMA <NUM> to <NUM> metric tons per year in the canary islands in peru ,COMMA and it's big business .PERIOD <BREAK>

this is what's really cool :COLON it's aging more slowly .PERIOD <BREAK>
secondly ,COMMA different types of pivots .PERIOD <BREAK>
i mean ,COMMA you go out on a date with a guy ,COMMA and he picks his nose ;SEMICOLON you don't go out on another date .PERIOD <BREAK>

the world has other universal languages .PERIOD <BREAK>
this sort of tree and bud formation indicates there's inflammation ;SEMICOLON there's likely to be infection .PERIOD <BREAK>
moving on from this ,COMMA the next person to explore this field was a gentleman called hans jenny in the <NUM> s .PERIOD <BREAK>

but the more natural comparison is actually between india and pakistan .PERIOD <BREAK>
we have done already <NUM> exhibitions in the cities .PERIOD <BREAK>
and he said that the explosion was so loud and the light was so intense ,COMMA that he actually had to put his hands in front of his face to protect his eyes .PERIOD <BREAK>
they don't want to be wearing what everybody else is wearing .PERIOD <BREAK>

the story that i told myself was that adventurers looked like this .PERIOD <BREAK>
now ,COMMA pride of place in this practice is given to compassion .PERIOD <BREAK>
we took out a whole circuit in the hotel and just about put on the fire alarm .PERIOD <BREAK>
now ,COMMA that kind of slavery is ,COMMA again ,COMMA pretty much what slavery has been all through human history .PERIOD <BREAK>
average happiness is ,COMMA of course ,COMMA inadequate ,COMMA because it doesn't speak to the moment-by-moment experience ,COMMA and so this is what we think it looks like when you layer in moment-to-moment experience .PERIOD <BREAK>
you've got the disorganized rebels over here .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i said ,COMMA well ,COMMA by whom ?QUESTIONMARK i mean most ,COMMA you know -- there’s three attitudes :COLON you’re right ,COMMA and i don’t know why ,COMMA which is the most rational one at this point .PERIOD <BREAK>

some of them did ;SEMICOLON some of them didn't .PERIOD <BREAK>
for me ,COMMA this is about exploring human limits ,COMMA about exploring the limits of physiology ,COMMA of psychology and of technology .PERIOD they're the things that excite me .PERIOD <BREAK>

john ,COMMA thank you for making science-fiction real .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA i pinged mike and i said ,COMMA mike ,COMMA can you please go get that interview with pink ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
so now ,COMMA i have one last thought ,COMMA which is that it really makes a difference what we say -- the words that come out of our mouth .PERIOD <BREAK>
what's going on in nigeria ?QUESTIONMARK a couple of things .PERIOD <BREAK>
so this is a query that we had -- i guess it's a popular band that was more popular in some parts of the world than others .PERIOD <BREAK>
but all they had was a woman's handbag -- literally one of those basket handbags -- and they tied it to a curtain rope from one of the offices at u .PERIOD n .PERIOD headquarters ,COMMA and created a pulley system into this shaft in this quivering building in the interests of rescuing this person ,COMMA the person we most need to turn to now ,COMMA this shepherd ,COMMA at a time when so many of us feel like we're lacking guidance .PERIOD <BREAK>
so islamism is the problematic idea that really created a lot of problems in the <NUM> th century islamic world .PERIOD <BREAK>
and that's centre point in london .PERIOD <BREAK>
all of our patents ,COMMA our entire approach to patents and invention ,COMMA is based on the idea that the inventor knows what the invention is for ;SEMICOLON we can say what it's for .PERIOD <BREAK>
like ,COMMA let's say ,COMMA if a schoolteacher says ,COMMA she'll simply say ,COMMA to get to the other side .PERIOD <BREAK>

man :COLON now blink right to go right .PERIOD <BREAK>
they don't even have to log in to come use this tool ,COMMA mine this data ,COMMA find interesting things out with this .PERIOD <BREAK>

and part of what mission blue is about is yelling ,COMMA stop !EXCLAMATIONMARK <BREAK>
the poem is called libation ,COMMA and it's for my friend vusi who is in the audience here somewhere .PERIOD <BREAK>

all across the developing world there are millions of parents -- tens ,COMMA hundreds of millions -- who for the first time are with children doing homework and exams .PERIOD <BREAK>
now let's go to young children .PERIOD <BREAK>
and all of this is played out against the backdrop of transient pack ice that moves with wind and tide .PERIOD <BREAK>
so i think that's another big point .PERIOD <BREAK>
he'd gone and stapled two cards ,COMMA very like these ,COMMA together ,COMMA and put a sticker of his favorite character ,COMMA tintin ,COMMA on the front .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it wasn't perfect .PERIOD many children still died ,COMMA but it was certainly better than what they had before .PERIOD <BREAK>

this is my new ,COMMA purpose-built ,COMMA x-ray shed .PERIOD <BREAK>

he went to a bunch of science labs around the world and videotaped everyone as they were doing every little bit of their job .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's a machine that will send particles around a tunnel ,COMMA opposite directions ,COMMA near the speed of light .PERIOD <BREAK>
in colombia ,COMMA we have about <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> laptops .PERIOD <BREAK>
how do we live it successfully ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>

and all of a sudden ,COMMA indian sport had awakened to the reality that you can source the best product for the best price anywhere in the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
this was my little bit of bio-mimicry .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is india ,COMMA and of course it's all the more striking because it was four years later that we all applauded the u .PERIOD s .PERIOD the oldest democracy in the modern world ,COMMA more than <NUM> years of free and fair elections ,COMMA which took till last year to elect a president or a vice president who wasn't white ,COMMA male or christian .PERIOD <BREAK>
that's a good question ,COMMA and we ask ourselves that every day .PERIOD <BREAK>

so you have to make a living cartooning .PERIOD <BREAK>
woman :COLON that's no sacrifice ,COMMA that's revenge !EXCLAMATIONMARK <BREAK>
the industry is <NUM> years old .PERIOD <BREAK>
and orion is really one of the only ,COMMA if not the only ,COMMA off-the-shelf technologies that could do something .PERIOD <BREAK>
and of course ,COMMA we were stunned for a while ,COMMA but when we managed to get our wits about us ,COMMA we looked at it and said ,COMMA my gosh ,COMMA what's going to happen with that little cub ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and the kids soon learn that all projects go awry -- and become at ease with the idea that every step in a project is a step closer to sweet success ,COMMA or gleeful calamity .PERIOD <BREAK>
or if you light it from above ,COMMA it becomes more solid .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it was that picture that made such a profound impact on me because i'll never forget it .PERIOD i remember the very moment .PERIOD <BREAK>

a cage like this -- a cage like this -- provided that you have rats ,COMMA and we have now currently <NUM> tuberculosis rats -- a cage like this ,COMMA operating throughout the day ,COMMA can process <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> samples .PERIOD <BREAK>
so we know how to do this in many of the ways that are up there .PERIOD <BREAK>
this idea of scale is critical .PERIOD <BREAK>
they now have <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> ethanol pumps -- this versus <NUM> in the u .PERIOD s .PERIOD and a paltry two in california -- and in three years their new car fleet has gone from four percent to <NUM> percent flex-fuel .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's said that for bees ,COMMA the flower is the fountain of life ,COMMA and for flowers bees are the messengers of love .PERIOD <BREAK>

you notice here's a big jump when i was a little kid -- and i think that had something to do with giving me the courage to go out and try something that other people weren't having the courage to try .PERIOD <BREAK>
there's an impact ,COMMA it's cumulative .PERIOD <BREAK>
i'll just play one of these and you'll remember it .PERIOD <BREAK>

flight pilots practice in flight simulators so that they don't make real mistakes in planes .PERIOD <BREAK>

but it just helps tell that some people are change agents in the society .PERIOD <BREAK>
this photo is actually from one of the missions in the balkans in the late <NUM> s .PERIOD <BREAK>
now another way we try to increase our happiness is we medicate ourselves .PERIOD <BREAK>
so the project really addresses these three core issues in a new and exciting way ,COMMA i think .PERIOD <BREAK>
and politically ,COMMA it was awful .PERIOD <BREAK>
so let's start just by looking at the co <NUM> emissions from the life cycle .PERIOD <BREAK>
the phrase 'art is whatever' expresses the current inclusiveness that surrounds art-making -- a sort of 'it ain't what you do ,COMMA it's the way that you do it' notion .PERIOD <BREAK>

now this is actually a popular plaque ,COMMA and this is a crowd of overachievers ,COMMA so i'm betting that some of you have this plaque .PERIOD <BREAK>
that means there's literally thousands of new ideas .PERIOD <BREAK>
and if you ask these people why they work on liquid metal battery ,COMMA their answer would hearken back to president kennedy's remarks at rice university in <NUM> when he said -- and i'm taking liberties here -- we choose to work on grid-level storage ,COMMA not because it is easy ,COMMA but because it is hard .PERIOD <BREAK>

but it turns out i was wrong ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK because the ipod came out ,COMMA and it violated every bit of common wisdom .PERIOD <BREAK>
support research institutions ,COMMA because knowledge is an important part of wealth creation .PERIOD <BREAK>
you fall in love with somebody who fits within what i call your love map ,COMMA an unconscious list of traits that you build in childhood as you grow up .PERIOD <BREAK>
the brain drain -- where all of the most educated and qualified leave and never come back .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i did ,COMMA and we ended up naming it duterimbere ,COMMA meaning to go forward with enthusiasm .PERIOD and while we were doing it ,COMMA i realized that there weren't a lot of businesses that were viable and started by women ,COMMA and so maybe i should try to run a business ,COMMA too .PERIOD <BREAK>
and yet ,COMMA all the press is focused on that .PERIOD <BREAK>
it was just extraordinary .PERIOD <BREAK>
what i love about this image is it's made up of concepts ,COMMA it explores our worldviews and it helps us -- it helps me anyway -- to see what others think ,COMMA to see where they're coming from .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA the approach that we started with is to ask :COLON is it really practical to make things of this sort ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
on one hand ,COMMA on the left bank of the river ,COMMA are the people like me who study those planets and try to define the environments .PERIOD <BREAK>
the syndrome ,COMMA the female-pattern now is called microvascular coronary dysfunction ,COMMA or obstruction .PERIOD <BREAK>
but if i say ,COMMA in spite of my body being limited -- if it is black it is not white ,COMMA if it is white it is not black :COLON body is limited any which way you look at it .PERIOD limited .PERIOD <BREAK>
how do i put that simply ?QUESTIONMARK no .PERIOD <BREAK>
well ,COMMA there are many ways of approaching the functions of the human brain .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA can we see that ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
she said ,COMMA that's wei .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it was just a little thing -- it wasn't good for much except text entry -- but my father had told me about moore's law ,COMMA about moore's law back in the ' <NUM> s ,COMMA and i knew what was coming .PERIOD <BREAK>
i don't have time to get into all this ,COMMA but if you want to understand how a brain works ,COMMA you have to understand how the first part of the mammalian neocortex works ,COMMA how it is we store patterns and make predictions .PERIOD <BREAK>
never before in human history have so many people been raised out of such great poverty as happened in china .PERIOD <BREAK>
and one of you is told by the authority ,COMMA the guy in the lab coat ,COMMA your job as teacher is to give this guy material to learn .PERIOD <BREAK>
it just becomes intolerable .PERIOD <BREAK>
i'm telling you this story ,COMMA because actually ever since richard called me and asked me to talk about -- as he asked all of his speakers -- to talk about something that would be new to this audience ,COMMA that we had never talked about ,COMMA never written about ,COMMA i've been planning this moment .PERIOD <BREAK>
that's what we do .PERIOD <BREAK>
so you can see ideas .PERIOD and these ideas developed into prototypes ,COMMA and they were eventually built .PERIOD and currently ,COMMA as of this year ,COMMA there are clinics rolling out in nigeria and kenya .PERIOD <BREAK>
we create mountains of waste .PERIOD <BREAK>
we found spectacular new species ,COMMA the most beautiful and visually stunning things everywhere we looked -- from the shoreline to the abyss ,COMMA form microbes all the way up to fish and everything in between .PERIOD <BREAK>
and you can measure the performance ,COMMA in terms of energy consumption ,COMMA of that building against a typical library .PERIOD <BREAK>
now ,COMMA you see a very interesting pattern here ,COMMA which is first of all ,COMMA two things are vastly over-estimated ,COMMA namely tornadoes and fireworks .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the question is ,COMMA who would go all the way to <NUM> volts ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
students love that tdp .PERIOD they think it's the name of a video game .PERIOD <BREAK>
atul karwal :COLON aproch is an organization which has been doing things for kids earlier .PERIOD <BREAK>
what can damage accumulate in ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and here -- again ,COMMA my favorite example -- is the cookbook ,COMMA the larousse gastronomique .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i use that word advisedly .PERIOD <BREAK>
in other words ,COMMA your perfect non-lethal weapon is something that's perfect for abuse .PERIOD <BREAK>
but if you live in a vacuum ,COMMA if you live on the surface of one of these objects ,COMMA say ,COMMA in the kuiper belt ,COMMA this -- an object like pluto ,COMMA or one of the smaller objects in the neighborhood of pluto ,COMMA and you happened -- if you're living on the surface there ,COMMA and you get knocked off the surface by a collision ,COMMA then it doesn't change anything all that much .PERIOD <BREAK>
why are there even these penguins oiled ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and then i went to business school .PERIOD <BREAK>
people here played it safe .PERIOD <BREAK>
they also cause the light from the star to vary .PERIOD <BREAK>
so one sunday afternoon ,COMMA a man walks into my cashier's booth with this beautiful jewelry box .PERIOD <BREAK>
so long-distance movement of tools is a sign of trade ,COMMA not migration .PERIOD <BREAK>
i had to remain perfectly still and just relax and think that i wasn't in my body ,COMMA and just control that .PERIOD <BREAK>
and that idea stuck in my head .PERIOD <BREAK>
well they do know ,COMMA that if you look at other aquatic mammals ,COMMA the fat that in most land mammals is deposited inside the body wall ,COMMA around the kidneys and the intestines and so on ,COMMA has started to migrate to the outside ,COMMA and spread out in a layer inside the skin .PERIOD <BREAK>
he came up with this bowden-wedge heel that has to be made out of steel or titanium ;SEMICOLON if you make it from some sort of cheaper material ,COMMA it'll actually crack in two .PERIOD <BREAK>
and sometimes asking the real celebrity ,COMMA mistaking them for someone who just looks like the real person ,COMMA which is highly embarrassing .PERIOD <BREAK>
because at first ,COMMA i'd be so excited i would blurt out ,COMMA the dodgers won !EXCLAMATIONMARK or ,COMMA the dodgers lost !EXCLAMATIONMARK <BREAK>
so here are <NUM> dinosaurs .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's more like a mosh pit .PERIOD <BREAK>
is an apollo project of cooperation possible ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
i then proceeded to tell the patient ,COMMA once the patient was dressed ,COMMA the standard things that the person must have heard in other institutions ,COMMA which is ,COMMA this is not in your head .PERIOD <BREAK>
and they would see a coral head ,COMMA maybe <NUM> feet away ,COMMA and start moving over toward that coral head .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the challenge here is a building that will be green ,COMMA that is compact despite its size and is about the human experience of travel ,COMMA is about friendly ,COMMA is coming back to that starting point ,COMMA is very ,COMMA very much about the lifestyle .PERIOD <BREAK>
the self's struggle for authenticity and definition will never end unless it's connected to its creator -- to you and to me .PERIOD <BREAK>
and that is how stethoscope and auscultation was born .PERIOD <BREAK>
and everyone was supposed to be happy in that community and ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA my life was hell .PERIOD i lived with an alcoholic father who beat me and molested me ,COMMA and it was all inside that .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is modifying ibm equipment ,COMMA which is the origins of the whole data-processing industry ,COMMA later at ibm .PERIOD <BREAK>
if you cut open stygimoloch ,COMMA it is doing the same thing .PERIOD <BREAK>
so now i'm like <NUM> yards from my arrival and i'm exhausted ,COMMA so my steps are slow .PERIOD <BREAK>
and we hypothesize based on the tickling study that when one child hits another ,COMMA they generate the movement command .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the answer is :COLON nothing .PERIOD there's nothing in it for the ant .PERIOD <BREAK>
and in here ,COMMA you can see ,COMMA that's a computer-generated head -- pretty good -- attached to the body of an actor .PERIOD <BREAK>
and what is interesting is that this is hugely popular by the people who use it .PERIOD <BREAK>
and hold it there ,COMMA hold it there ,COMMA both of you ,COMMA hold it there .PERIOD <BREAK>
there's toadie ,COMMA dee dee ,COMMA nishi ,COMMA dignity ,COMMA coochie snorcher ,COMMA cooter ,COMMA labi ,COMMA gladis siegelman ,COMMA va ,COMMA wee-wee ,COMMA whore-spot ,COMMA nappy dugout ,COMMA mungo ,COMMA ghoulie ,COMMA powder-box ,COMMA a mimi in miami ,COMMA a split knish in philadelphia ,COMMA and a schmende in the bronx .PERIOD <BREAK>
and thirdly ,COMMA also to increase awareness by the growers to the potential of this industry .PERIOD <BREAK>
it was an incredible surprise to me to find out that there was actually an organization that cared about both parts of my life .PERIOD <BREAK>
and they're understanding more about quantum mathematics .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA next time ,COMMA maybe ,COMMA i'll measure the speed of light !EXCLAMATIONMARK <BREAK>
i want to devote my talk today to the act of speaking itself ,COMMA and how the act of speaking or not speaking is tied so indelibly to one's identity as to force the birth of a new person when it is taken away .PERIOD <BREAK>
the small number of simple principles were very ,COMMA very simple .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the reason it keeps getting worse is that after a natural catastrophe ,COMMA like a hurricane ,COMMA it used to be that there was some kind of successional sequence of recovery ,COMMA but what's going on now is that overfishing and pollution and climate change are all interacting in a way that prevents that .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's infant mortality .PERIOD <BREAK>
back then -- actually my first expedition was when i was <NUM> years old .PERIOD it was <NUM> years ago .PERIOD <BREAK>
i didn't know where my corners were ,COMMA so i decided to let the whole thing grow ,COMMA and this is what i looked like by the end .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's called a carbon-oxygen dwarf .PERIOD <BREAK>
so i brought back the rabbit ,COMMA the dragonfly ,COMMA to stay in that street .PERIOD <BREAK>
but ,COMMA this is really just the tip of the iceberg .PERIOD <BREAK>
well ,COMMA if that bag of chips then becomes inherently more expensive than an apple ,COMMA then maybe it's time for a different sense of personal responsibility in food choice because the choices are actually choices instead of three-quarters of the products being made just from corn ,COMMA soy and wheat .PERIOD <BREAK>
for instance ,COMMA when i started ,COMMA there were wars in the balkans .PERIOD <BREAK>
and most places in the universe ,COMMA a typical place in the universe ,COMMA is nowhere near any galaxies .PERIOD <BREAK>
but i would say that -- and many other authors and speakers about this ,COMMA other than me ,COMMA have said ,COMMA you know ,COMMA fasten your seat belts because the change is coming .PERIOD there are going to be big changes .PERIOD <BREAK>
i ,COMMA me ,COMMA me ,COMMA mine .PERIOD it's like a perfect song ,COMMA that song .PERIOD a perfect teaching .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the snail's wired to a stick ,COMMA so he's a little bit easier to set up the shot .PERIOD and -- yeah .PERIOD <BREAK>
like my good friends ,COMMA dean and maysoon ,COMMA at the bottom of the screen ,COMMA who ,COMMA two years after <NUM> / <NUM> ,COMMA started a festival to change the way middle easterners are perceived in the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
now ,COMMA sylvia browne is the big operator .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is not the way they teach you to silver solder when you're in school .PERIOD <BREAK>
he did after all have a toy gun .PERIOD <BREAK>
i got bored and left ,COMMA and as i drove out ,COMMA i drove past the slums of bombay ,COMMA as you always do ,COMMA and i saw lines and lines in the hot midday sun of women and children with buckets waiting for a tanker to come and give them water .PERIOD <BREAK>
all across eastern europe ,COMMA a most momentous episode in our post-war history .PERIOD <BREAK>
we need to begin to manage this planet as if our life depended on it ,COMMA because it does ,COMMA it fundamentally does .PERIOD <BREAK>
okay ,COMMA this is skimming stones .PERIOD <BREAK>
that thing on the top is the world's first solar-powered garden lamp -- the first produced .PERIOD giles revell should be talking here today -- amazing photography of things you can't see .PERIOD <BREAK>
i am the life-force power of the <NUM> trillion beautiful molecular geniuses that make up my form ,COMMA at one with all that is .PERIOD <BREAK>
i just did tasks .PERIOD <BREAK>
the private sector doesn't naturally put its resources into these things .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i can't see myself going into a state prison in new jersey and making such a proposition ,COMMA but this being israel ,COMMA the warden somehow made it happen .PERIOD <BREAK>
and back in the <NUM> s ,COMMA when we wanted the money for the lhc from the u .PERIOD k .PERIOD government ,COMMA margaret thatcher ,COMMA at the time ,COMMA said ,COMMA if you guys can explain ,COMMA in language a politician can understand ,COMMA what the hell it is that you're doing ,COMMA you can have the money .PERIOD <BREAK>
really ,COMMA we have two separate concepts mapped onto the same word .PERIOD <BREAK>
they had to turn the spigot entirely off .PERIOD <BREAK>
and with that confidence surge ,COMMA i thought ,COMMA well ,COMMA it's time to create a real bakery ,COMMA so let's paint it .PERIOD and the women said ,COMMA that's a really great idea .PERIOD <BREAK>
we needed to be working on lumber .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the u .PERIOD s .PERIOD military spends <NUM> .PERIOD <NUM> billion dollars -- billion dollars in <NUM> dollars -- developing the norden bombsight .PERIOD <BREAK>
these artifacts and designs are inspiring .PERIOD <BREAK>
we can play cricket together ,COMMA we can be friends .PERIOD <BREAK>
but we don't just do that either .PERIOD <BREAK>
i'm happy to share a little more love in the world ,COMMA it's great ,COMMA but here's your prescription from dr .PERIOD love :COLON eight hugs a day .PERIOD <BREAK>
and that's what we did .PERIOD we went to haiti ,COMMA we went to rwanda ,COMMA afghanistan ,COMMA ethiopia ,COMMA mongolia .PERIOD <BREAK>
well ,COMMA often we're unaware of the fact that we're living in environments in which our skin is inherently poorly adapted .PERIOD <BREAK>
we have to stop that .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i ended up on top .PERIOD <BREAK>
now there's another perverse thing about the way we buy gas ,COMMA which is that we'd rather be doing anything else .PERIOD <BREAK>
followed by that ,COMMA you see on the west coast planes moving across ,COMMA the red-eye flights to the east coast .PERIOD <BREAK>
and nobody really knows what it is or why it's there .PERIOD <BREAK>
multiply <NUM> times <NUM> ,COMMA make sure you get <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> ,COMMA or the calculators are not working .PERIOD do all of you get <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> ?QUESTIONMARK <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
they were almost impossible to swallow .PERIOD <BREAK>
and those of you who are employers know exactly what i mean .PERIOD <BREAK>
we would have released them .PERIOD <BREAK>
we construct it and we construct those ideas .PERIOD <BREAK>
how the media covers africa in the west ,COMMA and the consequences of that .PERIOD <BREAK>
and at night ,COMMA just one line of light cuts through the mountain ,COMMA which is a skylight on top of that triangle .PERIOD <BREAK>
unicef came forward and said ,COMMA we'll buy most of the nets ,COMMA and then we'll give them away ,COMMA as part of the global fund's and the u .PERIOD n .PERIOD 's commitment to pregnant women and children ,COMMA for free .PERIOD <BREAK>
so after i had spent some years in the u .PERIOD s .PERIOD as an african ,COMMA i began to understand my roommate's response to me .PERIOD <BREAK>
can you imagine saying that ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
this is happening ,COMMA however ,COMMA against the background of the rise of web logging .PERIOD <BREAK>
i picked this up at mit .PERIOD it's a little younger .PERIOD <BREAK>
you can also see that there's a lot of short sequence motifs that repeat over and over and over again ,COMMA so for example there's a lot of what we call polyalanines ,COMMA or iterated a's ,COMMA aaaaa .PERIOD there's ggq .PERIOD there's ggy .PERIOD <BREAK>
and whether it's jewish or whether it's muslim or whether it's hindu ,COMMA or whether it's sikh ,COMMA the same global ethic is at the heart of each of these religions .PERIOD <BREAK>
and what it is ,COMMA is working with both positive and negative space but also with these curves .PERIOD <BREAK>
what does it look like ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
you have to go in a school bus .PERIOD <BREAK>
and <NUM> years after ,COMMA they called us to develop -- we're developing this idea .PERIOD <BREAK>
after these genomes are synthesized ,COMMA the first step is just transplanting them into a cell without a genome .PERIOD <BREAK>
what do i have in mind ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
think dante ,COMMA shakespeare ,COMMA the bible ,COMMA news of the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
the places that we would most like to have really clean energy occur are china ,COMMA india ,COMMA europe ,COMMA north america ,COMMA all of which have sorted out their situation in relation to nuclear weapons .PERIOD <BREAK>
but he was completely convinced that his world wide web would take over the world one day .PERIOD <BREAK>
and of course i did .PERIOD <BREAK>
you know ,COMMA people say intuitive ,COMMA you know that's like you're in touch with nature ,COMMA in touch with yourself and relationships .PERIOD <BREAK>
there could be other solutions .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA a new vocabulary of form is now pervading all design fields :COLON whether it's automobiles ,COMMA architecture ,COMMA products ,COMMA etc .PERIOD it's really being affected by this digital medium of curvature .PERIOD <BREAK>
will the former rich countries really accept a completely changed world economy ,COMMA and a shift of power away from where it has been the last <NUM> to <NUM> to <NUM> years ,COMMA back to asia ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
that means a christmas tree ,COMMA a big christmas tree .PERIOD <BREAK>
she's very happy about her minister of energy that provided electricity to everyone -- so happy that she even voted for her .PERIOD <BREAK>
we want all of you here ,COMMA church america ,COMMA corporate america ,COMMA microsoft america ,COMMA apple america ,COMMA coke america ,COMMA pepsi america ,COMMA nerd america ,COMMA noisy america .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i call it hometown security .PERIOD <BREAK>
sorry .PERIOD bf :COLON having some bad flashbacks .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i think that's also part of life .PERIOD <BREAK>
well ,COMMA to describe our profession otherwise ,COMMA we are actually concerned with the playful search for beauty .PERIOD <BREAK>
we buy stuff we didn't know we needed .PERIOD <BREAK>
so let's see if einstein will sing happy birthday to al gore .PERIOD <BREAK>
and we're discovering ,COMMA with our research ,COMMA that's often very local to the node you care about within one or two degrees .PERIOD <BREAK>
they account for less than three percent of our total regrets .PERIOD <BREAK>
and there are a lot of people doing this ,COMMA a lot of synthetic biologists doing this ,COMMA like craig venter .PERIOD <BREAK>
because the people who were gathering brazil nuts weren't the same people who were cutting the forests .PERIOD <BREAK>
at this point in her life ,COMMA she's suffering with full-blown aids and had pneumonia .PERIOD <BREAK>
and this means that these things do exist in our universe ,COMMA and we have to contend with this ,COMMA we have to explain how you can get these objects in our physical world .PERIOD <BREAK>
so i'm not that unhappy about that .PERIOD <BREAK>
our products are the best they've ever been ,COMMA inspired by design for sustainability ,COMMA an unexpected wellspring of innovation .PERIOD <BREAK>
and ibm ,COMMA which made them ,COMMA just didn't know what to do .PERIOD <BREAK>
but i found my place .PERIOD <BREAK>
so everyone of you turns to their neighbor please .PERIOD <BREAK>
or so we thought ,COMMA until a woman came rushing across the campus and dropped her bag on the floor ,COMMA pointed up to the sign and said ,COMMA who's falafel ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
now ,COMMA boyle was a friend of charles ii .PERIOD <BREAK>
these aren't the last words i'll share .PERIOD <BREAK>
they trust their ears .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it's all solid steel -- you can hear here .PERIOD <BREAK>
and here's the guide for the perplexed by maimonides .PERIOD <BREAK>
just <NUM> years ago ,COMMA both the u .PERIOD s .PERIOD and france were saying they were investing militarily in cyberspace ,COMMA strictly to defend their it systems .PERIOD <BREAK>
the more we keep on using the oil ,COMMA particularly the imported oil ,COMMA the more we face a very obvious array of problems .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA i got working .PERIOD i took some sheets of paper and started practicing ,COMMA practicing ,COMMA practicing ,COMMA until i reached what i thought was a steady hand ,COMMA and went into action .PERIOD <BREAK>
usually i'm wearing a helmet .PERIOD in the mountains i'm always wearing a helmet because of landings -- usually it's difficult -- it's not like regular skydiving where you have like the big landings .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i don't know if there's a stronger kind of effect than pattern and the way it unites kind of disparate elements .PERIOD <BREAK>
so i think that ,COMMA as a symbol ,COMMA it's important .PERIOD <BREAK>
because some cycle ,COMMA there is a spot in the cycle ,COMMA and you have not the same duty in the different parts of the cycle .PERIOD <BREAK>
but you might ask ,COMMA well so what in any case ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
i'm not going to answer that .PERIOD but i will answer some of the more popular questions .PERIOD <BREAK>
you can imagine what something like this might look like five ,COMMA <NUM> or <NUM> years from now as our technical capabilities improve .PERIOD <BREAK>
in winter ,COMMA exactly the opposite is happening .PERIOD <BREAK>
we got <NUM> of the world's best economists ,COMMA three in each area .PERIOD <BREAK>
they're carrying instruments that are actually taking data down to <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> meters .PERIOD <BREAK>
we tend to form clusters based on similarity ,COMMA and then we produce stereotypes about other clusters of people .PERIOD <BREAK>
i want you to see part of what i practiced .PERIOD <BREAK>
my mind was so shattered .PERIOD <BREAK>
the slide you're looking at here is <NUM> to <NUM> .PERIOD <BREAK>
put yourself in the position of the kidnapper wanting to bribe the officer .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is a million people gathering on the banks of the ganges in <NUM> ,COMMA perhaps the largest single gathering of human beings ever ,COMMA as seen from satellite photograph .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's not having experiences that make us wise ,COMMA it's reflecting on the experiences that we've had that makes us wise -- and that helps us become whole ,COMMA brings wisdom and authenticity .PERIOD <BREAK>
well if you look at the macro level ,COMMA it seems more money ,COMMA more hiv .PERIOD <BREAK>
you have a mind .PERIOD and you have other people .PERIOD <BREAK>
we eat insects -- they're so distantly related from us that this doesn't happen .PERIOD <BREAK>
so it’s a joke against myself .PERIOD <BREAK>
and that ,COMMA after a couple of days ,COMMA made the kenyan press feel safe to talk about it .PERIOD <BREAK>
i believe that mars is the most likely target for life outside the earth .PERIOD <BREAK>
so this is how this scheme would look .PERIOD <BREAK>
i think in absolute terms ,COMMA last year we earned about <NUM> -odd million dollars ,COMMA spent about <NUM> million ,COMMA with over a <NUM> percent ebita .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's a pre-competitive issue .PERIOD <BREAK>
you said spades ?QUESTIONMARK lg :COLON ah .PERIOD <BREAK>
and audio came very late because our ears are so hard to fool -- they're high-resolution ,COMMA and they're wired straight to our emotions ,COMMA and you can't trick them very easily .PERIOD <BREAK>
he gives them a platform ;SEMICOLON he gives them some rules ;SEMICOLON he gives them the tools and then he kind of orchestrates the conversation ;SEMICOLON he orchestrates the action .PERIOD <BREAK>
well ,COMMA it's not the lava that kills anything ,COMMA it's the carbon dioxide that comes out with it .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so i'll take you to wichita ,COMMA kansas ,COMMA where i was asked some years ago to do a science museum on a site ,COMMA right downtown by the river .PERIOD <BREAK>
britain ,COMMA america ,COMMA japan ,COMMA south africa ,COMMA the congo .PERIOD <BREAK>
and you weigh these options out -- you do the simple cost-benefit analysis ,COMMA and you decide whether it's worthwhile to commit the crime or not .PERIOD <BREAK>
imagine making all of our hard materials that way .PERIOD <BREAK>
in the <NUM> s we had the reagan revolution ,COMMA which lead to deregulation .PERIOD <BREAK>
so i think these projects i've showed here are just a tiny step towards this future ,COMMA if we implement these new technologies for a new self-assembling world .PERIOD <BREAK>
so it's ,COMMA for me ,COMMA a great product .PERIOD <BREAK>
another example of this sort of second superpower thing is the rise of these games that are what we call serious play .PERIOD <BREAK>
they take that information inside ,COMMA and they decide what tasks to carry out depending on who's in the minority and who's in the majority of any given population .PERIOD <BREAK>
what i'm going to try and do now is to square ,COMMA in my head ,COMMA four two-digit numbers faster than they can do on their calculators ,COMMA even using the shortcut method .PERIOD <BREAK>
and we calculated that some <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> tons of grain was left in the fields to rot in early <NUM> .PERIOD <BREAK>
but i am surprised by one thing that they do have :COLON coca-cola .PERIOD <BREAK>
stay here .PERIOD i've got a question .PERIOD <BREAK>
i got very nervous -- no rope ,COMMA no safety line ,COMMA the whole world is moving around me -- and i thought ,COMMA i'm in trouble .PERIOD <BREAK>
now fast forward to <NUM> :COLON half the world's people -- more than half -- still live in asia ,COMMA but they're now making only a fifth of the world's product .PERIOD <BREAK>
an australian study in <NUM> found that olive oil in combination with fruits ,COMMA vegetables and pulses offers measurable protection against skin wrinklings .PERIOD <BREAK>
we killed every single one of them .PERIOD <BREAK>
what's really going on ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
you've got to convey passion .PERIOD <BREAK>
the billboards say lab space available .PERIOD <BREAK>
you also have three microprocessors .PERIOD <BREAK>
mostly they're worried about each other .PERIOD <BREAK>
when i asked her if she feared anything ,COMMA or whether she would miss anything from mathare ,COMMA she said ,COMMA what would i fear that i haven't confronted already ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
this may actually be heresy to say this at ted ,COMMA but i'd like to introduce you to the most important innovation ,COMMA i think ,COMMA in medicine to come in the next <NUM> years ,COMMA and that is the power of the human hand -- to touch ,COMMA to comfort ,COMMA to diagnose and to bring about treatment .PERIOD <BREAK>
if the inspector did come along ,COMMA it would be amazing if they were able to resist the bribe .PERIOD <BREAK>
now -- oh ,COMMA oh yeah ,COMMA go on then ,COMMA go on .PERIOD <BREAK>
if i'd have waited around for that ,COMMA i would have never -- the frog would have died ,COMMA you know .PERIOD <BREAK>
during the same year almost every himba had a rifle .PERIOD <BREAK>
he's recognized as being the father of video games in europe .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA like ,COMMA ok ,COMMA maybe it had to do with the patterns on the little pieces of paper -- you know ,COMMA like ,COMMA it was a diamond ,COMMA or ,COMMA you know ,COMMA diagonal .PERIOD <BREAK>
in that very short learning curve ,COMMA you guys have gone from broken organs up to the fact that you're only <NUM> minutes off the male world record .PERIOD <BREAK>
of course ,COMMA that official is now dead ,COMMA and i'm not ,COMMA so there's a certain amount of glory in outliving your adversaries .PERIOD <BREAK>
yes ,COMMA we slaughter ,COMMA you know .PERIOD yes ,COMMA that's life .PERIOD <BREAK>
but electricity is also very ,COMMA very broad ,COMMA so you have to sort of narrow it down .PERIOD <BREAK>
we're looking at building on some of the most precious resources of africa :COLON people .PERIOD <BREAK>
but deeply tucked into the fabric of space itself ,COMMA the idea is there could be more dimensions ,COMMA as we see there .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it came up with <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> different species of products .PERIOD <BREAK>
this control of muscle is very ,COMMA very important ,COMMA because ,COMMA you know ,COMMA there can be reflexes .PERIOD <BREAK>
so what you need to do is figure out who does care .PERIOD <BREAK>
what good is that ,COMMA to know these things ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
it senses it by chemical means and very importantly by mechanical means ,COMMA because it has to move the food -- it has to mix all the various elements which we need for digestion .PERIOD <BREAK>
the problem with this is they were constrained with samples .PERIOD <BREAK>
eighty thousand people spread over the entire valley .PERIOD <BREAK>
but when something is feasible in thousands of laboratories all over the world ,COMMA which is going to be the case with these technologies ,COMMA when there are large numbers of people who see them as beneficial ,COMMA which is already the case ,COMMA and when they're almost impossible to police ,COMMA it's not a question of if this is going to happen ,COMMA it's when and where and how it's going to happen .PERIOD <BREAK>
or are there more systematic factors at work ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
the mechanism of helicopters seats and windows was used ,COMMA by the way ,COMMA as well as a dashboard that was inspired by two-wheelers .PERIOD <BREAK>
i think we all always have the choice in the end not to do the bad thing .PERIOD <BREAK>
this guy's shirt says ,COMMA stop bitching ,COMMA start a revolution .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's not only the giving of answers .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so you'd have this wonderful sparkling thing ,COMMA with the disk slowly rotating ,COMMA and this is roughly what it would look like .PERIOD and so really ,COMMA part of this is about bringing the beauty of this ,COMMA of the natural world ,COMMA to somebody in a very imaginative way ,COMMA so that they can start calibrating their instinct across these vast scales of space and time .PERIOD <BREAK>
so i studied her mammogram ,COMMA and i reviewed the radiology literature ,COMMA and i was shocked to discover that ,COMMA in her case ,COMMA our chances of finding a tumor early on the mammogram were less than the toss of a coin .PERIOD <BREAK>
what are you doing here ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
i think that generally an 'agnostic' would be the most correct description of my state of mind .PERIOD <BREAK>
then ,COMMA it is years of deadly damage control ,COMMA frankensteins of sieges and surges and counter-insurgencies ,COMMA and once again ,COMMA no exit strategy .PERIOD <BREAK>
i have the wrist rotation that goes -- and it can go all the way around .PERIOD <BREAK>
well ,COMMA it's aspirational .PERIOD <BREAK>
power .PERIOD <BREAK>
even in the year scale ,COMMA one can see a decline of violence .PERIOD <BREAK>
they were bombing -- not very close -- but you could hear the noise of the bombs .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the other thing that one should take away from this chart is the very narrow range of time over which humans can claim to be the dominant intelligence on the planet .PERIOD <BREAK>
people who would have specialized in killing the animals ,COMMA hunting the animals on those meat locker savannahs ,COMMA moving up ,COMMA following the grasslands into the middle east around <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> years ago ,COMMA during one of the rare wet phases in the sahara .PERIOD <BREAK>
now ,COMMA what has happened ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and when she got up ,COMMA she says she couldn't see .PERIOD <BREAK>

and so it goes .PERIOD <BREAK>
that little tag can record temperature ,COMMA depth and light intensity ,COMMA which is correlated with time ,COMMA and from that we can get locations .PERIOD <BREAK>

even goldman sachs once used to serve clients ,COMMA before it turned into an institution that serves only itself .PERIOD <BREAK>

and in a number of studies ,COMMA it's possible to compare how people do in more and less equal countries at each level in the social hierarchy .PERIOD <BREAK>
all of them are connected ,COMMA as you can see ,COMMA to form a picture of me on the web .PERIOD <BREAK>

if one has to blame oneself ,COMMA one has a million reasons plus many .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is at an early stage ,COMMA but you can show with the exponential growth of the amount of information about the brain and the exponential improvement in the resolution of brain scanning ,COMMA we will succeed in reverse-engineering the human brain by the <NUM> s .PERIOD <BREAK>
but if we think about the dependency that we have on this other technology ,COMMA called the alphabet ,COMMA and writing ,COMMA we're totally dependent on it ,COMMA and it's transformed culture .PERIOD <BREAK>
larger packs at the beginning of the month ,COMMA smaller packaging at the end of the month .PERIOD <BREAK>

it's a bit eerie ,COMMA isn't it ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
so we go online ,COMMA and we put in cats mating .PERIOD <BREAK>
and there's a very important distinction there that we'll get to .PERIOD <BREAK>

it's based on norse legend .PERIOD <BREAK>
and that allows us to understand who's doing it well ,COMMA and call them out ,COMMA and find out what those techniques are .PERIOD <BREAK>

here's danny hillis in the midst of a bristlecone pine forest on long now land .PERIOD i should say that the age of bristlecones was discovered ,COMMA led by a theory .PERIOD <BREAK>
and to end all of this ,COMMA at the end of this long process ,COMMA we're not even managing to feed the planet properly .PERIOD <BREAK>
then here we go .PERIOD <BREAK>
let's see ,COMMA i'd say about three or four percent .PERIOD <BREAK>
we need ,COMMA you know ,COMMA <NUM> days on <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> processors to do the kind of simulation that i showed you before .PERIOD <BREAK>
ok .PERIOD i'm at the third and last part of this ,COMMA which i said i would make an attempt to at least give you some examples that may be more directly related to the world of entertainment .PERIOD <BREAK>
one part of medicine ,COMMA though ,COMMA has faced the problem of behavior change pretty well ,COMMA and that's dentistry .PERIOD <BREAK>
it doesn't really work in this context .PERIOD <BREAK>
and you have cds in your car ,COMMA and you go to the symphony .PERIOD <BREAK>
next line of code ,COMMA tacgggg :COLON make a flower that's white ,COMMA that blooms in the spring ,COMMA that smells like this .PERIOD <BREAK>
so i can determine ,COMMA when you're looking at something ,COMMA whether you're excited or whether you're aroused ,COMMA or not ,COMMA ok ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and most of that growth is not in the cities ,COMMA but in the slums that surround them .PERIOD <BREAK>
you can do this in groups as well .PERIOD <BREAK>
but the fact is we do know a lot about all of those things .PERIOD <BREAK>
very few cities fail .PERIOD <BREAK>
and there's another cognitive bias i'll call confirmation bias ,COMMA where we tend to accept data that confirms our beliefs and reject data that contradicts our beliefs .PERIOD <BREAK>
we don't know what's going on half the time ,COMMA so it puts us in a very tenuous position .PERIOD <BREAK>
this was basically an attempt to teach our schoolchildren that if we did get engaged in a nuclear confrontation and atomic war ,COMMA then we wanted our school children to kind of basically duck and cover .PERIOD <BREAK>
thank you very much .PERIOD <BREAK>
and that's really what i do as a writer ,COMMA as a storyteller ,COMMA is try to make people feel what we know and tell stories that actually help us think ecologically .PERIOD <BREAK>
and schlepping is an ancient and honorable art .PERIOD <BREAK>
so the rhythms could be pretty intact too ,COMMA pretty concise .PERIOD <BREAK>
one stood out in particular .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is actual <NUM> d points with two to three millimeter accuracy .PERIOD <BREAK>
and this zero hunger program costs .PERIOD <NUM> percent of gdp and has lifted many millions of people out of hunger and poverty .PERIOD <BREAK>
but we forgive you ,COMMA because you didn't know it .PERIOD <BREAK>
we create things .PERIOD <BREAK>
very hard to find .PERIOD maybe you've got some examples of it .PERIOD <BREAK>
but brenda ,COMMA not being phased by stuff like that ,COMMA took a look at her challenge and came up with a not-so-obvious solution :COLON create a business that produces skin care products from honey .PERIOD <BREAK>
how many people here would say you're a maker ,COMMA if you raise your hand ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
we've all seen the photos of the collapsed buildings in haiti .PERIOD <BREAK>
and then ,COMMA in economics ,COMMA there's an active producer and a passive consumer ,COMMA which explains why business always has to penetrate new markets .PERIOD <BREAK>
so even though it's a global company ,COMMA they take a very local approach .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so then i went back into the research and spent the next couple of years really trying to understand what they ,COMMA the whole-hearted ,COMMA what choices they were making ,COMMA and what are we doing with vulnerability .PERIOD <BREAK>
we worry more about how we're judged and seen by others ,COMMA whether we're regarded as attractive ,COMMA clever ,COMMA all that kind of thing .PERIOD <BREAK>
and instead of using that money to top up my own phone ,COMMA i call up the local village operator .PERIOD <BREAK>
by <NUM> years later ,COMMA evidence of global warming was much stronger .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's very ,COMMA very difficult to speak at the end of a conference like this ,COMMA because everyone has spoken .PERIOD everything has been said .PERIOD <BREAK>
that's a fantastic way to be ,COMMA but it does tend to leave you waking up crying at three o'clock in the morning .PERIOD <BREAK>
and they find out what is right their own way ,COMMA their own selves .PERIOD <BREAK>
but it turns out this is just a reminder that ,COMMA although this is a lot of fun ,COMMA when you interpret these graphs ,COMMA you have to be very careful ,COMMA and you have to adopt the base standards in the sciences .PERIOD <BREAK>
we get that from the census data .PERIOD <BREAK>
that's a bono ,COMMA this is a bono .PERIOD <BREAK>
it starts about <NUM> .PERIOD and the electric fan was a big success .PERIOD <BREAK>
when people were looking at <NUM> percent of their neighborhoods dying in the space of seven days ,COMMA there was a widespread consensus that this couldn't go on ,COMMA that people weren't meant to live in cities of <NUM> .PERIOD <NUM> million people .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i'm getting fantastic help from the community ;SEMICOLON this is just such a great community .PERIOD and combined ,COMMA our contacts reach pretty much everyone who's interesting in the country ,COMMA if not the planet .PERIOD <BREAK>

this tuna is actually moving on a numerical ocean .PERIOD <BREAK>
what would thomas jefferson have said ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
we talk of people as human capital .PERIOD <BREAK>
i told you i'd have the last laugh .PERIOD <BREAK>
this entrepreneurial energy is emerging from many quarters .PERIOD <BREAK>
we extracted the key bits on information to build the database .PERIOD <BREAK>
the other fact is that the ground state ,COMMA the lowest energy state of a quantum system ,COMMA the wave function is always very smooth -- has the minimum number of wiggles .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so in some sense they literally ,COMMA they had such a symbolic view of mathematics ,COMMA they couldn't actually see what was going on on the lettuce in front of them .PERIOD <BREAK>
but we collected more hypersonic flight data than in <NUM> years of ground-based testing combined .PERIOD <BREAK>
it leads us right back to this idea of kaluza and klein -- that our world ,COMMA when appropriately described ,COMMA has more dimensions than the ones that we see .PERIOD <BREAK>
don't want it to leave me behind .PERIOD <BREAK>
i swear to god .PERIOD i mean ,COMMA when you look at the box ,COMMA and you sort of see how it works .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's not that i didn't have help ,COMMA but honestly ,COMMA i sort of led ,COMMA i was the team leader .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's not about low cost .PERIOD <BREAK>
i've heard this dress actually sort of sounds like wind chimes as they walk through .PERIOD <BREAK>

they challenge what's currently there .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA you know ,COMMA you've got to actually do your homework ,COMMA in order to understand whether this is true .PERIOD <BREAK>
and that same year ,COMMA <NUM> years ago ,COMMA i headed north to the phoenix islands .PERIOD <BREAK>
let's rebrand global warming ,COMMA as many of you have suggested .PERIOD <BREAK>

last march ,COMMA we received very sad news .PERIOD <BREAK>
i traveled around the world ,COMMA entered different cultures ,COMMA wrote a series of books about my travels ,COMMA including walking the bible .PERIOD <BREAK>

my english lost ,COMMA i wanted to vomit .PERIOD <BREAK>
and actually ,COMMA over these <NUM> years ,COMMA there has been a very clear class system that also has emerged .PERIOD <BREAK>
that's the region where entropy is low .PERIOD <BREAK>
they are delicacies .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i absolutely love the periodic table .PERIOD <BREAK>
and a month into it ,COMMA i come to the office ,COMMA and i have this email from one of our students .PERIOD <BREAK>
so what actually works ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
thank you .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the second thing is that an ant's ability to assess this pattern must be very crude because no ant can do any sophisticated counting .PERIOD <BREAK>
it wasn't going anywhere toward ,COMMA you know ,COMMA saying what the gene was ;SEMICOLON it was just nuclear science .PERIOD and oh ,COMMA that's the book ,COMMA little book .PERIOD <BREAK>

if we do spring from a common source ,COMMA how did we come to occupy every corner of the globe ,COMMA and in the process generate all of this diversity ,COMMA the different ways of life ,COMMA the different appearances ,COMMA the different languages around the world ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
we never had a war ;SEMICOLON sweden was in peace all this time .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the reason why we were brought together was not because we shared an artistic style or a literary taste .PERIOD <BREAK>

america -- the world saw america as not being the leader in technology ,COMMA and that was a very strong thing .PERIOD <BREAK>

what can you do ?QUESTIONMARK you can personally get carbon neutral .PERIOD <BREAK>
you can talk about creationism -- which i think wouldn't go down well with this audience ,COMMA at least not from a view where you were a proponent of it -- or you can talk about optimisations ,COMMA spelled the british way ,COMMA with an s ,COMMA instead of a z .PERIOD <BREAK>
marijuana's too cheap ,COMMA it turns out .PERIOD <BREAK>
what are its kindred and component parts ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
so the <NUM> th century ,COMMA then ,COMMA saw how much more complex reality was ,COMMA but it also saw a positive side .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so let me list just a couple of the things i think this research points us toward trying to understand .PERIOD <BREAK>
deception ,COMMA it's a fundamental part of life .PERIOD <BREAK>
in a poet's mind ,COMMA it's a conflict of words ,COMMA in the universe's mind ,COMMA between day and night .PERIOD <BREAK>

and i had this captured market .PERIOD you didn't need contracts .PERIOD <BREAK>
we find this in every country we look at .PERIOD <BREAK>

there's a group right now in china called yeeyan .PERIOD <BREAK>
how can you make sense of this ?QUESTIONMARK well ,COMMA we believed -- and we hypothesized -- that one way animals could work simply ,COMMA is if the control of their movements tended to be built into their bodies themselves .PERIOD <BREAK>

this is a simulation that uses graphics ,COMMA but other people find motivating what money can buy ,COMMA not just numbers .PERIOD <BREAK>
and they clearly learned a lot from it because in the same district ,COMMA police review policy after children shocked :COLON <NUM> nd child shocked by taser stun gun within weeks .PERIOD <BREAK>
and one of the most interesting lessons i learned was that there is an experimental method that if you have a question you can create a replica of this question in some abstract way ,COMMA and you can try to examine this question ,COMMA maybe learn something about the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
and okolloh solicited from her commenters more information about what was going on .PERIOD <BREAK>

consider the fungi -- including mushrooms ,COMMA rusts ,COMMA molds and many disease-causing organisms .PERIOD <BREAK>
what we do is we take a fire hydrant ,COMMA a no parking space associated with a fire hydrant ,COMMA and we prescribe the removal of the asphalt to create an engineered micro landscape ,COMMA to create an infiltration opportunity .PERIOD <BREAK>
but human nature doesn't change ,COMMA mate .PERIOD <BREAK>

these images of bangladesh came out of a radio program i was listening to .PERIOD <BREAK>

this was a huge success for them because the imagery got shown in the press the day after in every single newspaper ,COMMA broadsheets and tabloids .PERIOD <BREAK>
that's the principle objective .PERIOD <BREAK>
then statistics would actually say that half of you would now be suffering with diarrhea .PERIOD <BREAK>
so what is time perspective ?QUESTIONMARK that's what i'm going to talk about today .PERIOD <BREAK>
well that's going to be a breeding ground for compassion .PERIOD <BREAK>
i visit her in the hospital .PERIOD <BREAK>
first of all ,COMMA worse nutrition ,COMMA maybe shorter life spans .PERIOD <BREAK>

and you'll notice that there's a very heavy bias towards north america and western europe .PERIOD <BREAK>
they are going to be cued these three square words :COLON like ,COMMA not and head .PERIOD <BREAK>
seismic standards and confined masonry ,COMMA where the building acts as a whole -- walls and columns and roofs and slabs tied together to support each other -- instead of breaking off into separate members and failing .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA our cell phones can now build a place history .PERIOD <BREAK>

and he's five years old .PERIOD <BREAK>
they digest our food ,COMMA they make our vitamins ,COMMA they actually educate your immune system to keep bad microbes out .PERIOD <BREAK>

and it was really moving .PERIOD and this picture here was taken the final night from a distant cliff about two miles away ,COMMA where the contents of the capsule were being beamed into space .PERIOD <BREAK>
and they are actually going to romanticize this moment in time .PERIOD <BREAK>

after all ,COMMA companies didn't stop polluting groundwater as a matter of course ,COMMA or employing <NUM> -year-olds as a matter of course ,COMMA just because executives woke up one day and decided it was the right thing to do .PERIOD <BREAK>
because we understand very little about most human diseases .PERIOD <BREAK>

i am no historian ,COMMA ladies and gentlemen .PERIOD <BREAK>
oh -- sorry i forgot .PERIOD <BREAK>
and where we have this gypsum strip they can harvest this water .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it's pushing the ecosystem close to collapse .PERIOD <BREAK>
but a multiple polarity of power means shifting and changing alliances .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so every time a new medium arrives ,COMMA the old medium is the content ,COMMA and it is highly observable ,COMMA highly noticeable ,COMMA but the real ,COMMA real roughing up and massaging is done by the new medium ,COMMA and it is ignored .PERIOD <BREAK>
now ,COMMA in keeping with today's theme ,COMMA i'd like to point out -- and something you already know -- that sometimes a small advantage someplace in life can yield tremendous results someplace else .PERIOD <BREAK>

how would you do it ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
all of the western religions begin with the notion of eden ,COMMA and descend through a kind of profligate present to a very ugly future .PERIOD <BREAK>

and so what happened -- and i think there will probably be some people in the audience that will identify with this -- i went to my first meeting ,COMMA first at the u .PERIOD n .PERIOD and that's when this all started ,COMMA because that is a very male organization .PERIOD <BREAK>
so it's anti-naturalistic really ,COMMA the up and down movement ,COMMA but it feels like breath .PERIOD <BREAK>
please put your hands up .PERIOD <BREAK>
if i said to you ,COMMA okay ,COMMA we're not going to have new ted .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's really pure flying .PERIOD <BREAK>

why do we care about that ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
there's tons of technology ,COMMA and the only piece of technology that i really want to talk about is xml .PERIOD <BREAK>

so i came together with a group of other people who were all looking at this issue ,COMMA and we created the plastic pollution coalition .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i testified to that inquiry in secret .PERIOD <BREAK>
in fact ,COMMA the availability of these data ,COMMA i think ,COMMA heralds a kind of new era of what i and others would like to call computational social science .PERIOD <BREAK>
what that will do is avoid the problem i was talking about earlier ,COMMA where currently we have political parties presenting democracy as merely a political choice in those societies alongside other choices such as military rule and theocracy .PERIOD <BREAK>
to make this a little bit more random ,COMMA let's take the fourth row this time ,COMMA let's say ,COMMA one ,COMMA two ,COMMA three ,COMMA four .PERIOD <BREAK>

you can see a few of them are swarming around the cursor right now .PERIOD <BREAK>

and that's the same with universal flu vaccine ,COMMA the same kind of thing ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
so at that time -- and i was <NUM> -- and i was listening to just radio ,COMMA and someone happened to sit next to me ,COMMA like these three people are sitting here .PERIOD <BREAK>
video games are not the cause .PERIOD <BREAK>
in canada ,COMMA five boys drop out for every three girls .PERIOD <BREAK>
he stepped back and he watched where everybody was going and he went the other way .PERIOD <BREAK>
he was mostly interested in ink bleaching .PERIOD <BREAK>
which leads me to a videotape of a president bush press conference from a couple of weeks ago .PERIOD <BREAK>
because i had them through <NUM> in my book ,COMMA the singularity is near .PERIOD <BREAK>
that was the first concept here .PERIOD <BREAK>
<NUM> .PERIOD <NUM> million americans suffer heart attacks yearly .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i got my daughter's barbie doll dish ,COMMA i put it right where a bunch of carpenter ants were making debris fields ,COMMA every day ,COMMA in my house ,COMMA and the ants were attracted to the mycelium ,COMMA because there's no spores .PERIOD <BREAK>
and somehow that seems wrong .PERIOD <BREAK>
but it turned out ,COMMA after i sent the works to her ,COMMA that her dad's friends ,COMMA like most of you ,COMMA are geeks .PERIOD <BREAK>
and in fact ,COMMA the typewriter was essentially deleted by this thing .PERIOD <BREAK>
and then they'd tow the sharks back to purteen harbor ,COMMA boil them up ,COMMA use the oil .PERIOD <BREAK>
i close with this song -- it's a children's song -- because we are all children at the table of mama eternal .PERIOD <BREAK>
if you are like <NUM> percent of other people ,COMMA you will identify the round ,COMMA amoeboid shape as bouba ,COMMA and the sharp ,COMMA spiky one as kiki .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so this is something that ,COMMA through research and education ,COMMA i believe that we can solve .PERIOD <BREAK>
finally ,COMMA i said ,COMMA why am i clapping ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
so it's very important to avoid inadvertent injury .PERIOD <BREAK>
why don't we try changing it every day ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
so we kept on going ,COMMA and this camel kept on trying to take a chunk out of my leg .PERIOD <BREAK>
if you don't know what those are ,COMMA they're just the brains .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i was there thinking about what was going on .PERIOD <BREAK>
there seems to be some truth in john donne's no man is an island .PERIOD <BREAK>
and although they vary enormously in scale ,COMMA maturity and purpose ,COMMA when we dived into them ,COMMA we realized that they could actually be organized into three clear systems .PERIOD <BREAK>
and they brought this kind of a jeweled parasol ,COMMA and they put it on the ground .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's really not that difficult .PERIOD <BREAK>
along the way ,COMMA you lost something .PERIOD <BREAK>
then what happens to the waste ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
you are joined by dozens of your israeli brothers and sisters .PERIOD <BREAK>
while this was all going on ,COMMA i was in the field of weather modification ,COMMA although getting a ph .PERIOD d .PERIOD in aeronautics .PERIOD <BREAK>

generically ,COMMA what we use the web for is to organize ,COMMA exchange ,COMMA create and consume information .PERIOD <BREAK>
let me focus a minute on the light vehicles ,COMMA the cars and light trucks ,COMMA because we all know the most about those ;SEMICOLON probably everybody here drives one .PERIOD <BREAK>
somebody said the test we're facing now ,COMMA a scientist told me ,COMMA is whether the combination of an opposable thumb and a neocortex is a viable combination .PERIOD <BREAK>
the child's native language is such a case is not english .PERIOD <BREAK>
when i said earlier ,COMMA to try and tell a story from the inside out ,COMMA versus the outside in -- part of what chris said so eloquently in his introduction -- is this melding .PERIOD <BREAK>
i tell them my story ,COMMA that i am hiv-positive ,COMMA but my child is hiv-negative .PERIOD <BREAK>
and with bad governance historically ,COMMA over the last <NUM> years ,COMMA it hasn't .PERIOD <BREAK>
so let me show you some of nature's patterns that are the result of this .PERIOD <BREAK>
and in this case ,COMMA a man got hooked on a bamboo sleeping mat .PERIOD <BREAK>
so that when it gets dark ,COMMA i've got plenty of power .PERIOD <BREAK>
ants are not known to occur in redwood trees ,COMMA curiously enough ,COMMA and we wondered whether this ant ,COMMA this species of ant ,COMMA was only endemic to that one tree ,COMMA or possibly to that grove .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is the library of human imagination .PERIOD <BREAK>
it can predict complex negotiations or situations involving coercion -- that is in essence everything that has to do with politics ,COMMA much of what has to do with business ,COMMA but sorry ,COMMA if you're looking to speculate in the stock market ,COMMA i don't predict stock markets -- ok ,COMMA it's not going up any time really soon .PERIOD <BREAK>
but people used to say to her ,COMMA why are you so miserable ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
it's easy to imagine how particularly those parts of our bodies were quickly influenced by selection from the environment and shifted frequencies of genes that are involved in them .PERIOD <BREAK>
but the other side of the equation is you've got to come out of your cave .PERIOD <BREAK>
what you see in this top drawing is a schematic of how petroleum gets used in the u .PERIOD s .PERIOD economy .PERIOD <BREAK>
so they copy each other .PERIOD they can count to five .PERIOD they can recognize faces .PERIOD <BREAK>
you can see the lhotse face is in profile ,COMMA it's about a <NUM> degree angle .PERIOD it takes two days to climb it ,COMMA so you put the camp halfway through .PERIOD <BREAK>
so just bear with me .PERIOD we'll go real fast ,COMMA you know ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and you can see that that has a mild prescription of about minus two diopters .PERIOD <BREAK>
they said ,COMMA we have a product that pauses live tv ,COMMA skips commercials ,COMMA rewinds live tv and memorizes your viewing habits without you even asking .PERIOD <BREAK>
what we really yearn for as human beings is to be visible to each other .PERIOD <BREAK>
the classrooms have no walls .PERIOD <BREAK>
i think something's going on there .PERIOD <BREAK>
comets are a tougher act .PERIOD <BREAK>
but ,COMMA actually ,COMMA the point of placebo education is interesting .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA my view of the health care worker of the future is not a doctor ,COMMA but is an <NUM> -year-old ,COMMA otherwise unemployed ,COMMA who has two things :COLON he has a backpack full of these tests ,COMMA and a lancet to occasionally take a blood sample ,COMMA and an ak- <NUM> .PERIOD <BREAK>

who's going to get enough out of the world ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
night shots are beautiful ,COMMA piercing the big dipper and the milky way .PERIOD <BREAK>
don't let milk spoil your morning .PERIOD <BREAK>
so that shows you that we have people who are capable of doing .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's their great calling right now ,COMMA to get people all around the world better at expanding their moral imaginations ,COMMA appreciating that in so many ways they're in the same boat .PERIOD <BREAK>
when the prestige sank off the coast of spain ,COMMA there were big ,COMMA floating cushions the size of sofa cushions of emulsified oil ,COMMA with the consistency ,COMMA or the viscosity ,COMMA of chewing gum .PERIOD <BREAK>
and he knew that it gives us a sense of trust ,COMMA and it allows us then to take the kind of creative risks that we need to take as designers .PERIOD <BREAK>
it tasted fine .PERIOD it tasted interesting .PERIOD <BREAK>
but then i went to the site and all of the audio in my site had been silenced .PERIOD <BREAK>
now we're experiencing one every week .PERIOD <BREAK>
one is because i'm pretty aggressive ,COMMA and i try and find ,COMMA you know ,COMMA opportunities .PERIOD <BREAK>
we had our mothers ,COMMA our aunts ,COMMA our cousins ,COMMA our sisters ,COMMA and of course ,COMMA the ever-present media bombarding us with images and words ,COMMA telling us how to be .PERIOD <BREAK>
fourteen years ago ,COMMA i searched for beauty in the traditional things ,COMMA in craft forms .PERIOD <BREAK>
these carriers of the weak force ,COMMA the zs ,COMMA the same .PERIOD <BREAK>
i'm seeing too many of these smart kids who haven't learned basic things ,COMMA like how to be on time .PERIOD <BREAK>
what's the capital structure up until this point ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
they give you <NUM> hours to finish this race .PERIOD <BREAK>
not for the bush ,COMMA but for the seeds .PERIOD <BREAK>
but there goes salmon sharks with this meter-level resolution on an ocean of temperature -- warm colors are warmer .PERIOD <BREAK>
we take their supply chain ,COMMA we take all the factory names ,COMMA we do a random sample ,COMMA we send inspectors on an unannounced basis to inspect those facilities ,COMMA and then we publish the results .PERIOD <BREAK>
consider the memory of long temporal sequences of movements ,COMMA like a pianist playing a beethoven sonata .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA thank you very much .PERIOD <BREAK>
why use triangles ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
would you like to close down the trial now ,COMMA or should we wait until we have robust results ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and the element helium was discovered just by staring at the light from the sun because some of those black lines were found that corresponded to no known element .PERIOD <BREAK>
the old stars ,COMMA they come to life .PERIOD <BREAK>
i don't know what it is .PERIOD i get asked in interviews a lot ,COMMA my god ,COMMA you're guitars are so gigantic !EXCLAMATIONMARK <BREAK>
you're down to a third of the speed ,COMMA a third of the power ,COMMA and a good bicyclist can put out that power ,COMMA and that worked ,COMMA and we won the prize a year later .PERIOD <BREAK>
we've got to focus on a personal healthcare paradigm that moves care to the home .PERIOD how do we be more proactive ,COMMA prevention-driven ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and the fiber fills you up before you get too many calories ,COMMA and it slows the absorption so you don’t get that rapid rise in blood sugar .PERIOD <BREAK>
am i going to draw it on the computer ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and that's the powerful men .PERIOD we have to meet and to talk to them .PERIOD <BREAK>
so now we have a complete living lamprey eel brain .PERIOD <BREAK>
now ,COMMA to say this is not to say that we have got the perfect solution in our own society .PERIOD <BREAK>
peace ,COMMA health ,COMMA serenity ,COMMA happiness ,COMMA nirvana .PERIOD <BREAK>
can we do a quick show of hands ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
that's bioprocessing ,COMMA you know ;SEMICOLON that's bio-assisted technology :COLON using an organism to do your wastewater treatment is an old ,COMMA old technology called domestication .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's possible to assume ,COMMA setting aside a possibility of catastrophe ,COMMA that sooner or later we will develop all of these .PERIOD <BREAK>
there's a revolution going on .PERIOD <BREAK>
when i did this one ,COMMA a gentleman seen it and said to me ,COMMA there's no way you can do this ,COMMA you must have used some kind of machine .PERIOD <BREAK>
i worked out recently that i was given a guitar as a kid at about the same time that eric clapton got his first guitar .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA you can see we matched them perfectly ,COMMA perfectly .PERIOD <BREAK>
they are voiceless ,COMMA [unclear] ,COMMA nameless people .PERIOD <BREAK>
the problem is that we're not programmed for longevity .PERIOD <BREAK>
and why are my people poor .PERIOD <BREAK>
in addition to accurate language training it also fixes memory and cognition speech fluency and speech production .PERIOD <BREAK>
when i press it again ,COMMA it'll chirp three times ,COMMA and that'll mean that it's armed and ready to go .PERIOD <BREAK>
instead ,COMMA they've become ,COMMA sadly ,COMMA uninspiring and uncreative organizations that rely so heavily on market research and polling and focus groups that they end up all saying the same thing ,COMMA pretty much regurgitating back to us what we already want to hear at the expense of putting forward bold and creative ideas .PERIOD <BREAK>
there's a good person .PERIOD <BREAK>
but they had a good question .PERIOD <BREAK>
but i'd want one that could play ,COMMA too .PERIOD <BREAK>
so the best editing gives us a bit of both .PERIOD <BREAK>
so i decided to slice these up with the tool that i make by -- i sharpen the end of a needle into a blade .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it's inside and outside ,COMMA self and other ,COMMA and other is all very different .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA this is sort of a comment on the time .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's taken over a wider geographic area .PERIOD <BREAK>
a couple of things to keep in mind when you see it ,COMMA it was built entirely by hand ,COMMA i think they got a crane the last year .PERIOD <BREAK>
but a subset of them will fire even when i watch somebody else being touched in the same location .PERIOD <BREAK>
so in <NUM> ,COMMA nicholas copernicus published the revolutions of heavenly spheres ,COMMA and by taking the earth out of the center ,COMMA and putting the sun in the center of the solar system ,COMMA he opened our eyes to a much larger universe ,COMMA of which we are just a small part .PERIOD <BREAK>
so he taught me that physics is cool because it teaches us so much about the world around us .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i said ,COMMA do you pray ?QUESTIONMARK when i looked at the group ,COMMA i said ,COMMA do you pray ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
all the joints are hand-carved and hand-scribed .PERIOD <BREAK>
still in clinical trials ,COMMA but imagine when we can connect these ,COMMA for example ,COMMA to the amazing bionic limb ,COMMA such as the deka arm built by dean kamen and colleagues ,COMMA which has <NUM> degrees of motion and freedom and can allow the person who's lost a limb to have much higher levels of dexterity or control than they've had in the past .PERIOD <BREAK>
now we have really made use of this ,COMMA and we have tried to squeeze a lot of data into the system .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is an actual group of people that sit around naming planetary objects .PERIOD <BREAK>
i've taken one shot ;SEMICOLON i cropped it a few different ways .PERIOD <BREAK>
and one of the the cutting-edge areas that we're just incredibly excited about is stem cell therapy .PERIOD <BREAK>
we have a process where we ,COMMA you know ,COMMA kind of put it into the computer and digitize it ,COMMA and then a whole lot of analysis .PERIOD <BREAK>
let's see chris's program throughout the rest of the show .PERIOD okay ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and i was just fucking furious ,COMMA furious .PERIOD ok ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
the second is more than <NUM> percent of the weight of a vehicle is in propellant .PERIOD <BREAK>
i became a parent .PERIOD <BREAK>
many prototypes crashed -- many .PERIOD <BREAK>
fall down nine times ,COMMA get up <NUM> .PERIOD <BREAK>
and yet ,COMMA in many places ,COMMA a third of the children ,COMMA by the time they're three already are facing a life of hardship due to this .PERIOD <BREAK>
metaphor is not just the detection of patterns ;SEMICOLON it is the creation of patterns .PERIOD <BREAK>
the story that i like to end with is this .PERIOD it comes out of a place called the gallup organization .PERIOD <BREAK>
what happened actually when dunbar kind of looked at the tape is that ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA almost all of the important breakthrough ideas did not happen alone in the lab ,COMMA in front of the microscope .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA for example ,COMMA here's a word puzzle .PERIOD <BREAK>
so if we go and look at this piece of content ,COMMA president obama's state of the union address from just a few weeks ago ,COMMA and look at what we find in this same data set ,COMMA at the same scale ,COMMA the engagement properties of this piece of content are truly remarkable .PERIOD <BREAK>
three tunas tagged .PERIOD <BREAK>
but for me ,COMMA it doesn't .PERIOD that is a wonderful thing .PERIOD <BREAK>
they only get the food that drops from the sky ,COMMA from the u .PERIOD n .PERIOD <BREAK>
but there's actually more to the story than that .PERIOD <BREAK>
and what happens when we moved on ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
no ,COMMA because a widely shared design practice doesn't necessarily give you a unity of culture -- and it definitely is not in the dna .PERIOD <BREAK>
over on the left-hand side ,COMMA you will notice fuel consumption decreasing as the rocket takes off .PERIOD <BREAK>
and our joy of music ,COMMA etc .PERIOD etc .PERIOD <BREAK>
of course ,COMMA the main goal of this project is to develop a car for the blind .PERIOD <BREAK>
so if christian played a note -- like play an f .PERIOD <BREAK>
self-organizing systems also always show emergence ,COMMA which is that the system starts to do things ,COMMA which it was never designed for .PERIOD <BREAK>
he would definitely say ,COMMA god came down from heaven ,COMMA and he said unto the cow ,COMMA 'thou shalt cross the road .PERIOD ' and cow crossed the road ,COMMA and there was much rejoicing as a holy cow .PERIOD <BREAK>
it branches on more the experimental side .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA in order to really create a full image ,COMMA i had to honor the perspectives on the right-hand side and at the same time ,COMMA uncomfortably recognize how many of those qualities were actually in me ,COMMA which was very ,COMMA very annoying and uncomfortable .PERIOD <BREAK>
so on top of l-dopa ,COMMA they gave these kids a serotonin precursor drug ,COMMA and they're effectively normal now .PERIOD <BREAK>
in order to concentrate sunlight ,COMMA they have to have lenses and mirrors -- in order to keep themselves warm .PERIOD <BREAK>
and they invested in social programs -- health and education .PERIOD <BREAK>
and those vistas will both create new science ,COMMA and fundamental change in the world as we see it ,COMMA in the next hundred years .PERIOD <BREAK>
and they're not very emotional ;SEMICOLON they solve a purpose ;SEMICOLON and certainly automobiles have been around for <NUM> years and have made our lives functionally a lot better in many ways ;SEMICOLON they've also been a real pain in the ass ,COMMA because automobiles are really the thing we have to solve .PERIOD <BREAK>
and one of the things that i've been thinking about recently is what is worth while .PERIOD <BREAK>
from the moment of birth ,COMMA the baby responds most to the voice of the person who is most likely to care for it -- its mother .PERIOD <BREAK>
it was really great when it started to break up all of the curatorial text .PERIOD <BREAK>
one of the students asked a question that just warmed my heart .PERIOD <BREAK>
return of fish men .PERIOD <BREAK>
all the movements stopped at falsifying .PERIOD <BREAK>
the great thing about our leaders is that ,COMMA should they not only have passion in their belly ,COMMA which practically all of them have ,COMMA they're also very innovative .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it’s one of those things that came out of the silence ,COMMA the listening to each other .PERIOD <BREAK>
so we can now ,COMMA in a matter of hours ,COMMA determine a whole human genome .PERIOD <BREAK>
i'm going to give you some examples .PERIOD <BREAK>
i'm a big list maker ,COMMA so i came up with a list .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i still remember the first cases where they came ,COMMA all <NUM> together ,COMMA she would stand up ,COMMA and they were in the back ,COMMA and they would support her ,COMMA and the judges kept saying ,COMMA no ,COMMA no ,COMMA no ,COMMA no ,COMMA we're going to do things the exact same way we've been doing them .PERIOD <BREAK>
we need new tools and new approaches .PERIOD <BREAK>
now can it be right to reject a student on linguistic ability alone ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
that it's about communication that doesn't just produce greater understanding within the individual ,COMMA but leads to real change .PERIOD <BREAK>
but she helped organize people ,COMMA and helped turn it into a movement .PERIOD <BREAK>
they allow us to sublimate into the culture of interactive ,COMMA downloaded ,COMMA streaming ,COMMA hd reality .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's from the senate .PERIOD <BREAK>
there is a unique opportunity now with focused ultrasound guided by mr ,COMMA because we can actually think about prostate lumpectomy -- treating just the focal lesion and not removing the whole gland ,COMMA and by that ,COMMA avoiding all the issues with potency and incontinence .PERIOD <BREAK>
and you need to re-set it up .PERIOD <BREAK>
and now it's got a hangover .PERIOD <BREAK>
and then he said ,COMMA what you do for the least of these ,COMMA you do for me .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA a moment ,COMMA how would you define a moment ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
so ,COMMA my kind of hero for this in the natural world are these tropical frogs .PERIOD <BREAK>
we've changed fema guidelines .PERIOD we've changed public policy .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i drew it out for her .PERIOD <BREAK>
i find it helps actually to look at the dump trucks that move the earth ,COMMA the largest ever built .PERIOD <BREAK>
the first drawback is that it turns out the pleasant life ,COMMA your experience of positive emotion ,COMMA is heritable ,COMMA about <NUM> percent heritable ,COMMA and ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA not very modifiable .PERIOD <BREAK>
this photo was taken before the great depression in brazzaville ,COMMA congo .PERIOD <BREAK>
a god who looks after his own ,COMMA so that christians are ok ,COMMA while everyone else perishes ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and it includes exercises that show you not just how to solve these puzzles ,COMMA but how to extract the principles that will let you solve mathematical puzzles or problems in science ,COMMA other areas .PERIOD <BREAK>
it turns out ,COMMA merely watching a romantic comedy causes relationship satisfaction to plummet .PERIOD <BREAK>
we are more than simply national symbols of urban blight .PERIOD <BREAK>
because the whole business of actually suggesting that someone is breaking the law and then gathering evidence and proving that ,COMMA that turns out to be really inconvenient .PERIOD <BREAK>
so we can do that here -- we can just put in a little search term .PERIOD <BREAK>
they put it in a little tiny glass jar ,COMMA with a wonderful enameled label on it ,COMMA made it look french ,COMMA even though it's made in oxnard ,COMMA california .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the hot air engine also was not invented by robert stirling ,COMMA but robert stirling came along in <NUM> and radically improved it .PERIOD <BREAK>
so it turned out that this was a very productive time in gene therapy ,COMMA and lots of viruses were coming along .PERIOD <BREAK>
in our world we use about <NUM> polymers to make all this .PERIOD <BREAK>
i call this groundswell collaborative consumption .PERIOD <BREAK>
imagine a world full of brains and far more memes than can possibly find homes .PERIOD <BREAK>
and one of the key points in the science of happiness is that happiness and unhappiness are not endpoints of a single continuum .PERIOD <BREAK>
that's so true .PERIOD <BREAK>
so much has that happened that i've developed a fairly praticed response ,COMMA which is :COLON i point out that first of all ,COMMA you have to understand that there is no such thing as an inauthentic experience .PERIOD <BREAK>
my own theory of success -- and i'm somebody who is very interested in success .PERIOD i really want to be successful .PERIOD <BREAK>
and this is nasa's view .PERIOD they're stunningly similar .PERIOD <BREAK>
communal value on the networks we have is everywhere -- every time you see a large aggregate of shared ,COMMA publicly available data ,COMMA whether it's photos on flickr or videos on youtube or whatever .PERIOD <BREAK>
you get hints ,COMMA the actual steps for that problem ,COMMA if you don't know how to do it .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so what we do is we buy these drills that have a potential capacity of thousands of hours of drill time ,COMMA use them once or twice to put a hole in the wall and let them sit .PERIOD <BREAK>
now there are things that we can do in the future .PERIOD <BREAK>
metaphorical thinking is essential to how we understand ourselves and others ,COMMA how we communicate ,COMMA learn ,COMMA discover and invent .PERIOD <BREAK>
so this movement ,COMMA if it's to be durable and global ,COMMA will have to cross borders ,COMMA and you will have to see other citizens in democracies ,COMMA not simply resting on the assumption that their government would do something in the face of genocide ,COMMA but actually making it such .PERIOD <BREAK>
and you repeat that process over and over again ,COMMA until you have something that walks -- in this case ,COMMA in a straight line ,COMMA like this .PERIOD <BREAK>
i need some information ,COMMA and i need a container .PERIOD <BREAK>
that's where you take a gene out of one animal and stick it in another one .PERIOD <BREAK>
uganda :COLON the new forest company ,COMMA replanting and redeveloping their forests .PERIOD why is that important ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
before that has to come to be a mildly bad robot ,COMMA and before that a not so bad robot .PERIOD <BREAK>
no ,COMMA shut up !EXCLAMATIONMARK <BREAK>
and in this way ,COMMA the way that e <NUM> comes in is it will be as a shape that's attached at each point in space-time .PERIOD <BREAK>
i was gasping for air .PERIOD <BREAK>
when the molecule increases to a certain amount -- which says something about the number of cells -- it locks down into that receptor and information comes into the cells that tells the cells to turn on this collective behavior of making light .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is a story on the yacht club that's all basically blue collar .PERIOD <BREAK>
and this was the result of the tragic loss of lives of people who could not get into them .PERIOD <BREAK>
but every single thing that makes us ,COMMA every atom in us ,COMMA has already created a myriad of different things and will go on to create a myriad of new things .PERIOD <BREAK>
<NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> were heavy years for me for another reason ,COMMA too .PERIOD <BREAK>
like a lot of predators ,COMMA they walk on their toes .PERIOD <BREAK>
the information they get gets filtered through somebody who either twists that information ,COMMA or colors that information ,COMMA does something with it .PERIOD <BREAK>
now we did purchase a vaccine ,COMMA you've probably all heard about it ,COMMA made by sanofi-aventis .PERIOD <BREAK>
i'm not even telling you the story because i think we should be running more carefully controlled randomized trials in all aspects of public policy ,COMMA although i think that would also be completely awesome .PERIOD <BREAK>
so i'm going to take you through ,COMMA perhaps push you a little bit mathematically -- so brace yourselves -- push you a little bit to understand how this language works ,COMMA which enables us to capture what is symmetry .PERIOD <BREAK>
if you ask what kind of a situation is conducive to people becoming friends and allies ,COMMA the technical answer is a non-zero-sum situation .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA i think the most important question at the end is ,COMMA what do we actually learn from specimens like this and from our past in general ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
it's to have a look at different worlds .PERIOD <BREAK>
he's had that arm for about <NUM> months ,COMMA so he's pretty good with it .PERIOD <BREAK>
but it’s hard to break our habits ,COMMA our adult habits .PERIOD <BREAK>
however ,COMMA we've discovered that there's actually no straightforward mechanism to develop a molecule for one-time use .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's about getting a spacecraft that's hurtling through deep space and using all this bag of tricks to somehow figure out how to get it down to the surface of mars at zero miles an hour .PERIOD <BREAK>
when they do do intentional physical activity ,COMMA it's the things they enjoy .PERIOD they tend to walk ,COMMA the only proven way to stave off cognitive decline ,COMMA and they all tend to have a garden .PERIOD <BREAK>
the other place that is sort of supporting our dependence on oil and our increased consumption is the gulf of mexico ,COMMA which was not part of the moratoriums .PERIOD <BREAK>
it can only be a state of being ,COMMA not just a fleeting emotion ,COMMA sensation .PERIOD <BREAK>
i said ,COMMA in exchange for education in how to paint ,COMMA i will support them ,COMMA and i started a company .PERIOD <BREAK>
prime minister ,COMMA i think there are many in the audience who are truly appreciative of the efforts you made in terms of the financial mess we got ourselves into .PERIOD <BREAK>
i want to write about a tornado that comes into our house and blows all the windows out and ruins all the furniture and kills everybody .PERIOD <BREAK>
so foraging acts as a sink ,COMMA and the ants inside the nest act as a source .PERIOD <BREAK>
alisa volkman :COLON so this is where our story begins -- the dramatic moments of the birth of our first son ,COMMA declan .PERIOD <BREAK>
what we see around us is staggering complexity .PERIOD <BREAK>
a destroyed tank belonging to somoza's national guard was left as a monument in a park in managua ,COMMA and was transformed by the energy and spirit of a child .PERIOD <BREAK>
her mother ,COMMA that's right .PERIOD <BREAK>
and by the matrix ,COMMA i mean literally the matrix ,COMMA like the movie the matrix .PERIOD <BREAK>
now investment constitutes only about a fifth of the national income in most modern economies ,COMMA but it plays an absolutely vital role .PERIOD <BREAK>
but i found that there were some advantages to being in hollywood .PERIOD <BREAK>
but over the course of the next <NUM> years he had <NUM> more operations ,COMMA as the disease ravaged his face and destroyed my reconstruction regularly .PERIOD <BREAK>
or to use the technical term for it ,COMMA there's one born every minute .PERIOD <BREAK>
thank you very much .PERIOD <BREAK>
i'm going to present three projects in rapid fire .PERIOD <BREAK>
and these are the data .PERIOD <BREAK>
their competitors are all equally qualified to make all of these products .PERIOD <BREAK>
then after we harvest a coral ,COMMA we measure this ratio ,COMMA and now you can see ,COMMA those curves match perfectly .PERIOD <BREAK>
and their response ,COMMA of course ,COMMA was no more than we wanted to stop the genocide and put our troops in harm's way to do that ,COMMA nor do we now want to get in the way and pluck genocidaires from camps .PERIOD <BREAK>
she's nude .PERIOD <BREAK>
on a random visit to tesla on some afternoon ,COMMA i actually found out that the answer comes from separating between the car ownership and the battery ownership .PERIOD <BREAK>
you've got to dig a hole that's usually quite a bit bigger than that to get it out ;SEMICOLON you've got to climb those cliffs and find ,COMMA really ,COMMA everything that existed -- not just the dinosaurs ,COMMA but the entire story .PERIOD if you're lucky ,COMMA and you dig a place like that ,COMMA you actually find the ash bed to dig it ,COMMA and we did .PERIOD <BREAK>
open your eyes ,COMMA ezra .PERIOD <BREAK>
really ,COMMA this is more about putting the player in the role of george lucas ,COMMA you know ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
i teared up and i said that's where i want to be .PERIOD <BREAK>
that is where you fake .PERIOD <BREAK>
and no matter how many land mines erupt in a minute ,COMMA be sure your mind lands on the beauty of this funny place called life .PERIOD <BREAK>
it would be ridiculous to claim that we know how we make consciousness in our brains ,COMMA but we certainly can begin to approach the question ,COMMA and we can begin to see the shape of a solution .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the kind of social network i'm talking about is not the recent online variety ,COMMA but rather ,COMMA the kind of social networks that human beings have been assembling for hundreds of thousands of years ,COMMA ever since we emerged from the african savannah .PERIOD <BREAK>
interviewer :COLON this much ?QUESTIONMARK boy :COLON yeah .PERIOD <BREAK>
our imagination might shrink ;SEMICOLON our hearts might dwindle ,COMMA and our humanness might wither if we stay for too long inside our cultural cocoons .PERIOD <BREAK>
so the black and white photo shows the simple <NUM> 's strip shopping center .PERIOD <BREAK>
imagine being able to create a shape on the outside of a surface ,COMMA so that it's self-cleaning with just water .PERIOD that's what a leaf does .PERIOD <BREAK>
you think that i'm looking at that ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
at any rate ,COMMA at one point my brother-in-law ,COMMA leonard ,COMMA decided to write a book about a serial killer .PERIOD <BREAK>
i don't think that whether or not you're getting a compliment should be the test of something's value ,COMMA but i think in the case of a fashion item ,COMMA an article of clothing ,COMMA that's a reasonable benchmark .PERIOD <BREAK>
and as you translate them ,COMMA and as you see how other people translate them ,COMMA you start learning the language .PERIOD <BREAK>

that's all the eurotrash coming through jfk customs .PERIOD <BREAK>
he was a souvenir salesman who always wanted to be a painter ,COMMA and i was frankie p .PERIOD toronto .PERIOD <BREAK>

so i rammed through life as only a casey can do .PERIOD <BREAK>
sort of like the spinal tap scene where you get the tiny little stonehenge ,COMMA i guess ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>

it sounds like a lot ,COMMA but it is literally <NUM> minutes of what we're spending in iraq -- we're spending <NUM> billion dollars a month ;SEMICOLON <NUM> minutes is <NUM> million dollars -- so this is actually cheap .PERIOD <BREAK>
there are many usages of this data ,COMMA but the bottom line is that the historical record is being digitized .PERIOD <BREAK>
but how we work on jawbone is really unique .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is actually quite meaningful to me ,COMMA because car designers tend to be a little bit low on the totem pole -- we don't do coffee table books with just one lamp inside of it -- and cars are thought so much as a product that it's a little bit difficult to get into the aesthetic side under the same sort of terminology that one would discuss art .PERIOD <BREAK>

it was an evening dive .PERIOD <BREAK>
on a good night ,COMMA i think my best ever was <NUM> miles in the right direction .PERIOD <BREAK>
so it was a very daunting task for us to do a brand-new building that could keep the -- be a pristine building ,COMMA but keep this kind of experimental nature .PERIOD <BREAK>

but do you know what the crucial thing is ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
you're worming your way through branches which are crowded with living things that don't occur near the ground .PERIOD <BREAK>
to us ,COMMA when we look at a redwood tree ,COMMA it seems to be motionless and still ,COMMA and yet redwoods are constantly in motion ,COMMA moving upward into space ,COMMA articulating themselves and filling redwood space over redwood time ,COMMA over thousands of years .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i think by leveraging these sorts of technologies ,COMMA we're going to change the definition of disability to in some cases be superability ,COMMA or super-enabling .PERIOD <BREAK>
we would have no pains ,COMMA but also no joys .PERIOD <BREAK>
but that's not what an ideal leader is like now .PERIOD <BREAK>
he said what scientists do when a paradigm fails is ,COMMA guess what -- they carry on as if nothing had happened .PERIOD <BREAK>
another way of putting it is ,COMMA is there some humongous problem that we cannot yet get computers to solve ,COMMA yet we can split into tiny <NUM> -second chunks such that each time somebody solves a captcha they solve a little bit of this problem ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and that's when i got a story idea :COLON i want to go to antarctica ,COMMA get in the water with as many leopard seals as i possibly can and give them a fair shake -- find out if they really are these vicious animals ,COMMA or if they're misunderstood .PERIOD <BREAK>
i was here ,COMMA planting my chunks ,COMMA cutting up potatoes and planting it ,COMMA and the bees were working on this tree ;SEMICOLON bumblebees ,COMMA just making this thing vibrate .PERIOD <BREAK>
and then finally ,COMMA i want to show you some responses that we recorded with the world's first deep-sea webcam ,COMMA which we had installed in monterey canyon last year .PERIOD <BREAK>
i could relate to this homo erectus skeleton very well ,COMMA because i was the same age that he was when he died .PERIOD <BREAK>
and of course ,COMMA there's been economic growth in the west .PERIOD <BREAK>
my students often ask me ,COMMA what is sociology ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
a billion of us are obese ,COMMA while a further billion starve .PERIOD <BREAK>
so we've been studying the babies using a technique that we're using all over the world and the sounds of all languages .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so you just keep the glider positioned in that up current .PERIOD <BREAK>
now ,COMMA what causes this ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and they grow to be about this size .PERIOD <BREAK>
so what i’m going to do is ,COMMA i’m going to give you minute ,COMMA and i want you to adapt as many of those circles as you can into objects of some form .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is the media landscape as we knew it in the <NUM> th century .PERIOD <BREAK>
i'm going to abandon them now and walk back outside .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's been hypothesized that orb-weaving spiders ,COMMA like this argiope here ,COMMA should have the toughest dragline silks because they must intercept flying prey .PERIOD <BREAK>
cut .PERIOD cut .PERIOD that won't do .PERIOD <BREAK>
and we have to duke it out every day ,COMMA so we resort to politics .PERIOD <BREAK>
the different frequencies produce the different particles .PERIOD <BREAK>
and here i've taken away the robots ,COMMA but basically people move with their right arm sinusoidally back and forward .PERIOD <BREAK>
or is it an imitation of one half the set of sounds we make to express disappointment ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
from the entrance ,COMMA this is nothing like a commercial cave .PERIOD <BREAK>
i had one of my greatest players that you probably heard of ,COMMA bill walton .PERIOD he came to catch the bus ;SEMICOLON we were leaving for somewhere to play .PERIOD <BREAK>
well ,COMMA that's kind of an obvious statement up there .PERIOD <BREAK>
but tod couldn't come and the project is sort of somewhere ,COMMA i'm not sure whether it's happening the way we thought ,COMMA or not .PERIOD <BREAK>
and if we look where the income ends up -- the income -- this is <NUM> percent the world's annual income .PERIOD and the richest <NUM> percent ,COMMA they take out of that about <NUM> percent .PERIOD and the poorest <NUM> percent ,COMMA they take about two percent .PERIOD and this shows that the concept of developing countries is extremely doubtful .PERIOD we think about aid ,COMMA like these people here giving aid to these people here .PERIOD but in the middle ,COMMA we have most the world population ,COMMA and they have now <NUM> percent of the income .PERIOD <BREAK>
so it's not in our nature to pre-act .PERIOD <BREAK>
in fanning island ,COMMA the corals are not recovered .PERIOD <BREAK>
robot :COLON oh ,COMMA cool .PERIOD <BREAK>
they are culturally invisible .PERIOD we do not make movies about these .PERIOD <BREAK>
and eventually ,COMMA three miles later ,COMMA we arrived at our destination ,COMMA where a jeep was supposed to meet us .PERIOD <BREAK>
before lifesaver ,COMMA the best hand filters were only capable of filtering down to about <NUM> nanometers .PERIOD <BREAK>
and this is one reason that modes of transportation tend to be extremely glamorous .PERIOD <BREAK>
he would know where things would fit in the sky .PERIOD <BREAK>
now notice ,COMMA he nodded there ,COMMA he was giving me some indication he was understanding the flow of communication .PERIOD <BREAK>
because each and every day at our recycling plants around the world we handle about one million pounds of people's discarded stuff .PERIOD <BREAK>
saidullah sahib is an amazing man .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the price of electric miles ends up being a very interesting number .PERIOD <BREAK>
and in particular ,COMMA the people who made this expensive solution were very upset because they thought ,COMMA how can we hope to compete with something that's essentially free ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
that's why ,COMMA i'm trying to say ,COMMA it's like metro-nizing the bus .PERIOD <BREAK>
this young girl and her friend that i met in an orphanage in delhi were hiv positive from a syringe .PERIOD <BREAK>
now i remember that term really well for two reasons .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so we have to understand not only why tech's important ,COMMA where it's going ,COMMA but also ,COMMA very importantly ,COMMA when -- the timing is everything .PERIOD <BREAK>
they put all their heads together and they decided that there was nothing that could be done for this surgeon who had essentially separated himself from the world ,COMMA who by that time had become so overwhelmed ,COMMA not just with depression and feelings of worthlessness and inadequacy ,COMMA but with obsessional thinking ,COMMA obsessional thinking about coincidences .PERIOD <BREAK>
fortunately ,COMMA we have some examples .PERIOD <BREAK>
that was another thing that really touched me .PERIOD <BREAK>
this single story of africa ultimately comes ,COMMA i think ,COMMA from western literature .PERIOD <BREAK>
comic books .PERIOD quantum physics video games .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i started across the hall in north carolina ,COMMA because i thought it was probably a canaletto ,COMMA and would have all that in detail .PERIOD <BREAK>

masters and johnson :COLON now we're moving forward to the <NUM> s .PERIOD <BREAK>
to be new at ted -- it's like being the last high-school virgin .PERIOD <BREAK>

so i turned to the teeming small creatures that can be held between the thumb and forefinger :COLON the little things that compose the foundation of our ecosystems ,COMMA the little things ,COMMA as i like to say ,COMMA who run the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
and these are two projections from the world .PERIOD <BREAK>

and ,COMMA sadly ,COMMA i don't think we'll have time for you to meet everybody i brought ,COMMA but -- i'm trying to behave myself ,COMMA it's my first time here .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i think that all of us in this room ,COMMA as you move design forward ,COMMA it's not about just doing one thing .PERIOD <BREAK>
three years of dirty energy with not many jobs ,COMMA or centuries of clean energy with the potential for developing expertise and improvements in efficiency based on technical skills ,COMMA and developing local knowledge about how to get the most out of that region's wind .PERIOD <BREAK>
jewish man with family in the occupied territory ,COMMA someone in new york who would have died if he was at work that day ,COMMA and this man who wanted to be a terrorist and made it very clear .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA as you can see evidenced by such examples ,COMMA age has absolutely nothing to do with it .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA that's basically very simplistic technology of how this works .PERIOD <BREAK>
so we're targeting <NUM> dollars in <NUM> .PERIOD <BREAK>
so take for instance a gleam of happiness .PERIOD <BREAK>

they're really high resolution ,COMMA and they're really showing us what we can do with standard graphics cards today .PERIOD <BREAK>
we know ,COMMA and i know from my own experience ,COMMA that amazing things can happen ,COMMA when individuals and societies come together to change their future .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is a railway station the likes of which you've never seen before .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the way they represent information is they break up that data into little pieces that are represented by pulses and different neurons .PERIOD <BREAK>
i also want you to think of his name .PERIOD look at me and think of his name .PERIOD <BREAK>
another thing is sometimes science leads to really big societal benefits and technologies ,COMMA or businesses ,COMMA or whatever ,COMMA that come out of it .PERIOD and this is one ,COMMA too ,COMMA because when we understand how brains work ,COMMA we're going to be able to build intelligent machines ,COMMA and i think that's actually a good thing on the whole ,COMMA and it's going to have tremendous benefits to society ,COMMA just like a fundamental technology .PERIOD <BREAK>
whether in this audience or people elsewhere in the world ,COMMA hearing some of this ,COMMA may well be doing the screaming-with-rage thing ,COMMA after as well ,COMMA some of them .PERIOD <BREAK>
we really hate it when we have to lose out on some money .PERIOD <BREAK>
when palestinian and israeli politicians talk ,COMMA they usually don't listen to each other ,COMMA but a palestinian reader still reads a novel by a jewish author ,COMMA and vice versa ,COMMA connecting and empathizing with the narrator .PERIOD <BREAK>
so you may be wondering :COLON these are beautiful laboratory experiments ,COMMA do they really apply to real life ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
so i'd like to play this video .PERIOD <BREAK>
we didn't fly it into the pacific .PERIOD <BREAK>
where there is this much legal smoke ,COMMA there is likely to be some fire .PERIOD <BREAK>

this whole idea of sharing ,COMMA the idea of constituting reality by overlapping what i say and what you say -- think of a movie .PERIOD <BREAK>
everything seems to have gone fine .PERIOD <BREAK>
he's looking for those genes as well .PERIOD <BREAK>
what happens ?QUESTIONMARK they give better service -- not worse ,COMMA but better .PERIOD <BREAK>
and gail and gene did the complete opposite .PERIOD <BREAK>
we're not doing that at any scale on governance .PERIOD <BREAK>
good plan .PERIOD <BREAK>
at that time ,COMMA a large amount of money had come into newcastle university to improve schooling in india .PERIOD <BREAK>
we experience the world through a sequence of patterns ,COMMA and we store them ,COMMA and we recall them .PERIOD and when we recall them ,COMMA we match them up against reality ,COMMA and we're making predictions all the time .PERIOD <BREAK>
when i married my wife ,COMMA i promised her that i would listen to her every day as if for the first time .PERIOD <BREAK>

and as that's happened ,COMMA people have been leaving behind footprints ,COMMA footprints that tell stories of their moments of self-expression .PERIOD <BREAK>
alvaro siza grew up and lived in portugal and is probably considered the portuguese main guy in architecture .PERIOD <BREAK>

and i got the opportunity to start working with this community at that point ,COMMA and started developing ,COMMA really ,COMMA and mentoring them in terms of scale ,COMMA in terms of the design .PERIOD <BREAK>

people confuse ,COMMA in my view ,COMMA the order of the invention of the tools with the order in which they should use them for teaching .PERIOD <BREAK>
they make a lot of money .PERIOD <BREAK>

that was the origin of the word bug .PERIOD <BREAK>
our first school was on a rooftop of a building inside the slums ,COMMA a second story building ,COMMA the only second story building inside the slums .PERIOD <BREAK>

keith barry :COLON kathryn ,COMMA it's keith here .PERIOD i'm going to take you to a secret location ,COMMA ok ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>

i remember standing on the roof of the ministry of justice in downtown port-au-prince .PERIOD <BREAK>
they sort of say the harsh news ,COMMA that we are facing the largest transformative development since the industrialization .PERIOD <BREAK>
and since i'm realistic ,COMMA rather than grandiose ,COMMA i don't claim that the ability to control the function of the nervous system will at once unravel all its mysteries .PERIOD <BREAK>
but my example of it is a sign that i saw in a jewelry store .PERIOD <BREAK>
well ,COMMA thank you .PERIOD <BREAK>
do you think a lot of classes next school year should try this thing out ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
so i'm drawn on .PERIOD it's not too easy ,COMMA not too difficult .PERIOD <BREAK>
i'm not sure what these people think ,COMMA because i don't speak norsk .PERIOD <BREAK>
and richard meier ,COMMA who was one of my teachers ,COMMA kept coming over to my desk to give me criticism ,COMMA and he would say ,COMMA bill ,COMMA you've got to understand- -- solar energy has nothing to do with architecture .PERIOD <BREAK>
so we sell 'em ,COMMA and then something weird had been happening with the stores .PERIOD the store ,COMMA actually -- even though we started out as just a gag -- the store actually made money .PERIOD <BREAK>
if you look at management theory these days ,COMMA it used to be that our ideal leader sounded something like general patton ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
faces of all kinds are easy to see .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA can we improve that ?QUESTIONMARK well the idea is we take this device that i'm wearing ,COMMA and we put it on <NUM> patients with heart failure ,COMMA randomly assigned ,COMMA versus <NUM> patients who don't have active monitoring ,COMMA and see whether we can reduce heart failure readmissions ,COMMA and that's exciting .PERIOD and we'll start that trial ,COMMA and you'll hear more about how we're going to do that ,COMMA but that's a type of wireless device trial that could change medicine in the years ahead .PERIOD <BREAK>
that is where you come in .PERIOD <BREAK>
the learner could be middle-aged ,COMMA could be as young as <NUM> .PERIOD <BREAK>

now there is an epidemic of obesity :COLON two-thirds of adults and <NUM> percent of kids .PERIOD what's really concerning to me is that diabetes has increased <NUM> percent in the past <NUM> years ,COMMA and this may be the first generation in which our kids live a shorter life span than we do .PERIOD that's pitiful ,COMMA and it's preventable .PERIOD <BREAK>

if you dress it up with atoms ,COMMA hydrogen atoms -- that’s what it looks like when you have it on your computer -- but actually it’s sort of more like this ,COMMA in the sense that the atoms have a certain sphere that you cannot penetrate .PERIOD they repel .PERIOD <BREAK>

a real gun at a few feet's distance .PERIOD <BREAK>

humans ,COMMA livestock and pets are ,COMMA now ,COMMA <NUM> percent of the total world's mass of vertebrates on land and air .PERIOD <BREAK>
think about that for a minute .PERIOD <BREAK>

in fact ,COMMA the greatest wealth .PERIOD if you think about these other asteroids ,COMMA there's a class of the nickel iron ,COMMA which in platinum-group metal markets alone are worth something like <NUM> trillion dollars ,COMMA if you can go out and grab one of these rocks .PERIOD <BREAK>

thank you very much .PERIOD <BREAK>
and then back to the states to recuperate at veterans' hospitals ,COMMA such as here in walter reed .PERIOD <BREAK>

and it goes on and on .PERIOD <BREAK>
some of these economies were ruled by authoritarian governments in the <NUM> s and <NUM> s and <NUM> s .PERIOD <BREAK>
you can swallow this completely integrated device .PERIOD <BREAK>

information technology progresses through a series of s-curves where each one is a different paradigm .PERIOD <BREAK>

most of them have korsakoff's syndrome ,COMMA a polyneuritic psychosis that -- they drank way too much ,COMMA and they can't make new memories .PERIOD <BREAK>

in failing states ,COMMA genocidal states ,COMMA under-governed states ,COMMA precisely the kinds of places that threats to this country exist on the horizon ,COMMA and precisely the kinds of places where most of the world's suffering tends to get concentrated .PERIOD <BREAK>

well ,COMMA the way we've come up with uses computers but doesn't depend on them .PERIOD <BREAK>
that's exactly why i asked the question .PERIOD <BREAK>
well ,COMMA nothing would happen because i'm not a physicist ;SEMICOLON i don't understand string theory .PERIOD <BREAK>
but here is that same girl who is implanted now .PERIOD <BREAK>
and they will step up .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is paldin .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so what i love about this story is that rosey grier is just such an authentic person ,COMMA and that's what authenticity is all about .PERIOD <BREAK>
respond ,COMMA and then we'll get the rest of your question .PERIOD <BREAK>
we could randomly divide them into two groups ,COMMA and then we could have one group that is a non-intervention control group to compare to ,COMMA which we can’t do with ,COMMA say ,COMMA breast cancer ,COMMA because everyone gets treated .PERIOD <BREAK>
each storm scours the atmosphere ,COMMA washing out dust ,COMMA soot ,COMMA trace chemicals ,COMMA and depositing them on the snow pack year after year ,COMMA millennia after millennia ,COMMA creating a kind of periodic table of elements that at this point is more than <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> feet thick .PERIOD <BREAK>

i stand for this soldier who suffered partial hearing loss and sustained permanent injuries to her leg ,COMMA which was hit by a rocket on a mission in afghanistan .PERIOD <BREAK>
ok ,COMMA so i ended up in louisville ,COMMA kentucky .PERIOD <BREAK>
but i wanted to reach out to you and say ,COMMA i understand that you disagree with me ,COMMA and i'm going to take my lumps on this one .PERIOD <BREAK>
how do we glue those grains of sand together ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
but even if you look across the mood music in europe of late ,COMMA far-right fascism is also on the rise .PERIOD <BREAK>
how do you actually track them down ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
but nothing ,COMMA nothing prepared me for what i was to hear on the first of july <NUM> .PERIOD <BREAK>

we started r&amp ;SEMICOLON d in <NUM> .PERIOD <BREAK>
it speaks so eloquently to the problem .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so what you realize is that darwin ,COMMA in a sense ,COMMA had the idea ,COMMA he had the concept ,COMMA but was unable of fully thinking it yet .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the proponents of this theory point to that small pocket of dravidian-speaking people in the north ,COMMA actually near afghanistan ,COMMA and they say that perhaps ,COMMA sometime in the past ,COMMA dravidian languages were spoken all over india and that this suggests that the indus civilization is perhaps also dravidian .PERIOD <BREAK>
i just want to briefly highlight ,COMMA the blue rods are the scores of microscopy only at the five clinics in dar es salaam on a population of <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> people ,COMMA where <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> reported to get a test done .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's not your phone -- it's your computer .PERIOD <BREAK>
it is not .PERIOD it is also shaped equally by history and culture .PERIOD <BREAK>
on the other hand ,COMMA try to say that this is not the case ,COMMA because there is a scientific consensus about this pattern now .PERIOD <BREAK>
they'll do well .PERIOD they'll have successful careers .PERIOD <BREAK>
i started working on my mother's signature ,COMMA because my father's is absolutely impossible to forge .PERIOD <BREAK>
they take their leisure very seriously :COLON they acquire skills ;SEMICOLON they invest time ;SEMICOLON they use technology that's getting cheaper -- it's not just the internet :COLON cameras ,COMMA design technology ,COMMA leisure technology ,COMMA surfboards ,COMMA so on and so forth .PERIOD <BREAK>

and that can happen with awareness -- awareness of the reality of oneness and the projection of self-hood .PERIOD <BREAK>
we promise something great ,COMMA we evangelize it ,COMMA we're going to change the world .PERIOD it doesn't work out too well ,COMMA and so we actually go back to the well and start all over again ,COMMA as the people in new york and l .PERIOD a .PERIOD look on in absolute ,COMMA morbid astonishment .PERIOD <BREAK>
solar manifesto by hermann scheer ,COMMA in germany ,COMMA claims all energy on earth can be derived ,COMMA for every country ,COMMA from solar energy and water ,COMMA and so on .PERIOD <BREAK>
the phones just aren't ringing about the people .PERIOD <BREAK>

if people in poorer countries can be hit by a crisis that starts in new york or starts in the sub-prime market of the united states of america .PERIOD <BREAK>
i went to ambassador dobrynin ,COMMA whom i knew very well .PERIOD <BREAK>
it takes good equipment and well-trained ,COMMA dedicated soldiers .PERIOD <BREAK>
and then he said ,COMMA well ,COMMA i must give them a car that they can afford ,COMMA one lakh car ,COMMA $ <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> car .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA i'm going to have a moment to think ,COMMA and i'll try to make something out of it .PERIOD <BREAK>
so that red line there was something that a lot of skeptics said the environmentalists only put in the projections to make the projections look as bad as possible ,COMMA that emissions would never grow as fast as that red line .PERIOD <BREAK>
and as i lifted my leg out of bed ,COMMA she reached for my crutches and handed them to me .PERIOD <BREAK>
and put another way ,COMMA the crux of the problem is the machine that we use for thinking about other minds ,COMMA our brain ,COMMA is made up of pieces ,COMMA brain cells ,COMMA that we share with all other animals ,COMMA with monkeys and mice and even sea slugs .PERIOD <BREAK>
so they get tired ,COMMA has come dark and rain ;SEMICOLON they get weary and tired .PERIOD <BREAK>
of these six ,COMMA the first one that we're going to talk about is in the black envelope you're holding .PERIOD <BREAK>
let me marshal the evidence here ,COMMA because i'm not telling you a story ,COMMA i'm making a case .PERIOD <BREAK>
now ,COMMA also a video is done of the patient or spouse and medical presenter ,COMMA with the patient agreeing that he understands the procedure to be done ,COMMA including all the possible failure modes .PERIOD <BREAK>
i mean art was my best subject in school .PERIOD <BREAK>
look at this .PERIOD this is the site of the government of india .PERIOD <BREAK>
why ?QUESTIONMARK because these things don't evolve by themselves .PERIOD <BREAK>
this probe actually can't use chemical rockets .PERIOD <BREAK>
a century-scale ,COMMA decadal-scale variability ,COMMA and we know the magnitude ;SEMICOLON it's about two-tenths to four-tenths of a degree centigrade .PERIOD <BREAK>
powerful new technologies always present enigmas .PERIOD <BREAK>
but it does .PERIOD generally ,COMMA we haven't got ourselves into this mess through big disasters .PERIOD <BREAK>
there's no damage outside .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA i've taken it apart ,COMMA component by component ,COMMA months and months and months of work .PERIOD <BREAK>
we're running out of land .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the three major phases of the early universe was energy ,COMMA when the dominant force was energy ;SEMICOLON then it became ,COMMA the dominant force ,COMMA as it cooled ,COMMA became matter ;SEMICOLON and then ,COMMA with the invention of life ,COMMA four billion years ago ,COMMA the dominant force in our neighborhood became information .PERIOD <BREAK>
you said ,COMMA now everything automatically goes from my iphone ,COMMA but actually you do take the pictures and put on information .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it's this combination ,COMMA this cumulative technology ,COMMA that intrigues me ,COMMA because i think it's the secret to understanding what's happening in the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
people are inspired by moral heroes .PERIOD <BREAK>
i'll give you an example from a case .PERIOD <BREAK>
you're looking for <NUM> million -- at what kind of valuation ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>

but what you'll see is -- it's going to receive a push now from the left .PERIOD <BREAK>
we have the plants that are giving to the animals a kind of sweet substance -- very energizing -- having in change this transportation of the pollen .PERIOD <BREAK>
as you can see here ,COMMA there's some direct light on the floor ,COMMA but they could easily figure out where that comes from .PERIOD <BREAK>
now this was -- you make a joint of six ,COMMA you make an icosahedron .PERIOD <BREAK>
the violin is basically made of a wood box and four main strings .PERIOD <BREAK>
they were both big fans ,COMMA mother and daughter -- very unusual .PERIOD <BREAK>
we're a free society ,COMMA so we let pornography and all these things -- we shrug them off .PERIOD <BREAK>
you notice we haven't got everybody who has a photo .PERIOD <BREAK>
so a conscious mind is a mind with a self in it .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so that's incredible .PERIOD and there's no money to do that .PERIOD <BREAK>
these kids did a little graffiti on their desks ,COMMA and then they signed up for two extra courses .PERIOD <BREAK>
and that's really exciting .PERIOD <BREAK>
so having people involved in planning for <NUM> is not necessarily going to change anything ,COMMA because the dictators are still the ones who control the agenda .PERIOD <BREAK>
what we have here is a list of old viruses .PERIOD <BREAK>
natural selection also explains many basic revulsions ,COMMA such as the horrid smell of rotting meat ,COMMA or fears ,COMMA such as the fear of snakes or standing close to the edge of a cliff .PERIOD <BREAK>
but he didn't die on dench's birthday .PERIOD <BREAK>
women are heroes created a new dynamic in each of the communities ,COMMA and the women kept that dynamic after we left .PERIOD <BREAK>
sorry ,COMMA it doesn't work .PERIOD you have to give it for <NUM> dollars ,COMMA <NUM> dollars .PERIOD <BREAK>

the redwood species seems to exist in another kind of time :COLON not human time ,COMMA but what we might call redwood time .PERIOD <BREAK>
what happened next was remarkable ,COMMA and it's where our cylinder enters the story .PERIOD <BREAK>
now ,COMMA i tell you this story about summer camp .PERIOD <BREAK>
but they wrote a paper about this ,COMMA and everybody in the western world began using electricity to convulse people who were either schizophrenic or severely depressed .PERIOD <BREAK>
and he had somewhat of a minor league womanizing reputation .PERIOD <BREAK>
why doesn’t it smell of potatoes or violets ?QUESTIONMARK well ,COMMA there are really two theories .PERIOD <BREAK>
they've wired them like patients in an icu .PERIOD <BREAK>
but it's around us everywhere ,COMMA presumably ,COMMA if it hasn't been wiped out by some other process in the universe .PERIOD <BREAK>
now the bacteria are dilute ,COMMA that little hormone molecule is gone ,COMMA so they're not making light -- but of course the squid doesn't care .PERIOD it's asleep in the sand .PERIOD <BREAK>
so to get work done ,COMMA you've got to set a deadline ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
weightfully upon me was the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
steven pinker :COLON very much .PERIOD it would fit both in wright's theory ,COMMA that it allows us to enjoy the benefits of cooperation over larger and larger circles .PERIOD but also ,COMMA i think it helps us imagine what it's like to be someone else .PERIOD i think when you read these horrific tortures that were common in the middle ages ,COMMA you think ,COMMA how could they possibly have done it ,COMMA how could they have not have empathized with the person that they're disemboweling ?QUESTIONMARK but clearly ,COMMA as far as they're concerned ,COMMA this is just an alien being that does not have feelings akin to their own .PERIOD anything ,COMMA i think ,COMMA that makes it easier to imagine trading places with someone else means that it increases your moral consideration to that other person .PERIOD <BREAK>
my first spoken word poem ,COMMA packed with all the wisdom of a <NUM> -year-old ,COMMA was about the injustice of being seen as unfeminine .PERIOD <BREAK>
you know ,COMMA there are cases where you spend quite a lot of money and you accomplish quite a lot .PERIOD <BREAK>
we hoisted them on poles to photograph .PERIOD <BREAK>
i know what they're thinking :COLON you don't know .PERIOD <BREAK>
not everybody could earn an a or a b ,COMMA and i didn't like that way of judging it .PERIOD <BREAK>
and this is heightened by a couple of particular experiences .PERIOD <BREAK>
and that's a concerted platform .PERIOD <BREAK>
but ,COMMA one of the problems with planting trees is that the people in these regions are so poor that they chop them down for firewood .PERIOD <BREAK>
and surely ,COMMA somewhere in the universe two black holes have merged .PERIOD <BREAK>
suddenly humans show up -- homo erectus -- big ,COMMA old melon-head .PERIOD <BREAK>
i assure you ,COMMA it is very true .PERIOD <BREAK>
now this also ,COMMA as good as it is ,COMMA wasn't quite enough .PERIOD <BREAK>
<NUM> .PERIOD now ,COMMA the way we can square on most calculators -- let me demonstrate with this one -- is by taking the number ,COMMA such as five ,COMMA hitting times and then equals ,COMMA and on most calculators that will give you the square .PERIOD <BREAK>
we were directing tastes towards more resilience ,COMMA more restorative options .PERIOD <BREAK>
so my idea was born ,COMMA and i had the project set up and a hypothesis ,COMMA so what was my next step ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
they can unite .PERIOD they can come together .PERIOD if people would stop ,COMMA lives will be saved .PERIOD <BREAK>
that is still the waterfront of effective policies :COLON aid ,COMMA trade ,COMMA security ,COMMA governments .PERIOD <BREAK>
the u .PERIOD n .PERIOD -- you know ,COMMA they took <NUM> years just to add a flap to a tent ,COMMA but i think we have some more exciting things .PERIOD <BREAK>
this can be in spirituality .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it's not just atrazine they're exposed to .PERIOD <BREAK>
time is one of the scarcest resources in the modern world .PERIOD <BREAK>
or you could play many games in one small patch of land ,COMMA even if you didn't know which game you were actually in .PERIOD <BREAK>
turn it into a square that stands for all the arable land on earth .PERIOD <BREAK>
spectator play ,COMMA ritual play -- we're involved in some of that .PERIOD <BREAK>
and they said ,COMMA well ,COMMA they became our native americans here in the u .PERIOD s .PERIOD <BREAK>
and we kind of object at first ,COMMA saying ,COMMA oh ,COMMA that's awful .PERIOD <BREAK>
it’s basically the same thing as the <NUM> circles thing that i just had you do .PERIOD <BREAK>
there's a lot you can't see ,COMMA also ,COMMA underwater .PERIOD <BREAK>
what's interesting is that this particular way of looking at the world ,COMMA is ,COMMA i think ,COMMA only one of four different ways that manifest themselves in different fields of endeavor .PERIOD <BREAK>
so we took his hand and we painted it to look a little bit more like eddie's .PERIOD <BREAK>
and then i told as many ,COMMA many people as i possibly could about it so that there was no way that i could chicken out later on .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is what's been powering the u .PERIOD s .PERIOD economy .PERIOD it's moore's law .PERIOD <BREAK>
i want to give you one example .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's really interesting :COLON what many people think when i say the word design is they think of this kind of overdesigned -- in this case ,COMMA it's overdesigned on purpose ,COMMA but -- decoration ,COMMA interior decoration .PERIOD <BREAK>
and you know what ?QUESTIONMARK if we can't do that ,COMMA if we can't use our intellectual power to end slavery ,COMMA there is one last question :COLON are we truly free ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
but the thing about self-expression is that there's traditionally been this imbalance between the desire that we have to express ourselves and the number of sympathetic friends who are willing to stand around and listen .PERIOD <BREAK>
and we had this problem ,COMMA too ,COMMA for a while ,COMMA and we said ,COMMA oh ,COMMA we really need a new concept .PERIOD <BREAK>
they are fascinated with snakes .PERIOD they haven't got that steely thing that you end up either fearing or hating or despising or loathing them in some way .PERIOD <BREAK>
the eiffel tower has a fractal aspect .PERIOD <BREAK>

well there is actually six of them .PERIOD there are two ways to be present-oriented .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's never been answered before .PERIOD <BREAK>
i wanna start today -- here's my thing .PERIOD hold on .PERIOD there i go .PERIOD <BREAK>
and then ,COMMA again ,COMMA the final shot .PERIOD <BREAK>
and to my astonishment ,COMMA when i began seriously studying other traditions ,COMMA i began to realize that belief -- which we make such a fuss about today -- is only a very recent religious enthusiasm that surfaced only in the west ,COMMA in about the <NUM> th century .PERIOD <BREAK>
when edison invented the light bulb ,COMMA pretty much looked like this .PERIOD <BREAK>
it means i have enough .PERIOD and that is utterly true .PERIOD <BREAK>
do you think you could do it ?QUESTIONMARK i would like to see if this audience would -- no ,COMMA you haven't practiced ,COMMA as far as i know -- can you get it together to clap in sync ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
people who had to move to think .PERIOD who had to move to think .PERIOD <BREAK>
let's get back to that .PERIOD and the idea ,COMMA too ,COMMA of jews ,COMMA christians and muslims -- these traditions now so often at loggerheads -- working together to create a document which we hope will be signed by a thousand ,COMMA at least ,COMMA of major religious leaders from all the traditions of the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
but based on what data ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
we finally gave up ,COMMA took it out of the code .PERIOD <BREAK>
here's another operation .PERIOD it's all cottage industries ,COMMA so it's not big places -- it's all in people's front porches ,COMMA in their backyards ,COMMA even in their homes they're burning boards ,COMMA if there's a concern for somebody coming by -- because it is considered in china to be illegal ,COMMA doing it ,COMMA but they can't stop the product from coming in .PERIOD <BREAK>
and in fact ,COMMA among all the diseases that existed in this land ,COMMA it was the worst .PERIOD it killed the most children .PERIOD <BREAK>
you cannot ,COMMA in the same gesture ,COMMA shake hand and give a blow .PERIOD <BREAK>
so those laws are going to kind of spread throughout all media .PERIOD <BREAK>
and within half a day donation sites were up ,COMMA and donations were pouring in from all around the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
smile ,COMMA friendly .PERIOD <BREAK>
oliver sacks :COLON i was afraid you'd ask that .PERIOD <BREAK>
we've also made partnerships with artists ,COMMA with people who understand and can communicate the aesthetic beauty of trees and forest canopies .PERIOD <BREAK>
and this works for metastatic lymph nodes also .PERIOD <BREAK>
there are some good points to be made here ,COMMA things that we ought to be thinking about ,COMMA forward planning so that nothing goes too -- well ,COMMA so that we minimize the turbulence when we actually figure out how to fix aging .PERIOD <BREAK>
thank you .PERIOD <BREAK>
and if you look in a comparison ,COMMA on the left ,COMMA we see what volumetric data gives us and on the right you see what markers give us .PERIOD <BREAK>
it weighs <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> kilograms and the only exercise i get is opening and closing it .PERIOD <BREAK>
that's a reason to go out of home .PERIOD yeah ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and that makes failure seem much more crushing .PERIOD <BREAK>
i didn't know what was meat ,COMMA what was vegetarian .PERIOD <BREAK>
oxygen concentrators are very old technology .PERIOD what is new ,COMMA and what we will have in a few months ,COMMA i hope ,COMMA is that ability to use this same renewable energy system to provide and produce oxygen on site .PERIOD zeolite -- it's not new -- zeolite removes nitrogen from air and nitrogen is <NUM> percent of air .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i hope it will be for everybody .PERIOD <BREAK>
everybody here is coming at it from a different way .PERIOD <BREAK>
a whole youtube channel of people submitting really interesting content .PERIOD <BREAK>
that's the first time in india ,COMMA and i can tell you ,COMMA that's the last time you're hearing about it .PERIOD <BREAK>
so it's just a question of waiting for the next one and then marveling at how we could have been so stupid as not to protect ourselves against that .PERIOD <BREAK>
one is that nothing in the body happens in isolation .PERIOD <BREAK>
every scientist will recognize that expression of despair .PERIOD <BREAK>
so the way this works is ,COMMA you have a simple system of five chemicals here ,COMMA a simple system here .PERIOD when they hybridize ,COMMA you then form something that's different than before ,COMMA it's more complex than before ,COMMA and you get the emergence of another kind of lifelike behavior which in this case is replication .PERIOD <BREAK>
and they can use that task-specific odor in cuticular hydrocarbons -- they can use that in their brief antennal contacts to somehow keep track of the rate at which they're meeting ants of certain tasks .PERIOD <BREAK>
we don't have the enterprise ,COMMA but we've got an ion drive now .PERIOD <BREAK>
but moving on .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is why you started actually a new paradigm shift ,COMMA where the same people who could not dream of sitting in a car ,COMMA who were carrying their entire family in a scooter ,COMMA started dreaming of being in a car .PERIOD <BREAK>
and to use our advanced technologies to pull out what is beneficial from this sea of noise ,COMMA basically .PERIOD <BREAK>
mustard exists ,COMMA just like tomato sauce ,COMMA on a horizontal plane .PERIOD <BREAK>
i don't even know if you can see that in the back row .PERIOD these are just stars .PERIOD <BREAK>
and while i'm okay now ,COMMA i wouldn't wish this gift for you .PERIOD <BREAK>
now a fundamental and really viscerally important experience for me ,COMMA in terms of music ,COMMA has been my adventures in south africa ,COMMA the most dizzyingly musical country on the planet in my view ,COMMA but a country which ,COMMA through its musical culture ,COMMA has taught me one fundamental lesson :COLON that through music making can come deep levels of fundamental life-giving trust .PERIOD <BREAK>
then recently rock band has been a big hit .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is kind of like something i used to do in third grade .PERIOD <BREAK>
they're not just possible ;SEMICOLON they're critical .PERIOD <BREAK>
and here is the last bit .PERIOD <BREAK>
as the trevor project says ,COMMA it gets better .PERIOD <BREAK>
so the children said ,COMMA how do we do that .PERIOD <BREAK>
we also see the phenomenon -- some of you may have boomerang kids -- these are boomerang alumni ,COMMA where universities are actually reconnecting with alumni in helping them with jobs ,COMMA sharing skills and retraining .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's a true actual goal .PERIOD it's a very ambitious goal ,COMMA but we truly believe that we can do it .PERIOD <BREAK>
but that's the price of having a civilization .PERIOD <BREAK>
i must say ,COMMA so fervent was my love of the old brooklyn dodgers in those days that i had to confess in my first confession two sins that related to baseball .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i was taking care of people who were dying and their families in the south side of chicago .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i had an armored organization at that point .PERIOD <BREAK>
because i think only through uncertainty is there potential for understanding .PERIOD <BREAK>
and they got really excited about it .PERIOD they liked the film ,COMMA but they said ,COMMA you know ,COMMA we really see this as kind of the next wave in the study of human origins ,COMMA where we all came from ,COMMA using the tools of dna to map the migrations around the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
a handy thing to have ,COMMA because language is infinite ,COMMA and you can't just parrot back the sentences that you've heard .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it was worth it ,COMMA because they bought this thing ,COMMA and it played out on such a grand scale ,COMMA and it's so internationally recognizable ,COMMA but for me it was actually a very ,COMMA very depressing year .PERIOD <BREAK>
if you've heard about the mayan <NUM> apocalypse ,COMMA you're going to hear about apophis ,COMMA because you're keyed in to all the doomsday networks anyway .PERIOD <BREAK>
he had misheard me and thought i was coming up because i was trying to make a poster ,COMMA and so wasn't prepared to take me into the mines .PERIOD <BREAK>
we're at best ignored and maligned and abused ,COMMA at worst ,COMMA by negligent regulatory agencies ,COMMA pernicious zoning and lax governmental accountability .PERIOD <BREAK>
i expect some of you remember the iloveyou virus ,COMMA one of the very great worldwide viruses that came .PERIOD <BREAK>
and one of the ways i like to do that is to look back at the stories people used to tell before we had cheap oil ,COMMA before we had fossil fuels ,COMMA and people relied on their own muscle ,COMMA animal muscle energy ,COMMA or a little bit of wind ,COMMA little bit of water energy .PERIOD <BREAK>
which makes for a very -- can make for a very stressful situation .PERIOD <BREAK>
ireland is one of the fastest-growing economies in the european union today .PERIOD <BREAK>
on the contrary ,COMMA doodling should be leveraged in precisely those situations where information density is very high and the need for processing that information is very high .PERIOD <BREAK>
the only thing that queen victoria would not be amused by in modern dictionaries is our inclusion of the f-word ,COMMA which has happened in american dictionaries since <NUM> .PERIOD <BREAK>

you place it in a music hall ,COMMA it all of a sudden becomes a musical score .PERIOD <BREAK>
not just show up to class every now and then .PERIOD <BREAK>
now the united states has a particularly important role to play in this :COLON to keep our education system globalized ,COMMA to keep our education system open to students from all over the world ,COMMA because our education system is the candle that other students come to light their own candles .PERIOD <BREAK>
it needs to be flat ,COMMA so it's transportable .PERIOD <BREAK>
i tried to imagine myself in their place ,COMMA and i was totally humbled by their courage and determination in the face of such catastrophic loss .PERIOD <BREAK>
when i breathed out ,COMMA my co <NUM> fed the sweet potatoes that i was growing .PERIOD <BREAK>
it would be terrible .PERIOD <BREAK>
i know you're there because i can hear you ,COMMA but i can't see you because i normally wear glasses .PERIOD <BREAK>
we actually take donor organs ,COMMA organs that are discarded ,COMMA and we then can use very mild detergents to take all the cell elements out of these organs .PERIOD <BREAK>
we're still living with the old paradigm of age as an arch .PERIOD <BREAK>

the master said ,COMMA 'thou didst thy best ,COMMA that is success .PERIOD ' from those things ,COMMA and one other perhaps ,COMMA i coined my own definition of success ,COMMA which is :COLON peace of mind attained only through self-satisfaction in knowing you made the effort to do the best of which you're capable .PERIOD <BREAK>
sexually attractive people are hot .PERIOD <BREAK>
in fact ,COMMA we no longer see ,COMMA within this process ,COMMA the traditional master architect creating a sketch that his minions carry out .PERIOD <BREAK>
today we have <NUM> million refugees in the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
design was just a part of the process .PERIOD <BREAK>
you change that system ,COMMA and you could have a marked effect on the cancer .PERIOD <BREAK>
so i started to educate myself on this molecular level .PERIOD <BREAK>
carbon dioxide ,COMMA a little bit of sunlight ,COMMA you end up with a lipid that is highly refined .PERIOD <BREAK>
so that is an example ,COMMA both of wisdom in practice and the subversion of wisdom by rules that are meant ,COMMA of course ,COMMA to make things better .PERIOD <BREAK>
and some of you all might know ,COMMA about five years ago i was an analyst at a hedge fund ,COMMA and i was in boston ,COMMA and i was tutoring my cousins in new orleans ,COMMA remotely .PERIOD <BREAK>
planet saturn .PERIOD yes ,COMMA that's good .PERIOD <BREAK>

so please ,COMMA the next time you go to a concert ,COMMA just allow your body to open up ,COMMA allow your body to be this resonating chamber .PERIOD <BREAK>
certainly .PERIOD well ,COMMA the first is ,COMMA instead of sending a billion dollars on drug eradication and paying it to a couple of security companies ,COMMA they should give this hundred billion dollars to <NUM> of the most critically innovative companies in the world to ask them to create one million jobs .PERIOD <BREAK>
needless to say ,COMMA different populations from different parts of the world have different sorts of contact .PERIOD <BREAK>
that's very obvious ,COMMA we all know that .PERIOD <BREAK>
all they have ,COMMA really ,COMMA is trademark protection ,COMMA and so it means that anybody could copy any garment on any person in this room and sell it as their own design .PERIOD <BREAK>
he put up a slide a little bit like this .PERIOD <BREAK>
that's when i realized ,COMMA you know ,COMMA cartoons are really powerful ,COMMA art comes with responsibility .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA let me explain to you what i mean when i think about compassion ,COMMA and why i think it is so important that right at this point in history .PERIOD <BREAK>
every problem in a city has to have its own equation of co-responsibility and also a design .PERIOD <BREAK>
i managed to convince him that it was important for us ,COMMA but possibly also for other people that he shared his story .PERIOD <BREAK>
based on these findings ,COMMA i have a question for you .PERIOD <BREAK>
and we feel like some of that difficulty was because of this false advertisement around parenting .PERIOD <BREAK>
but that's easily said .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's a holocaust of a different kind ,COMMA and hiding under our desks isn't going to help .PERIOD <BREAK>
lexicography is really more about material science .PERIOD <BREAK>
why ?QUESTIONMARK because your brain is seeing that same information as if the right one is still under red light ,COMMA and the left one is still under green light .PERIOD <BREAK>

there was no particular day when anyone told me i would never speak again ;SEMICOLON it just sort of became obvious .PERIOD <BREAK>
as we get more technically driven ,COMMA the importance of people becomes more than it's ever been before .PERIOD <BREAK>

ten small bowls of pasta ,COMMA with a different spaghetti sauce on each one .PERIOD <BREAK>

one of the things we see about life is that it moves from the inner to increasing sociability .PERIOD and by that it means that there is more and more of life whose entire environment is other life .PERIOD <BREAK>

the center of the atlantic where the mixing is ,COMMA i could imagine a policy that lets canada and america fish ,COMMA because they manage their fisheries well ,COMMA they're doing a good job .PERIOD <BREAK>
one of them is just obtaining trust from individuals that we work with in the field .PERIOD <BREAK>

and because god loves her ,COMMA i did get married .PERIOD <BREAK>
meteorites delivered chemistry ,COMMA and perhaps membranes ,COMMA too .PERIOD <BREAK>
let's play a little .PERIOD <BREAK>
i'm going to try to put that in some sort of order .PERIOD <BREAK>
culture's a very important tool to bring people together .PERIOD <BREAK>
all of these are in the lab pushing further and further and further ,COMMA not as metaphor but literally integrating bits and atoms ,COMMA and they lead to the following recognition .PERIOD <BREAK>
that pulls in more material and pulls in more material .PERIOD <BREAK>
the truth of the matter is that the titanic -- even though it's breaking all sorts of box office records -- it's not the most exciting story from the sea .PERIOD <BREAK>

and so ,COMMA i lived in kigali for about two and a half years ,COMMA doing these two things ,COMMA and it was an extraordinary time in my life .PERIOD <BREAK>
because when you open up like that ,COMMA then you can't just -- what good does it do to add being miserable with others' misery ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
but it is a place where the putting-in of the troops has increased the violence rather than decreased it .PERIOD <BREAK>

back in <NUM> when comedian richard pryor accidentally set himself on fire during a freebasing accident ,COMMA i was in los angeles the day after it happened and then i was in washington d .PERIOD c .PERIOD two days after that .PERIOD <BREAK>

it can be for <NUM> or <NUM> minutes .PERIOD we call that resting or benching .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is where i realized that there was really a need to communicate ,COMMA because the data of what's happening in the world and the child health of every country is very well aware .PERIOD <BREAK>
so that their decisions are based on past memories .PERIOD <BREAK>
now this ,COMMA for me ,COMMA is a common situation .PERIOD <BREAK>
near the summit ,COMMA temperatures can be <NUM> degrees below zero .PERIOD <BREAK>
so we'll have to use our computers to try to unscramble the chain .PERIOD <BREAK>
but what people in this room know ,COMMA and what we have to remind ourselves ,COMMA though -- because you can know something intellectually ,COMMA you can know what to do and then not use it ,COMMA not apply it .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the two manipulators are inside .PERIOD <BREAK>
i wish to go with you .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is the kind of innovation that is ,COMMA quite frankly -- it's interesting that it's coming from africa .PERIOD <BREAK>

at a business level ,COMMA you might look at the well-being of your employees ,COMMA which we know is really linked to creativity ,COMMA which is linked to innovation ,COMMA and we're going to need a lot of innovation to deal with those environmental issues .PERIOD <BREAK>
but now ,COMMA as they say in infomercials ,COMMA we have something much better for you ,COMMA which we're working on :COLON planes that are only six inches -- <NUM> centimeters -- in size .PERIOD <BREAK>
and then the child turned two ,COMMA and i started using the cheap and easy treatment ,COMMA and i wonder -- and she wondered ,COMMA like all parents who lose children wonder -- if there isn't something that i could have done ,COMMA like keep on using that complicated ,COMMA expensive cure .PERIOD <BREAK>

the second problem that comes with headphone abuse is compression .PERIOD <BREAK>
i also had the good fortune to be in those lectures ,COMMA up in the balcony .PERIOD <BREAK>

how do you make a large sheet of glass smaller ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and this breathing apparatus now saved the life ,COMMA and she's very welcome .PERIOD <BREAK>
for <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> pieces .PERIOD <BREAK>
remember that i mentioned before the children who lose their fingertips .PERIOD <BREAK>
well ,COMMA it's damn hard doing the calculations ,COMMA that's the problem .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i meet a lot of people who are very successful ,COMMA who say ,COMMA why don't i feel more fulfilled ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and this is what we started to do in one of the largest countries on the continent ,COMMA nigeria .PERIOD <BREAK>
but it's a totally different sort of process that determines which ideas spread ,COMMA and which ones don't .PERIOD <BREAK>
but the total energy consumption will increase to <NUM> units .PERIOD <BREAK>
here's another interesting truth about the doodle :COLON people who doodle when they're exposed to verbal information retain more of that information than their non-doodling counterparts .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the mantra was :COLON shoot first ;SEMICOLON ask questions later .PERIOD <BREAK>
the fact that they have stuck here with this kind of performance has been ,COMMA well ,COMMA you know ,COMMA you win the war in <NUM> minutes ;SEMICOLON why do you need something better ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and that calculation isn't much in dispute .PERIOD <BREAK>
the world was never told there was a day of global ceasefire and nonviolence .PERIOD <BREAK>

walter mischel ,COMMA my colleague at stanford ,COMMA went back <NUM> years later ,COMMA to try to discover what was different about those kids .PERIOD <BREAK>

but that's a slightly different story ,COMMA which i won't go into now .PERIOD <BREAK>
he built this machine ,COMMA and we had a beautiful demonstration of how this thing really works ,COMMA with these little bits .PERIOD and it's an idea that goes way back .PERIOD <BREAK>
and then i put some ultraviolet filters on my camera and took a very ,COMMA very long exposure with the particular frequencies of ultraviolet light and this is what i got .PERIOD <BREAK>
he was really nervous ,COMMA because his dad had been ,COMMA you know ,COMMA beheaded for being the king of england and he was nervous about the fact that conversations that got going in ,COMMA like ,COMMA bars and stuff would turn to -- this is kind of -- it's hard to believe ,COMMA but people in the <NUM> th century in england were starting to talk about ,COMMA you know ,COMMA philosophy and stuff in bars .PERIOD <BREAK>
so i should say ,COMMA i guess ,COMMA that since the time of that original president johnson report ,COMMA and the various reports of the u .PERIOD s .PERIOD national academy -- <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> -- people always talked about this idea .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the idea is you fast forward and good students start failing algebra all of a sudden and start failing calculus all of a sudden ,COMMA despite being smart ,COMMA despite having good teachers ,COMMA and it's usually because they have these swiss cheese gaps that kept building throughout their foundation .PERIOD <BREAK>
there are these terrifyingly huge indian trucks that come careening around one-lane roads with two-lane traffic ,COMMA with <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> -foot drop-offs right next to the road ,COMMA and he was driving one of these trucks .PERIOD <BREAK>

now ,COMMA what's missing from the larger debate is a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis between not fixing an unhealthy ,COMMA environmentally challenged community ,COMMA versus incorporating structural ,COMMA sustainable changes .PERIOD <BREAK>
but then ,COMMA of course ,COMMA the body has many parts ,COMMA and things grow at different rates ,COMMA and they have different sizes and different people ;SEMICOLON however ,COMMA not so with the interior .PERIOD <BREAK>
the language of technology is binary ;SEMICOLON you've probably heard that at some point in time .PERIOD <BREAK>
it was just saying random english phonemes .PERIOD <BREAK>
the only criticism ,COMMA and people really don't want to criticize this ,COMMA because it is a humanitarian effort ;SEMICOLON it is a nonprofit effort ;SEMICOLON and to criticize it is a little bit stupid ,COMMA actually .PERIOD <BREAK>
you're putting yourself ,COMMA you're binding yourself ,COMMA and you're weaseling your way out of it ,COMMA and then you're beating yourself up afterwards .PERIOD <BREAK>
we would see where we were going ,COMMA we would see the first indication of what could be the successive phenomenon to the suv in america .PERIOD <BREAK>
they serve food to poor people .PERIOD <BREAK>
so you think that people thinking about the brain ,COMMA and consciousness generally ,COMMA could get real insight by saying ,COMMA where does movement play in this game ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
so ,COMMA if you look at nodes a and b ,COMMA they both have six connections .PERIOD <BREAK>
but it's still a big issue in brazil .PERIOD <BREAK>
day three .PERIOD <BREAK>
i want to share it ,COMMA to do formation flights .PERIOD <BREAK>
when the conquistadors arrived in north america you had two choices :COLON you either fight back and engage or you could take off .PERIOD <BREAK>
and then if it's time for analysis ,COMMA we can pull back a little bit and ask for a different distribution .PERIOD <BREAK>
it took my friends <NUM> years .PERIOD <BREAK>
the distribution amongst countries is extremely broad .PERIOD <BREAK>
finally ,COMMA let's see what this looks like .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the only purpose that these legs can serve ,COMMA outside the context of the film ,COMMA is to provoke the senses and ignite the imagination .PERIOD <BREAK>
they're not radically different from routers inside the middle of the network .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's a complicated physics problem .PERIOD <BREAK>
that's what i really like about it ,COMMA the fact that i haven't got to go and buy it ,COMMA and it hasn't been genetically modified at all .PERIOD <BREAK>
so darwin ,COMMA he took long walks alone in the woods and emphatically turned down dinner party invitations .PERIOD <BREAK>
and we drive away here -- we find the first garden in the street ,COMMA and they earn <NUM> to <NUM> dollars a day .PERIOD <BREAK>
first of all ,COMMA a little bit of audience participation .PERIOD <BREAK>
and by the way ,COMMA all those precautions to keep the norden bombsight out of the hands of the nazis ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
i go back to color all the time .PERIOD <BREAK>
working for peace is very creative .PERIOD <BREAK>
but what they did ,COMMA of course ,COMMA since it was so complicated and expensive ,COMMA they only used it on the zero-year-olds and the one-year-olds .PERIOD <BREAK>
now you pursue this guy ,COMMA gesticulating .PERIOD <BREAK>
in transkei ,COMMA i witnessed a rite of passage into manhood ,COMMA of the xhosa tribe .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i want to talk about the relationship between economic activity ,COMMA in particular export volume ,COMMA and hiv infections .PERIOD <BREAK>
i thank you very much .PERIOD <BREAK>
here are some of the stories they wanted us to share with you .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is the camera ,COMMA and three instruments .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i just wanted to share with you :COLON there's one reporter that came .PERIOD <BREAK>
i'd be extremely surprised if you didn't recognize many or most of them .PERIOD <BREAK>
then i ran <NUM> miles -- ultramarathons .PERIOD <BREAK>
instead ,COMMA we find it very easy to think in very relative terms as options change from one time to another .PERIOD <BREAK>
he said ,COMMA oh ,COMMA i can't move my phantom .PERIOD you know that .PERIOD it's painful .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i'd say ,COMMA i'm five .PERIOD i don't even know where i am .PERIOD <BREAK>
better immersion than to live untouched .PERIOD <BREAK>
<NUM> years to the day after the death of alfred nobel himself .PERIOD <BREAK>
we don't do that .PERIOD your brain doesn't do that .PERIOD <BREAK>
why do you think ,COMMA those of you who voted this way ,COMMA that the best flutes should go to the best flute players ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and i want to show you a short video clip that illustrates the first two components of this work .PERIOD <BREAK>
what they had in common was a sense of courage .PERIOD <BREAK>
all of humanity ,COMMA probably ,COMMA is descended from a thousand people who left africa roughly <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> years ago .PERIOD <BREAK>
sys admin force has to .PERIOD <BREAK>
i have to think of my role .PERIOD where i am in the universe ,COMMA and did somebody intend for me to be that way ,COMMA or is it just something i came up with ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>

went to alberto santos-dumont .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i'm not the first person to ask this question .PERIOD <BREAK>
i'll only just use a couple and then move on to sex and love .PERIOD <BREAK>
in my past projects i've often worked in serial form ,COMMA documenting things that have the appearance of being comprehensive through a determined title and a determined presentation ,COMMA but in fact ,COMMA are fairly abstract .PERIOD <BREAK>
so i got all these sort of magic tricks .PERIOD oh ,COMMA here .PERIOD i'll show you .PERIOD <BREAK>
there's a billion people without clean drinking water .PERIOD <BREAK>
i met psychiatrists who spent time with them ,COMMA aid workers ,COMMA ngos ,COMMA the whole lot .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so that's the sort of sequence ,COMMA and so i have a more artistic impression of this .PERIOD <BREAK>
but ,COMMA it turns out some component of stroke paralysis is also learned paralysis ,COMMA and maybe that component can be overcome using mirrors .PERIOD <BREAK>
that's where i realized the power of paper and glue .PERIOD <BREAK>
all you can do ,COMMA like a farmer ,COMMA is create the conditions under which they will begin to flourish .PERIOD <BREAK>
but we haven't witnessed a big asteroid impact ,COMMA so this is a type of neo-catastrophism ,COMMA and it took about <NUM> years for the scientific establishment to finally come to grips :COLON yes ,COMMA we were hit ;SEMICOLON and yes ,COMMA the effects of that hit caused a major mass extinction .PERIOD <BREAK>
man :COLON i clean my ceiling fans with that and i get the spider webs off my house -- i do it that way .PERIOD <BREAK>
we train corporate travel agents for the travel industry .PERIOD <BREAK>
and ,COMMA jennifer ,COMMA how did that feel ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and once the conditions are present ,COMMA what you are doing becomes worth doing for its own sake .PERIOD <BREAK>
i think cities facilitate more of the kind of networking ,COMMA the kind of casual interaction than you might have on a daily basis .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA a big question that we're facing now and have been for quite a number of years now :COLON are we at risk of a nuclear attack ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
you cannot talk to everybody all the time .PERIOD <BREAK>
i don't believe it and i think this idea ,COMMA popular as it is -- not in this guise but in general -- is itself one of the main problems that we face .PERIOD <BREAK>
and there's really no evidence that says -- well ,COMMA other than people just have disbelief that cells can do what they do .PERIOD <BREAK>
so the question is ,COMMA why is that ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
that's a cool name .PERIOD i will say that .PERIOD <BREAK>
basically ,COMMA emergence was published on <NUM> / <NUM> .PERIOD <BREAK>
if they change their appearance ,COMMA <NUM> of <NUM> -- that's <NUM> percent -- kill ,COMMA torture ,COMMA mutilate .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so ,COMMA like many people ,COMMA we start with a house on a lot ,COMMA and i'm going to show you a typical construction on the top and what we're doing on the bottom .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA this is bitu qalandar ,COMMA who was our first experiment .PERIOD <BREAK>
then you can drill down and understand how actually we put your level in context ,COMMA and we use color to illustrate exactly where your value falls .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it was rigged ,COMMA and it became unraveled when this man ,COMMA charles van doren ,COMMA was outed after an unnatural winning streak ,COMMA ending berry's career .PERIOD <BREAK>
why ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
this part's not going to be on the test .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the thing that the ordinary afghan is most concerned with is -- clare lockhart is here ,COMMA so i'll recite a discussion she had with an illiterate woman in northern afghanistan .PERIOD <BREAK>
the mclaren just popped off and scratched the side panel .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so they took them to some safe place .PERIOD <BREAK>
except it's supposed to be brown .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA in some sense ,COMMA what this is suggesting is that it's not just that people are setting up their car seats wrong ,COMMA which is putting children at risk .PERIOD it's just that ,COMMA fundamentally ,COMMA the car seats aren't doing much .PERIOD <BREAK>
and we don't have all the updated data any longer ,COMMA because this is really hot data today .PERIOD <BREAK>
richard wurman :COLON can i say something ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and when several of the homeless men realized that ,COMMA including a former university professor ,COMMA they said ,COMMA you aren't homeless .PERIOD why are you really here ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>

he was a very good golfer ,COMMA but he had a disability .PERIOD <BREAK>
i see .PERIOD maybe come back here .PERIOD <BREAK>
inflated results started coming in and the mob was starting to get out of control .PERIOD <BREAK>
now andy lipkis is working to help l .PERIOD a .PERIOD cut infrastructure costs associated with water management and urban heat island -- linking trees ,COMMA people and technology to create a more livable city .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it's interesting ,COMMA if you think about it ,COMMA how ,COMMA when we think about the civilizations that we look up to as having been pinnacles of human achievement -- whether it's china ,COMMA greece ,COMMA the hindu civilization ,COMMA or the mayas ,COMMA or egyptians -- what we know about them is really about their ecstasies ,COMMA not about their everyday life .PERIOD <BREAK>
men don't belong here ,COMMA that's pretty obvious .PERIOD <BREAK>
we'll need to attract the investors who will build out the infrastructure -- the power system ,COMMA the roads ,COMMA the port ,COMMA the airport ,COMMA the buildings .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's basically like a tree collecting water coming down .PERIOD <BREAK>
google enriches itself by enriching thousands of bloggers through adsense .PERIOD <BREAK>
i'm incredibly excited about that .PERIOD <BREAK>
and you follow the treatment like that ,COMMA to the end of the treatment .PERIOD <BREAK>
another water body ,COMMA dried up ,COMMA of course ,COMMA during the summer period ,COMMA but you can see how the traditional society combines engineering with aesthetics ,COMMA with the heart .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is called the dress .PERIOD <BREAK>
we're human beings .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's urgent work .PERIOD we know that temperatures are rising .PERIOD <BREAK>
the only thing they have in common is that they're different .PERIOD <BREAK>
and then backtrack innovations within that .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i was quite excited about this .PERIOD i was going to talk a little bit about research ,COMMA a little bit about the kitchen .PERIOD <BREAK>
but what we're finding around the world ,COMMA over and over again ,COMMA is ,COMMA if you build a toilet and you leave it there ,COMMA it doesn't get used .PERIOD <BREAK>
when you live that way ,COMMA when you live with that kind of passion ,COMMA there's no time ,COMMA there's no time for regrets ,COMMA you're just moving forward .PERIOD <BREAK>
but small atoms want to join together ,COMMA small nuclei want to join together to make bigger ones to go towards iron .PERIOD <BREAK>
who's got the work ethic now ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
but they can do pretty amazing things ,COMMA too .PERIOD <BREAK>

on my wish list ,COMMA at least ,COMMA would be :COLON much longer ,COMMA healthier lives ,COMMA greater subjective well-being ,COMMA enhanced cognitive capacities ,COMMA more knowledge and understanding ,COMMA unlimited opportunity for personal growth beyond our current biological limits ,COMMA better relationships ,COMMA an unbounded potential for spiritual ,COMMA moral and intellectual development .PERIOD <BREAK>
but it's hard sometimes to talk about these things ,COMMA so bear with me .PERIOD <BREAK>
so the question was ,COMMA i started looking at this issue ,COMMA and going back and forth between bangladesh and new york .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it was [unclear] tata trust ,COMMA which gave me six rupees per month ,COMMA almost a dollar per month for six years .PERIOD <BREAK>
i look at the logo ,COMMA and it sort of ties it to my brain .PERIOD <BREAK>
something's got to be done about this .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so it’s not something -- happiness is not something you get ,COMMA health is generally not something that you get .PERIOD <BREAK>
imagine if you're speaking with somebody who's growing things and making them flourish ,COMMA somebody who's using their talents to do something productive ,COMMA somebody who's built their own business from scratch ,COMMA someone who is surrounded by abundance ,COMMA not scarcity ,COMMA who's in fact creating abundance ,COMMA somebody with full hands with something to offer ,COMMA not empty hands asking for you to give them something .PERIOD <BREAK>
it was written for an amazing singer called cathy berberian .PERIOD <BREAK>
he repeated that about <NUM> times in the two days i was with him .PERIOD <BREAK>
you want to spend the day fishing with him .PERIOD <BREAK>
i mean ,COMMA i feel useless .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i think that if the marketing were more aspirational ,COMMA if we could focus as a community on how far we've come and how amazing it would be to eradicate this disease ,COMMA we could put polio fatigue and polio behind us .PERIOD <BREAK>
there was a cabinet meeting and a meeting of the presidents to talk about whether vaginas could come to uganda .PERIOD <BREAK>
this isn't one of those rare diseases that we don't have the solution for .PERIOD <BREAK>
i don't think we need to be convinced of that .PERIOD i think we know ;SEMICOLON in fact ,COMMA i think we know so much ,COMMA and it's such a reality that we care so deeply ,COMMA that in fact ,COMMA what usually stops us is that we're afraid to try and to mess up ,COMMA because we care so very much about helping each other and being meaningful in each other's lives .PERIOD <BREAK>
now that's a good characteristic .PERIOD <BREAK>
d :COLON good to have you with us ,COMMA brent .PERIOD <BREAK>
because maybe we can glean information -- not just how to move people up to the average ,COMMA but how we can move the entire average up in our companies and schools worldwide .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the mater has some scales and puts it all together .PERIOD <BREAK>
because ultimately ,COMMA that electoral outcome had nothing to do with the rest of the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's just two drops ,COMMA like that .PERIOD <BREAK>
so the camera's black and white .PERIOD <BREAK>
add that together with the gas ,COMMA and it's $ <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> per year ,COMMA just for that sign in each direction .PERIOD <BREAK>
and when we think about the classic image of the scientist in the lab ,COMMA we have this image -- you know ,COMMA they're pouring over the microscope ,COMMA and they see something in the tissue sample .PERIOD <BREAK>
three questions ,COMMA for me ,COMMA are key .PERIOD <BREAK>
but al jazeera took the voice from these people and we amplified [it] .PERIOD <BREAK>
while you're pushing the clock ,COMMA there's a few rules to obey .PERIOD <BREAK>
in all our treatments ,COMMA the patient holds a stop sonication button .PERIOD <BREAK>
this may seem minor ,COMMA but it is terrifying to hear rumor after rumor after rumor that another tidal wave ,COMMA bigger than the last ,COMMA will be coming at exactly <NUM> p .PERIOD m .PERIOD or perhaps tonight ,COMMA or perhaps .PERIOD <BREAK>
i borrow my friends' children ,COMMA so take all this advice with a grain of salt .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA i'll plug that in .PERIOD <BREAK>
so you have to do something like this .PERIOD <BREAK>
now i'm not advocating for bullies .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so he went right in there and started interviewing people .PERIOD <BREAK>
but you clamp this thing on my head ,COMMA and something happens .PERIOD <BREAK>
i could have taken him to new york ,COMMA and he would have died in a day .PERIOD <BREAK>
in fact ,COMMA molecules are able to vibrate at a set of frequencies which are very specific for each molecule and for the bonds connecting them .PERIOD <BREAK>
and in between those slits were the saddest eyes i've ever seen .PERIOD <BREAK>
i could hear it ,COMMA but i dared not to move .PERIOD i didn't move .PERIOD <BREAK>
which part of this don't you like ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
then ,COMMA if in that framework ,COMMA you take a bunch of theoreticians .PERIOD <BREAK>
there're a lot of elements .PERIOD <BREAK>
we created a website .PERIOD <BREAK>
they decide what to do .PERIOD <BREAK>
so what really matters are the more right-brained creative ,COMMA conceptual kinds of abilities .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's a strange thing to think about ,COMMA that on <NUM> / <NUM> ,COMMA when that tragedy happened ,COMMA <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> americans died .PERIOD <BREAK>
it is ,COMMA first of all ,COMMA profoundly unequal :COLON half the world's people still living on less than two dollars a day ;SEMICOLON a billion people with no access to clean water ;SEMICOLON two and a half billion no access to sanitation ;SEMICOLON a billion going to bed hungry every night ;SEMICOLON one in four deaths every year from aids ,COMMA tb ,COMMA malaria and the variety of infections associated with dirty water -- <NUM> percent of them under five years of age .PERIOD <BREAK>
and let me tell you right now ,COMMA it's fine that we would all be very happy with speech .PERIOD <BREAK>
i have all the press clippings of those four magnificent minutes ,COMMA because i don't want to forget them when old age destroys my brain cells .PERIOD <BREAK>
stay in .PERIOD <BREAK>
and there's something nice about slides getting stuck .PERIOD <BREAK>
i get asked two questions about this project .PERIOD <BREAK>
there was ,COMMA however ,COMMA an incident i'm going to tell you about ,COMMA that perhaps could have led me suspect something .PERIOD <BREAK>
i was very excited .PERIOD i walked with him to his office .PERIOD <BREAK>
we made a guess .PERIOD the guess was that schools in remote areas do not have good enough teachers .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is kanzi .PERIOD <BREAK>
but unfortunately ,COMMA the ocean is opaque ,COMMA and we can't see what's going on .PERIOD <BREAK>
today ,COMMA the depletion of ocean fisheries is so significant that effectively it is effecting the ability of the poor ,COMMA the artisanal fisher folk and those who fish for their own livelihoods ,COMMA to feed their families .PERIOD <BREAK>
so this also has to be done in a decentralized way .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i think we have a tendency to make each other feel guilty .PERIOD <BREAK>
but i'm doing it now ,COMMA and i'm going to tell you about it .PERIOD <BREAK>
we need to inspire them ,COMMA because they need to lead us and help us survive in the future .PERIOD <BREAK>
we would decide to establish this charter of compassion .PERIOD <BREAK>
and then i went in ,COMMA and measured all the geometry because i figured ,COMMA hey ,COMMA biomimicry .PERIOD <BREAK>
here is the problem :COLON at <NUM> dollars a barrel ,COMMA which we were in six months ago ,COMMA the u .PERIOD s .PERIOD spent a ton of money to get oil .PERIOD <BREAK>
all of this information is saved in a database that collects about <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> feelings a day .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i think it's particularly painful for us now in the west in the grips of what i sometimes think of as a control-z culture -- control-z like the computer command ,COMMA undo .PERIOD <BREAK>
so not only that i'm giving this information here and there ,COMMA but now there's a third party ,COMMA an independent third party ,COMMA my bank ,COMMA that's verifying that ,COMMA yes indeed ,COMMA i was there at this time .PERIOD <BREAK>
so it's a little bit like star wars ,COMMA you know ,COMMA but it's real .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it's my feeling and it's my urging being here to know that ,COMMA as we women move forward as the communicators of this ,COMMA but also as the ones who carry that burden of carrying the children ,COMMA bearing the children ,COMMA we hold most of the buying power in the household ,COMMA is that it's going to be us moving forward to carry the work of tyrone and other scientists around the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
and turns out they liked it ,COMMA and it made them happy -- not very happy ,COMMA but a little bit of happy .PERIOD <BREAK>
and juggling -- the balls cross and all that .PERIOD <BREAK>
you drink it in peril of your life .PERIOD <BREAK>
but of course ,COMMA this is a passive tail .PERIOD <BREAK>
my <NUM> th patent ;SEMICOLON about the <NUM> th invention .PERIOD <BREAK>
by the way ,COMMA they are hungry always .PERIOD <BREAK>
and sound places us in time as well ,COMMA because sound always has time embedded in it .PERIOD <BREAK>
who gets surgery and who doesn't ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
the red is modern conflict ,COMMA conflicts within states .PERIOD <BREAK>
now when the treasure sank in <NUM> ,COMMA it was the height of the best breeding season scientists had ever recorded for the african penguin -- which at the time ,COMMA was listed as a threatened species .PERIOD <BREAK>
my dad said ,COMMA why didn’t you do that when you were <NUM> ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
because we can't do it alone .PERIOD we have to do it together ,COMMA and together ,COMMA if we do this and share these ideas on play ,COMMA we can transform bulgaria for the better .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i started first with cow achilles tendon ,COMMA where we would take the cow achilles tendon ,COMMA which is type-i collagen ,COMMA strip it of its antigens by degrading it with an acid and detergent wash and forming it into a regeneration template .PERIOD <BREAK>
and these people are the people who take the brunt of it .PERIOD <BREAK>
and as soon as i said that ,COMMA i discovered that the word hat was hidden in the word whatever ,COMMA and that led me to the inevitable conclusion .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's between buildings .PERIOD <BREAK>
so this is actually a new generation .PERIOD <BREAK>
so the first one -- the most famous appointment dynamic in the world -- is something called happy hour .PERIOD <BREAK>
you know ,COMMA we've seen that -- we've got things on hypertext on cd-roms .PERIOD <BREAK>
you know ,COMMA the problem is if this virus occasionally mutates so dramatically ,COMMA it essentially is a new virus and then we get a pandemic .PERIOD <BREAK>
eventually ,COMMA i created a whole structure based on symbolic programming and so on that let me build mathematica .PERIOD <BREAK>
technology will bring you out of poverty ,COMMA but there's a need for a market to get away from poverty .PERIOD <BREAK>
but idealism allied with pragmatism ,COMMA with rolling up your sleeves and making the world bend a bit ,COMMA is very exciting .PERIOD it's very real .PERIOD it's very strong .PERIOD <BREAK>
so where did he get the one in <NUM> million number ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and in the three years that i was finance minister ,COMMA they made an average of <NUM> million dollars profit per year .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the second thing ,COMMA which has stayed with me ,COMMA which became my philosophy of life ,COMMA which made all the difference ,COMMA is :COLON <NUM> things happen in your life ,COMMA good or bad .PERIOD <BREAK>
time perspective is the study of how individuals ,COMMA all of us ,COMMA divide the flow of your human experience into time zones or time categories .PERIOD <BREAK>
and he viewed proto-shamanism as a kind of original attempt ,COMMA through ritual ,COMMA to rekindle a connection that had been irrevocably lost .PERIOD <BREAK>
we get a visual pattern of what these nine-year-olds called acceleration .PERIOD <BREAK>
so as i continue to be a member of parliament and as i continue listening to all of you talking about botany ,COMMA talking about health ,COMMA talking about democracy ,COMMA talking about new inventions ,COMMA i'm hoping that one day in my own little community -- which is <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> square kilometers ,COMMA maybe five times the size of rhode island -- with no roads ,COMMA we'll be able to become a model to help others develop .PERIOD <BREAK>
why is this ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
can you believe that ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
we do what that group does that we're trying to identify with .PERIOD <BREAK>
we're cooking from scratch every day .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's what's known as a bioluminescent burglar alarm ,COMMA and just like the alarm on your car or your house ,COMMA it's meant to cast unwanted attention onto the intruder ,COMMA thereby either leading to his capture or scaring him away .PERIOD <BREAK>
that's an in-joke ,COMMA by the way .PERIOD <BREAK>
what's the best way of communicating in the world today ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
this is keith haring looked at statistically .PERIOD <BREAK>
not really ,COMMA because if you looked at what happened in <NUM> ,COMMA the fire started .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i'm absolutely enthralled by biology .PERIOD <BREAK>
i am asking us to balance the idea of our complete vulnerability with the complete notion of transformation of what is possible .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's the largest ngo in education in the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
it has only on one side this big ,COMMA big glass window that helps to let the sunlight enter deep into the space and create a beautiful quality there and a great dynamic range .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is normal science .PERIOD <BREAK>
but as much as the small stuff stinks ,COMMA we needed somewhere to start ,COMMA so that we would have somewhere to go .PERIOD <BREAK>
it was a great success .PERIOD <BREAK>
my experience ,COMMA however ,COMMA in the islamic world is very different .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it should be a male victim ,COMMA that's the only thing .PERIOD <BREAK>
if you're low-income in the united states ,COMMA you have a higher chance of going to jail than you do of getting a four-year degree .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so they grabbed some very simple materials ,COMMA you can see ,COMMA and did this role-play ,COMMA this kind of very crude role-play ,COMMA just to get a sense of what it would be like for passengers if they were stuck in quite small places on airplanes .PERIOD <BREAK>
now ,COMMA i want you to put your data on the web .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so that was the idea .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the kind of science that can be done will be determined by a variety of scientists who want to be involved and can bring the instrumentation to the table .PERIOD <BREAK>
say stop .PERIOD <BREAK>
peres thought that was a great idea .PERIOD <BREAK>
that's it .PERIOD <BREAK>
then i went on to tear my acl ,COMMA the ligament in my knee ,COMMA and then developed an arthritic knee .PERIOD <BREAK>
now because it's student-driven ,COMMA there's some amazing things that the movement has done .PERIOD <BREAK>
and one of the most beautiful descriptions i've come across in this research of how minds interpenetrate was written by a great theorist and scientist named douglas hofstadter at the university of indiana .PERIOD <BREAK>
and from day to day ,COMMA we have the techniques that we use .PERIOD <BREAK>
and you can never replicate that performance twice .PERIOD <BREAK>
i was very glad to see goldie hawn ,COMMA because i had an apology to make to her .PERIOD <BREAK>
compare the chalk writing with the lexigram on the keyboard .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA you know ,COMMA i do what i can with the students .PERIOD <BREAK>
once each year ,COMMA the fastest young boy in each hamlet is given the honor of becoming a woman .PERIOD <BREAK>
so -- okay ,COMMA i can now see that man running out there ,COMMA and i can see that guy running out there .PERIOD <BREAK>
children have been trafficked from other conflict zones to come and work on the coffee plantations .PERIOD <BREAK>
right ,COMMA it was the first great republican president of the <NUM> th century who taught us about environmental thinking -- teddy roosevelt .PERIOD <BREAK>
you have a situation where the relationship between government and local social networking companies is creating a situation where ,COMMA effectively ,COMMA the empowering potential of these platforms is being constrained because of these relationships between companies and government .PERIOD <BREAK>
ipl became the biggest brand in india and ,COMMA because our elections ,COMMA had to be moved to south africa ,COMMA and we had to start the tournament in three weeks .PERIOD <BREAK>
they are quite brittle .PERIOD so you've only got a part of one there .PERIOD <BREAK>
you know ,COMMA so i could turn to pretty much any sage from shakespeare to stephen colbert to point out things like the fact that we're noble in reason and infinite in faculties and just kind of awesome-er than anything else on the planet when it comes to all things cerebral .PERIOD <BREAK>
and unless you've been on mars recently ,COMMA you know there's a lot of that out there .PERIOD <BREAK>
and this is a little bit freaky ,COMMA because what motts is seeing is actually this .PERIOD <BREAK>
i believe our only hope for the future is to adopt a new conception of human ecology ,COMMA one in which we start to reconstitute our conception of the richness of human capacity .PERIOD <BREAK>
and that's what i look at with my photographic work .PERIOD <BREAK>
or ,COMMA as nancy said before ,COMMA like really immerse oneself into it .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i said ,COMMA that might do the same thing ,COMMA whatever it is .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i'm very pleased to tell you that the building's done .PERIOD <BREAK>
but sometimes something happens that triggers a phase change .PERIOD <BREAK>
if we can somehow encourage these molecules to talk to each other and make the right shapes and compete ,COMMA they will start to form cells that will replicate and compete .PERIOD <BREAK>
but secondly ,COMMA i blame the queen because dictionaries have really not changed .PERIOD <BREAK>
and he noticed that for weddings and funerals there they could find enough money to put something together .PERIOD <BREAK>
so english mania is a turning point .PERIOD <BREAK>
and baron-cohen explained that certain disabilities can manifest themselves in the hacking and computing world as tremendous skills ,COMMA and that we should not be throwing in jail people who have such disabilities and skills because they have lost their way socially or been duped .PERIOD <BREAK>
and there is some truth to this ,COMMA in the sense that we have something of a finite resource ,COMMA and increased growth is going to push up demand for that .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is what i mean about appropriate technology .PERIOD <BREAK>
and we worked very closely with the whole thing being a team effort ,COMMA and with wonderful results like that flight .PERIOD <BREAK>
and when we were walking through the narrow alleys ,COMMA it was literally impossible not to step in the raw sewage and the garbage alongside the little homes .PERIOD <BREAK>
this might be what beck would be experiencing when he realizes he's in danger .PERIOD <BREAK>
so you go to the container store and spend an enormous amount of money ,COMMA and then you start this crazy sorting process that never -- it's just nuts .PERIOD <BREAK>
that's why i broke all the professional rules of conduct for an economist ,COMMA and i wrote an economics book that you could read on a beach .PERIOD <BREAK>
so how does it work ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
well ,COMMA i happened to have been very quick that day ,COMMA and i said ,COMMA yeah ,COMMA but a lot less baloney .PERIOD <BREAK>
but what happened was ,COMMA the rules changed ,COMMA and they never got to make partner .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i'd like to think of it as a <NUM> st century wisdom table ,COMMA really .PERIOD <BREAK>
for anyone here from brazil ,COMMA you'll know about this plant .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it's very ,COMMA very common for designers and people in the visual arts to feel that we're not contributing enough ,COMMA or worse ,COMMA that all we're doing is contributing to landfill .PERIOD <BREAK>
and this is an example of a very ,COMMA actually ,COMMA famous cluster ,COMMA the coma cluster .PERIOD <BREAK>
she simply said to him ,COMMA abraham ,COMMA i'm going away from you now ,COMMA and i shall never return .PERIOD <BREAK>
and openings seemed -- everyone loves opening bridges ,COMMA but it's quite a basic thing .PERIOD <BREAK>
kermit means nothing to me .PERIOD <BREAK>
the reason i'm doing that is because those are going to be the areas that are the most significant to us .PERIOD <BREAK>
and then i find this -- all the evidence available in the biological sciences supports the core proposition that the cosmos is especially designed whole with life and mankind as its fundamental goal and purpose ,COMMA a whole in which all facets of reality have their meaning and explanation in this central fact .PERIOD <BREAK>
in fact ,COMMA they funded it for that very reason .PERIOD <BREAK>
because they help people share news .PERIOD <BREAK>
if it were los angeles ,COMMA is it the mayor ,COMMA the governor ,COMMA the president of the united states ,COMMA the head of homeland security ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
so the baobabs ,COMMA as they get older ,COMMA tend to get pulpy in their centers and hollow out .PERIOD <BREAK>
and he explained to me that ,COMMA when i shave ,COMMA i have little black dots on the left side of my face where the hair is ,COMMA but on the right side of my face i was badly burned so i have no hair ,COMMA and this creates lack of symmetry .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA you know ,COMMA that leads to questions like ,COMMA is this a compiler ?QUESTIONMARK is this a sub-routine ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
okay ,COMMA when i say three ,COMMA we move .PERIOD <BREAK>
and they're literally unable to strike or they will self-destruct .PERIOD <BREAK>
recently ,COMMA diving off -- in the gulf of mexico ,COMMA finding pools of water ,COMMA this time not upside down ,COMMA right side up .PERIOD <BREAK>
we've discovered over <NUM> in the last <NUM> years ,COMMA including the small planet ,COMMA announced earlier this week ,COMMA which has a radius just twice the size of the earth .PERIOD <BREAK>
in fact ,COMMA if we count all the individual organisms ,COMMA we would come at much larger numbers .PERIOD <BREAK>
if you want to become a fossil ,COMMA you actually need to die somewhere where your bones will be rapidly buried .PERIOD <BREAK>
that reaches <NUM> kilometers into the sky .PERIOD <BREAK>
the question is not ,COMMA is psycho milt a good employee ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
so with two designers ,COMMA tolga and christina ,COMMA at my office ,COMMA we took a track -- many of you probably know it .PERIOD it’s about <NUM> years old ,COMMA and it's david byrne and brian eno -- and we did this little animation .PERIOD <BREAK>
where are they ?QUESTIONMARK where are those ripples ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
you look at your x-rays on a screen and you do stuff with them ,COMMA you email them .PERIOD but we were still using x-rays ,COMMA but we didn't even have a viewing box !EXCLAMATIONMARK <BREAK>
a malnourished child being measured as part of the supplemental feeding program .PERIOD <BREAK>

we're not talking about the harry potter end ,COMMA right at the left side .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i can go on .PERIOD dollars ,COMMA on and on ,COMMA into the system .PERIOD <BREAK>
would he need the same language as a lawyer ,COMMA for example ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
it's a clinic like a health clinic at any other university ,COMMA except people come to the clinic with environmental health concerns ,COMMA and they walk out with prescriptions for things they can do to improve environmental health ,COMMA as opposed to coming to a clinic with medical concerns and walking out with prescriptions for pharmaceuticals .PERIOD <BREAK>
it will bring all of your family together .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is exploring geometry and the rhythm of shape .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the neat thing about it is ,COMMA is that it's also reprogrammable .PERIOD <BREAK>
the magical moment ,COMMA the magical moment of conducting .PERIOD <BREAK>
so economists talk about game theory -- that every two-person game has a nash equilibrium .PERIOD <BREAK>
in six months ,COMMA how do we train these women ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
if you were to reward doctors for doing more procedures -- which is the current system -- they would do more .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i decided ,COMMA it was an old dream that was lingering ,COMMA that was from so many years ago ,COMMA three decades ago -- the only sort of world class swim i had tried and failed at back in my <NUM> s -- was going from cuba to florida .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA you're not going to find them in rural areas of developing countries .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's interesting because he rejected the aristotelian premise underlying the majority's opinion .PERIOD <BREAK>
you can't see an awful lot .PERIOD you can just see ,COMMA there's a yellow ribbon tied to one of my ski poles .PERIOD <BREAK>
we were hoping that it wass going to have a kind of evil ,COMMA spidery walk ,COMMA but instead it created this pretty lame way of moving forward .PERIOD <BREAK>
i said ,COMMA a day !EXCLAMATIONMARK how long does it take them to fall off ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
prisoners are still born into prisoner-of-war camps long after the guards are gone .PERIOD <BREAK>
now we may not agree with what religions are trying to teach us ,COMMA but we can admire the institutional way in which they're doing it .PERIOD <BREAK>
you see <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> representative species ,COMMA and you can see where we are .PERIOD <BREAK>
he'd just been diagnosed with als ,COMMA which is a disease that the average lifespan is three years .PERIOD <BREAK>
going back in time ,COMMA there was a lady called valerie larkin ,COMMA and in <NUM> ,COMMA she had all our information on one disk .PERIOD <BREAK>
of course ,COMMA camera angle is everything .PERIOD the photographer is over there ,COMMA and this board appears to overlap with this one ,COMMA and this one with that one ,COMMA and so on .PERIOD <BREAK>
and there's one thing ,COMMA one small challenge that i have for you ,COMMA and should make us reflect on the importance of storytelling .PERIOD <BREAK>
then we went to crp test .PERIOD <BREAK>
we did face <NUM> face with only six friends ,COMMA two ladders ,COMMA two brushes ,COMMA a rented car ,COMMA a camera and <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> square feet of paper .PERIOD <BREAK>
the whole process is very sensitive to temperature and humidity .PERIOD <BREAK>
i want you to estimate the height of the building .PERIOD <BREAK>
then when they degrade ,COMMA what do you do with them ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
we then dug a big hole to put in a rainwater catchment tank to take our yard water independent .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is especially important for extroverted children too .PERIOD <BREAK>
is there any doubt that this question has an answer ,COMMA and that it matters ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
sometimes i think the fates must grin as we denounce them and insist the only reason we can't win ,COMMA is the fates themselves that miss .PERIOD <BREAK>
and that got me to go out and look at mines like this ,COMMA and go out and look at the largest industrial incursions in the landscape that i could find .PERIOD <BREAK>
how do we use technology to make this day echo into the future ,COMMA so that we can build community and have these communities working together ,COMMA through the internet ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and the waiter can come by and say ,COMMA would you like more water ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
miko :COLON i don't think so .PERIOD <BREAK>
that means each of you will contain on a cd your entire gene code .PERIOD <BREAK>
the value of nothing :COLON out of nothing comes something .PERIOD <BREAK>
you never run out of that companion as you drink this wine ,COMMA too .PERIOD <BREAK>

people will send you donations when you're in that condition .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA very cool .PERIOD <BREAK>
i mean ,COMMA the city's the best gallery i could imagine .PERIOD <BREAK>
we've applied tumor treating fields to over <NUM> different cancers in the lab ,COMMA and we see this effect in all of them .PERIOD <BREAK>
thank you ,COMMA evan ,COMMA you're a wonderful ,COMMA wonderful example of the technology .PERIOD <BREAK>
and yet ,COMMA they always manage to to get the result that they want .PERIOD <BREAK>
if you were to walk into one of these rooms ,COMMA you would see this .PERIOD <BREAK>
mice and men are the same .PERIOD wives know that ,COMMA but anyway .PERIOD <BREAK>
the proscenium can fly .PERIOD <BREAK>
well ,COMMA today ,COMMA i'd like to show you that through thinking differently ,COMMA the problem has been solved .PERIOD <BREAK>
and we'll call this a wheel .PERIOD <BREAK>
and you can create parts with moving components ,COMMA hinges ,COMMA parts within parts .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is a helicopter medic giving cpr to a soldier who had been shot in the head .PERIOD <BREAK>
so people imagine the nervous system is just like that .PERIOD <BREAK>
a human judge has a conversation with a human and a computer .PERIOD <BREAK>
you can imagine with this big surface of a skysurfing board ,COMMA there is a lot of force ,COMMA a lot of power .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the image of the dvd here is just to illustrate a point that silk follows very subtle topographies of the surface ,COMMA which means that it can replicate features on the nanoscale .PERIOD <BREAK>
they do not have good enough infrastructure .PERIOD <BREAK>
two examples ,COMMA again ,COMMA of how these reserves can benefit people .PERIOD <BREAK>
because she'd be like ,COMMA you know -- she'd get on the phone .PERIOD <BREAK>
this morning ,COMMA the temperature of the english channel was <NUM> degrees .PERIOD <BREAK>

tuesday night it's school violence and bullying .PERIOD <BREAK>
this shows one of the most extreme caves that we work in .PERIOD <BREAK>
so vivian and i have been working together for <NUM> years .PERIOD <BREAK>
it did help by promoting observation and experiment .PERIOD <BREAK>
we recognize that the only way to bridge the gap between the rich and poor countries is through education and technology .PERIOD <BREAK>
and of course ,COMMA this task has material dimensions .PERIOD <BREAK>
now i want you to look at that dot between the green and the red .PERIOD okay ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
that's <NUM> percent of the co <NUM> emissions across their entire country .PERIOD <BREAK>

they are more expensive in places like north america .PERIOD <BREAK>
once ,COMMA when she was driving ,COMMA or rather ,COMMA her husband was driving ,COMMA the road divided into four and she felt herself going simultaneously up four roads .PERIOD <BREAK>
and that's what i'm going to talk about ,COMMA how a small change leads to a very big revolution .PERIOD <BREAK>
and finally ,COMMA the sugar palm forest takes over and provides the people with permanent income .PERIOD <BREAK>
so this weighs a little more than a tenth of a pound .PERIOD <BREAK>
now ,COMMA if you think i'm exaggerating at all in this ,COMMA all you have to do is substitute something else ,COMMA like indonesian .PERIOD <BREAK>
watch this -- i'm not touching any buttons ,COMMA ladies and gentlemen .PERIOD <BREAK>

what i wanted to show you is that scientists ,COMMA using their from-the-outside ,COMMA third-person methods ,COMMA can tell you things about your own consciousness that you would never dream of ,COMMA and that ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA you're not the authority on your own consciousness that you think you are .PERIOD <BREAK>

we're looking for this behavior among white voters or ,COMMA really ,COMMA non-black voters .PERIOD <BREAK>

all the points ,COMMA all the lines -- it's incredible .PERIOD <BREAK>
this was a piece on tourism in the united states .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA the model works ,COMMA but it's only the tip of the iceberg ,COMMA because my second idea is that it's not enough just to want to make music in something like guitar hero .PERIOD <BREAK>
put your money where you mouth is .PERIOD <BREAK>
we said ,COMMA take one idea ,COMMA anything that bothers you ,COMMA choose one week ,COMMA and change a billion lives .PERIOD <BREAK>

and he went ,COMMA furthermore ,COMMA i'm a priest myself .PERIOD <BREAK>
maybe it's a problem of the political culture ,COMMA and we have to think about how to change that political culture .PERIOD <BREAK>

what i find fascinating is that we've actually wired our world to share ,COMMA whether that's our neighborhood ,COMMA our school ,COMMA our office ,COMMA or our facebook network ,COMMA and that's creating an economy of what's mine is yours .PERIOD <BREAK>
they weigh thousands of pounds ,COMMA are not by any means agile .PERIOD <BREAK>
second ,COMMA i call this the mixer .PERIOD <BREAK>
and people who live in cities in the developed world tend to be very prosperous ,COMMA and thus use a lot of stuff .PERIOD <BREAK>
so in order to do that ,COMMA i founded a charter called gua africa ,COMMA where we put kids in school .PERIOD <BREAK>
people did not believe this .PERIOD <BREAK>
so let's get a sense of what is happening in this part of the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
i turn to my wife and said ,COMMA who are we buying this for ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
no life ,COMMA from the smallest life to everybody here ,COMMA would be possible without these little micro-machines .PERIOD <BREAK>
so for example ,COMMA in the case of ticketmaster ,COMMA the reason you have to type these distorted characters is to prevent scalpers from writing a program that can buy millions of tickets ,COMMA two at a time .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i say ,COMMA well ,COMMA that's interesting .PERIOD that's not what i do .PERIOD <BREAK>
it was a bit of a road stopper ,COMMA which was problematic because the police kept on trying to clear away the crowds ,COMMA but huge fun -- it was great for me to do a performance .PERIOD <BREAK>

as we heard earlier ,COMMA movement is very important in these kinds of living systems .PERIOD <BREAK>
i thought it would be creepy to hear my own voice coming from a computer .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's an assumption that modernity is a product simply of competition ,COMMA markets and technology .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i ate the disliked ones first ,COMMA because the ones you like ,COMMA you want to save .PERIOD <BREAK>
and where do people live ?QUESTIONMARK near water .PERIOD <BREAK>

we're using whatever leverage we have to bring them to the table .PERIOD <BREAK>
although ,COMMA god knows ,COMMA of late ,COMMA in our hubris ,COMMA we seem to have drifted away .PERIOD <BREAK>
when i started this chair it was not a preconceived notion .PERIOD <BREAK>
we humans are earth's pandoran species .PERIOD <BREAK>
now -- and i think since the public theater ,COMMA i must have done more than a dozen cultural identities for major institutions ,COMMA and i don't think i ever -- i ever grasped that seriousness again -- i do them for very big ,COMMA important institutions in new york city .PERIOD <BREAK>
so what i did is i opened up a hotline -- a hotline where people could leave voicemails of their pain ,COMMA not necessarily related to that event .PERIOD <BREAK>
i see pictures ,COMMA and something says ,COMMA now ,COMMA that's compassion .PERIOD <BREAK>
think of the collective anger in tahrir square ,COMMA which brought down a dictator .PERIOD <BREAK>

okay ,COMMA we're naive ,COMMA we're bright-eyed and bushy-tailed .PERIOD <BREAK>
this heat map is going to show you how the brain of the system works .PERIOD <BREAK>
and by whom ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and a lot of people ,COMMA when they think about the future ,COMMA think about it linearly .PERIOD <BREAK>
and this was an important thing about <NUM> th century technology ,COMMA that all these relationships among parts could make the most brilliant idea fall apart ,COMMA even when judged by the most expert people .PERIOD <BREAK>
one of the neurological conditions that can be treated with focused ultrasound are movement disorders ,COMMA like parkinson's or essential tremor .PERIOD <BREAK>
and on your right you have a dependent public which is pathetically grateful for anything you give it .PERIOD <BREAK>
see ,COMMA i think of calculating ,COMMA in a sense ,COMMA as the machinery of math .PERIOD <BREAK>
we thought it would be really neat to do that ,COMMA and one of the problems we really were worried about is :COLON how do we get legal on the sidewalk ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
so ,COMMA what happened is ,COMMA a graduate student in china ,COMMA lulu qian ,COMMA did a great job .PERIOD <BREAK>
think of it in terms of diabetes ,COMMA for instance .PERIOD <BREAK>
that's the beauty of randomization .PERIOD <BREAK>
doesn't it feel good to say it out loud ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
meanwhile ,COMMA as all of this is happening ,COMMA by the mid-' <NUM> s ,COMMA the business model of traditional broadcasting and cinema has been busted completely .PERIOD <BREAK>

they vaccinated the kids .PERIOD they get better water .PERIOD <BREAK>
actually ,COMMA one indication is that little boy on my husband's shoulders has just graduated from high school .PERIOD <BREAK>
it'll survive her .PERIOD <BREAK>
now ,COMMA anything coming at all ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>

it was a little bit too funky ,COMMA and we wanted a more feminine point of view and employed a duck who did it in a much more fitting way -- fashion .PERIOD <BREAK>
so i'm going to show you now a little experiment that we did .PERIOD <BREAK>
every time i look at this piece ,COMMA i always wonder if my mom's whispering to my dad ,COMMA he finally folded his laundry .PERIOD <BREAK>
because people don't have tools to cope with it ,COMMA to get over it .PERIOD <BREAK>
for some of the subjects ,COMMA sitting in the far corner of a room is a box of godiva chocolates ,COMMA and for others is a can of spam .PERIOD <BREAK>

the key to surviving a nuclear blast is getting out ,COMMA and not going into harm's way .PERIOD <BREAK>
so let me just leave you with three things .PERIOD <BREAK>

but ,COMMA in a way ,COMMA the computer makes possible much more than what most people think ,COMMA and my art has just been about trying to find a personal way of using the computer ,COMMA and so i end up writing software to do that .PERIOD <BREAK>
because ,COMMA as you can see ,COMMA it was crescent shaped .PERIOD <BREAK>
but where i really learned about octopus was in the field ,COMMA as a filmmaker making films with them ,COMMA where you're allowed to spend large periods of time with the animals ,COMMA seeing octopus being octopus in their ocean homes .PERIOD <BREAK>
think about it .PERIOD yes .PERIOD the answer is :COLON i had a girlfriend .PERIOD what ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>

i realized my job was to awaken possibility in other people .PERIOD <BREAK>
the wireless watch flopped miserably in the market ,COMMA but it wasn't because it wasn't simply and beautifully designed .PERIOD <BREAK>
so it was a little slow ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
now ,COMMA there's no time to get into the benefits of eating plants here ,COMMA but the evidence is that plants -- and i want to make this clear -- it's not the ingredients in plants ,COMMA it's the plants .PERIOD <BREAK>

there are two orders of magnitude more spiders than primates .PERIOD <BREAK>

we're very excited about the progress ,COMMA we do have a very long way to go though still ,COMMA and let me tell you a little bit more about that .PERIOD <BREAK>
but after that ,COMMA i actually had my own lab in the computational neuroscience department ,COMMA and i wasn't doing any neuroscience .PERIOD <BREAK>
so a few years ago ,COMMA l .PERIOD a .PERIOD county decided that they needed to spend <NUM> .PERIOD <NUM> billion dollars to repair the city schools .PERIOD <BREAK>

there's an interesting marketing lesson from it ,COMMA which is basically ,COMMA when you market a product ,COMMA you can either say ,COMMA this is going to be wonderful ,COMMA it will make you feel better and enliven you .PERIOD <BREAK>
but even in this concertinaed cosmic perspective ,COMMA our century is very ,COMMA very special ,COMMA the first when humans can change themselves and their home planet .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it's an example of living and working together .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's actually a scottish piece i've chosen .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's not the material goods we want .PERIOD it's the rewards we want .PERIOD <BREAK>
and one of the things that i think is important is that we have to get away from this idea of designing the machines manually ,COMMA but actually let them evolve and learn ,COMMA like children ,COMMA and perhaps that's the way we'll get there .PERIOD thank you .PERIOD <BREAK>
if you mosquito-proof houses ,COMMA when people get sick ,COMMA they're sitting in bed -- or in mosquito-proof hospitals ,COMMA they're sitting in a hospital bed -- and the mosquitoes can't get to them .PERIOD <BREAK>
and her answer shocked me .PERIOD it stunned me .PERIOD <BREAK>

if you try to change the rules in the nation ,COMMA you can't give some people a chance to hold back ,COMMA see how things turn out ,COMMA and let others zoom ahead and try the new rules .PERIOD <BREAK>
what we discovered is whether you look at the leg of a human like richard ,COMMA or a cockroach ,COMMA or a crab ,COMMA or a kangaroo ,COMMA the relative leg stiffness of that spring is the same for everything we've seen so far .PERIOD <BREAK>

the steel industry is so far ahead of the design industry that if you take advantage of it you can even start to think of beams and columns all rolled together into a single system which is highly efficient ,COMMA but also produces decorative effects and formal effects that are very beautiful and organic .PERIOD <BREAK>
now what i learned from her ,COMMA is a woman ,COMMA not only who could be so generous under these present circumstances and what it was then ,COMMA and what was being done to her son ,COMMA but the life she's had .PERIOD <BREAK>
that was a good one .PERIOD <BREAK>

i'm an infectious disease physician ,COMMA and in the early days of hiv ,COMMA before we had our medications ,COMMA i presided over so many scenes like this .PERIOD <BREAK>
so that's exactly what i'm going to ask you to do ,COMMA but in a slightly different way .PERIOD you're going to combine it .PERIOD <BREAK>
these are subjects coming to an experiment to be asked the simplest of all questions :COLON how much will you enjoy eating potato chips one minute from now ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
so it's a really strange business model compared to coming from a toy company .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so you must ask yourself the question :COLON how is it possible in the <NUM> st century that we graduate children from schools who can't read the diplomas that they have in their hands ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
listen to politicians now ,COMMA with their comprehensive <NUM> -point plans .PERIOD <BREAK>

and i could spend the rest of my time ,COMMA which is getting very limited ,COMMA going through this litany of concerns about the ocean ,COMMA but i want to end on a more positive note .PERIOD <BREAK>
we need it to keep social stability .PERIOD <BREAK>
then i tried typing words on my laptop and using its built in voice .PERIOD <BREAK>

in fact ,COMMA on twitter ,COMMA there were a number of people who were supportive of the revolution who said ,COMMA well actually ,COMMA we do want democracy and free expression ,COMMA but there is some kinds of speech that need to be off-bounds because it's too violent and it might be destabilizing for our democracy .PERIOD <BREAK>
now like with anything that's really different from the status quo ,COMMA it didn't always go so well testing that aircraft .PERIOD <BREAK>
you don't need everyone .PERIOD <BREAK>
if you have a uti ,COMMA you've probably -- or ever had a uti -- you've come in contact with this little bug .PERIOD <BREAK>
these things that look like whiskers that are sticking out from either side are the dynamic scaffolding of the cell .PERIOD <BREAK>
this family earns about one dollar per day .PERIOD <BREAK>
and then finally ,COMMA in l .PERIOD a .PERIOD i was asked to do a sculpture at the foot of interstate bank tower ,COMMA the highest building in l .PERIOD a .PERIOD <BREAK>
india still has a long way to go to catch up with china .PERIOD <BREAK>
thank you very much .PERIOD <BREAK>
i started doing fashion .PERIOD <BREAK>
and that's what we're trying to do .PERIOD <BREAK>
it does not mean that i don't have values or beliefs ,COMMA but it does mean i am not hardened around them .PERIOD <BREAK>
so our cost for this was less than <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> dollars ,COMMA all right .PERIOD <BREAK>
attendees at meetings don't know when they'll get back to the task that they left at their desk .PERIOD <BREAK>
it was about <NUM> years ago when i discovered free falling .PERIOD <BREAK>

it was due to a russian mathematical physicist ,COMMA and it was a complicated theory .PERIOD <BREAK>
there's no american compassion .PERIOD <BREAK>
and we run our companies like this ,COMMA by the way .PERIOD <BREAK>
there's the atomic-force microscope working and you can see that the landing's a little rough .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i decided that if i was good in art ,COMMA and i was good in mathematics ,COMMA i'd study architecture ,COMMA which was the blending of the two .PERIOD <BREAK>
if you look here ,COMMA here's linux in red ,COMMA and it's hit <NUM> percent .PERIOD <BREAK>

they've got to go hunting for seasonal rain .PERIOD <BREAK>
and why are they so similar ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
in the midst of all this amazing technology ,COMMA and all these things that are occurring ,COMMA it's really interesting because there is sort of a counter-revolution that is going on :COLON a resurgence of interest in remedies from the past ,COMMA in nutraceuticals ,COMMA in all of these sorts of things that some people ,COMMA in the pharmaceutical industry particularly ,COMMA like to brand as non-science .PERIOD <BREAK>
that's one of the deadliest diseases known to humans .PERIOD <BREAK>
also in the bible ,COMMA one sees that the death penalty was the accepted punishment for crimes such as homosexuality ,COMMA adultery ,COMMA blasphemy ,COMMA idolatry ,COMMA talking back to your parents -- -- and picking up sticks on the sabbath .PERIOD <BREAK>
we move along the wall ,COMMA in what's called proximity operations ,COMMA looking for changes in color .PERIOD <BREAK>
and ,COMMA after actually two months of preparation ,COMMA we built our camps all the way up the mountain .PERIOD <BREAK>
and every time they do that ,COMMA they get a tiny little packet of energy .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's not that hard a problem .PERIOD <BREAK>
it was our last resort .PERIOD <BREAK>
if you're here today -- and i'm very happy that you are -- you've all heard about how sustainable development will save us from ourselves .PERIOD however ,COMMA when we're not at ted ,COMMA we are often told that a real sustainability policy agenda is just not feasible ,COMMA especially in large ,COMMA urban areas like new york city .PERIOD <BREAK>
i walked into the new york times offices and did card tricks to everybody .PERIOD <BREAK>
and we're entering an era of really ,COMMA truly scarless surgery called notes ,COMMA where the robotic endoscope can come out the stomach and pull out that gallbladder all in a scarless way and robotically .PERIOD <BREAK>
and pretty much never did .PERIOD <BREAK>
we're going to talk about that some more .PERIOD <BREAK>
when i was growing up ,COMMA i was exposed to making and crafts and materials and invention on a small scale .PERIOD <BREAK>
it failed partly because the courts are too passive ,COMMA partly because the legislatures are corrupted ,COMMA by which i don't mean that there's bribery operating to stop real change ,COMMA but more the economy of influence that governs how congress functions means that policymakers here will not understand this until it's too late to fix it .PERIOD <BREAK>
and out of that sense of failure ,COMMA i remember ,COMMA i would always examine the patient .PERIOD <BREAK>
at the moment ,COMMA he's in the park ,COMMA and you are competing with smells ,COMMA and other dogs ,COMMA and squirrels .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the delta has alligators crawling in and out of rivers filled with fish and cypress trees dripping with snakes ,COMMA birds of every flavor .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i went to the it guys here and a gentleman mended my computer ,COMMA and then he said ,COMMA what are you doing here ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
we saw no other mass mortality events .PERIOD <BREAK>
but over a five- to <NUM> -year period ,COMMA we will take down the need for outside assistance and eventually it will be phased out .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's filled with this toxic gas ,COMMA hydrogen sulfide .PERIOD <BREAK>
so this takes care of my age .PERIOD <BREAK>

in social aspect of his life he was just like a child ,COMMA he was not at all matured .PERIOD <BREAK>
and they tend to be on their own .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the newly emerging diseases may make h <NUM> n <NUM> and bird flu a quaint forerunner of things to come .PERIOD it's a destabilized world .PERIOD <BREAK>
and that's where we're failing ,COMMA and that's where we need the face transplant .PERIOD <BREAK>
we've also along the way discovered that this is a very old molecule ,COMMA that all of the dna in your body has been around forever ,COMMA since the beginning of us ,COMMA of us as creatures .PERIOD <BREAK>
and we can use this system to test dietary factors at concentrations that are obtainable by eating .PERIOD <BREAK>
that's the devil speaking .PERIOD <BREAK>
in fact ,COMMA nature has solved it many ,COMMA many times .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's harmful because it produces a toxin ,COMMA and that toxin is released when the organism gets into our intestinal tract .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i'm amazed nobody asked her that question when she was confirmed .PERIOD <BREAK>
so they asked us to make a new coumarin .PERIOD and so we started doing calculations .PERIOD <BREAK>
they have to subvert tradition that once silenced them in order to give voice to new aspirations .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i said ,COMMA so ,COMMA could you do it right here ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
i believe these six factors -- the rise of the notion of population as human capital ,COMMA the rise of indian entrepreneurs ,COMMA the rise of english as a language of aspiration ,COMMA technology as something empowering ,COMMA globalization as a positive factor ,COMMA and the deepening of democracy -- has contributed to why india is today growing at rates it has never seen before .PERIOD <BREAK>
predicated on plumb level ,COMMA square and centered .PERIOD <BREAK>
and why do i say it ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
they are the same .PERIOD okay ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
if i were here playing cello ,COMMA or playing on a synth ,COMMA or sharing my music with you ,COMMA i'd be able to show things about myself that i can't tell you in words ,COMMA more personal things ,COMMA perhaps deeper things .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so we did just the opposite .PERIOD <BREAK>
one time i wrote a column about my efforts to reach dell technical support ,COMMA and within <NUM> hours there were <NUM> messages from readers on the feedback boards on the times website ,COMMA from users saying ,COMMA me too !EXCLAMATIONMARK and ,COMMA here's my tale of woe .PERIOD i call it software rage .PERIOD <BREAK>
reductive listening is listening for .PERIOD <BREAK>
here's a really short text .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the best we can muster up is ,COMMA i don't know .PERIOD it just doesn't feel right .PERIOD <BREAK>
and then i found another list in one of my diaries that actually contained all the things that i thought i learned in my life so far .PERIOD <BREAK>
and we put them in ,COMMA and what you see immediately is that there are waves and waves of innovation .PERIOD <BREAK>
these cells ,COMMA called glial cells ,COMMA were once thought to be unimportant structural elements of the spinal cord that did nothing more than hold all the important things together ,COMMA like the nerves .PERIOD <BREAK>
i was also inspired by walt whitman ,COMMA who wanted to absorb america and have it absorb him .PERIOD <BREAK>
i had an explosion .PERIOD <BREAK>
the large majority of our children belong ,COMMA as i already mentioned ,COMMA to the most vulnerable strata of the venezuelan population .PERIOD <BREAK>
we think it's a matter of race .PERIOD and is this fair ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
i thought ,COMMA look at the impact that my research has had .PERIOD <BREAK>
are you going to compete ?QUESTIONMARK no .PERIOD no one's going to win this thing .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so ,COMMA since the best way to see how people go wrong is to actually do it yourself ,COMMA i'm going to give you guys a quick experiment to sort of watch your own financial intuitions in action .PERIOD <BREAK>
and we've also managed to communicate with people all over the world ,COMMA from extraordinary places .PERIOD <BREAK>
i have half a dozen ideas .PERIOD <BREAK>
so they'll put <NUM> or <NUM> up at a time ,COMMA and they just go up in the same way as a single-family dwelling would go up here in an area .PERIOD <BREAK>
because it's quite hard to waterproof buildings anyway ,COMMA but if you say you're going to drill <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> holes in it -- we had quite a time .PERIOD <BREAK>
to do this though ,COMMA we need to redesign education in a major way ,COMMA to balance depth with interdisciplinary communication ,COMMA and explicitly train people how to contribute to ,COMMA and benefit from other disciplines .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's a little bit like the fact that automobiles -- thousands of automobiles are stolen every day in the united states ;SEMICOLON not one single post office truck is stolen .PERIOD ok .PERIOD and why ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
go and study it .PERIOD <BREAK>
so be aware of the bear .PERIOD <BREAK>
i would say ,COMMA we should call ourselves coctivors -- from coquere ,COMMA to cook .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i try to live in beautiful places .PERIOD <BREAK>
and depending on how you create the pattern of lighting or not lighting ,COMMA the digital elements ,COMMA or ,COMMA for that matter ,COMMA the neurons in the sheet ,COMMA you're going to be able to construct a map .PERIOD <BREAK>

in fact ,COMMA most of us do everything we can to avoid thinking about being wrong ,COMMA or at least to avoid thinking about the possibility that we ourselves are wrong .PERIOD <BREAK>
why would we use that verb ,COMMA it doesn't feel right ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
we went up to them with our submersible .PERIOD <BREAK>

now some of you might actually right now be thinking ,COMMA it's downright crazy to have <NUM> tedtalks summarized into just six words .PERIOD <BREAK>
and mahmoud ,COMMA of course i can .PERIOD <BREAK>
and that meant that foreigners ,COMMA as it said in the treaty ,COMMA were allowed to trade freely in china .PERIOD <BREAK>
and in a lot of cultures they give knives -- like ,COMMA as soon as they're toddlers they have knives .PERIOD <BREAK>
it strip-mines carcasses ,COMMA and it has amazing teeth ,COMMA because it enables the hyena to essentially eat bones .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's happened almost entirely without big money behind it .PERIOD <BREAK>

they made some really great promises ,COMMA and actually have fulfilled a lot of them .PERIOD <BREAK>
these gorillas were murdered ,COMMA some would even say crucified ,COMMA and unsurprisingly ,COMMA they sparked international outrage .PERIOD <BREAK>

that's not insignificant .PERIOD <BREAK>

it was sold to proto-feminist housewives as a way to cut down on housework .PERIOD <BREAK>
now someday ,COMMA with a billion point three people getting richer ,COMMA they are going to be bigger than the united states .PERIOD <BREAK>

it has polar caps .PERIOD it has an atmosphere somewhat thinner than ours ,COMMA so it has weather .PERIOD so ,COMMA it's very similar to some extent ,COMMA and you can see some of the features on it ,COMMA like the grand canyon on mars ,COMMA or what we call the grand canyon on mars .PERIOD <BREAK>

they delegate education about infant feeding ,COMMA family planning ,COMMA safer sex ,COMMA actions that nurses simple just don't have time for .PERIOD <BREAK>

the black ,COMMA you can't really see this ,COMMA but these are norwegian basking shark hunting vessels ,COMMA and the black line in the crow's nest signifies this is a shark vessel rather than a whaling vessel .PERIOD <BREAK>
really not a very sensible thing to do .PERIOD <BREAK>
the answer to that question changes depending on who's sitting around that table .PERIOD <BREAK>

all it requires is to recognize among us ,COMMA every day -- the few of us that can see -- are surrounded by people like the ones i've told you .PERIOD <BREAK>

in this case ,COMMA people like me are acceptable .PERIOD <BREAK>
it may seem ridiculous ,COMMA but we have a really lousy history of anticipating things like this and actually being prepared for them .PERIOD <BREAK>
so here's a nankani village in mali .PERIOD <BREAK>
computers and the programming languages that we talk to them in ,COMMA that we teach them in ,COMMA are hideously insensate when it comes to space .PERIOD <BREAK>

and this man ,COMMA archie cochrane ,COMMA is a prisoner of war and a doctor ,COMMA and he has a problem .PERIOD <BREAK>
and both in the production of plastic ,COMMA the use of plastic and the disposal of plastic ,COMMA the people who have the bull's-eye on their foreheads are poor people .PERIOD <BREAK>
and when all of that data is held ,COMMA they can do almost whatever they want with it .PERIOD <BREAK>

how much energy and money does it take to actually have a plan to negotiate with an advanced species ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>

and then ,COMMA of course ,COMMA nasa also had a big announcement ,COMMA and president clinton gave a press conference ,COMMA about this amazing discovery of life in a martian meteorite .PERIOD <BREAK>
we do like to consume ,COMMA but every time one of these new tools came along ,COMMA it turned out we also like to produce and we like to share .PERIOD <BREAK>
government had no budget .PERIOD <BREAK>

because of the improved quality ,COMMA we could ask for higher prices .PERIOD <BREAK>
i call it the smart dust navy .PERIOD <BREAK>

the dry air is really good for telescopes ,COMMA and also ,COMMA the cloud cover is below the summit of these mountains so that the telescopes have about <NUM> days of clear skies .PERIOD <BREAK>

which means that it is irreducibly difficult to find out how it will really behave ,COMMA and whether it matches our physical universe .PERIOD <BREAK>
i'm also interested in working with unusual materials and common materials in unusual ways .PERIOD <BREAK>
it is a huge benefit .PERIOD <BREAK>
if you ever really want to get away from it all and see something that you have never seen ,COMMA and have an excellent chance of seeing something no one has ever seen ,COMMA get in a sub .PERIOD <BREAK>
he found himself in kenya on a fulbright and he had a very interesting insight ,COMMA which is that he said ,COMMA there must be entrepreneurs in kenya ;SEMICOLON there must be entrepreneurs everywhere .PERIOD <BREAK>
so low income here ,COMMA high income there .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so here is one that kind of goes -- i still just want to draw out on this issue .PERIOD <BREAK>
and an important language dependent skill is enabled by this training -- that is to say reading .PERIOD <BREAK>
let's go back and visit our equation .PERIOD <BREAK>
i wish that sexual abuse and exploitation in schools would stop .PERIOD <BREAK>

chris anderson :COLON oh ,COMMA ok .PERIOD <BREAK>

so we've talked about the static face and judging the static face ,COMMA but actually ,COMMA we're more comfortable with judging the moving face .PERIOD <BREAK>
so if a radiologist is looking at the scan of a patient with suspected pneumonia ,COMMA say ,COMMA what happens is that ,COMMA if they see evidence of pneumonia on the scan ,COMMA they literally stop looking at it -- thereby missing the tumor sitting three inches below on the patient's lungs .PERIOD <BREAK>

i mean this quite seriously .PERIOD <BREAK>
and most controversially ,COMMA it means the tar sands .PERIOD <BREAK>
my artistic horizons continue to grow .PERIOD <BREAK>

two months later ,COMMA six years old ,COMMA i'm able to do one ,COMMA two ,COMMA three ,COMMA four ,COMMA five ,COMMA six ,COMMA seven .PERIOD <BREAK>

love and peace were mentioned ,COMMA kind of with quote marks around them ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>

one of the simplest facts in business is something that we often neglect ,COMMA and that is that we're all human .PERIOD <BREAK>
the other side is planted like that by the men .PERIOD metaphorically ,COMMA you turn it on the side ,COMMA and you have a piece of cloth .PERIOD <BREAK>

that's science .PERIOD <BREAK>
the change in oxytocin predicted their feelings of empathy .PERIOD <BREAK>

because when we looked at the four platforms around the site ,COMMA one of which is an upgrade of the families' platform ,COMMA we knew that these had to be moveable to respond to changing conditions ,COMMA and the changing definition of what ground zero is .PERIOD <BREAK>
we're not doing films for the elite and the people in their glass houses .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so i ended up walking like this .PERIOD <BREAK>

they've been around a long time ,COMMA have been very important to coast communities .PERIOD <BREAK>

alright ?QUESTIONMARK intrinsic motivators versus extrinsic motivators .PERIOD <BREAK>

but overthrowing a government is one thing and building a stable democracy is a bit more complicated .PERIOD <BREAK>
isn't it weird that my <NUM> -year-old husband is forever losing his way home in the car ,COMMA from the driveway ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
so then ,COMMA just like the last chart ,COMMA look what happens .PERIOD <BREAK>

i will give points for those who know it .PERIOD <BREAK>

i think we must make our bosses accountable to their employees in any way we can .PERIOD <BREAK>

actually it sounded nice in the beginning ,COMMA but when you look at <NUM> summaries ,COMMA it's quite a lot .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's like someone who has a serious illness and pretends it's the flu and it will just go away .PERIOD <BREAK>

she is meant to have the power to look inside people and see the good and bad in everyone .PERIOD <BREAK>
the perverse at heart will seek out the ambiguities ,COMMA trying to create discord by pinning down meanings of their own .PERIOD <BREAK>

it doesn't matter much -- it says if you get <NUM> watts of electricity ,COMMA you'll get <NUM> or <NUM> watts of heat .PERIOD <BREAK>

but technology has its own agenda ,COMMA like anything ,COMMA like life itself .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i started to argue .PERIOD i said ,COMMA i'm not going to do that .PERIOD <BREAK>

you watch the video with superimposed graphics that indicate your depth and compass heading .PERIOD <BREAK>
that's what i say in my mind .PERIOD and i just say thank you ,COMMA and i go on to the next one .PERIOD <BREAK>
now light and temperature vary with each window's microclimate ,COMMA so a window farm requires a farmer ,COMMA and she must decide what kind of crops she is going to put in her window farm ,COMMA and whether she is going to feed her food organically .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i can tell you this happens ,COMMA because it happened to me .PERIOD <BREAK>
we all ,COMMA everybody ,COMMA has a story that they follow .PERIOD <BREAK>
and we intend to use those numbers to create demand pull ,COMMA and flip the market .PERIOD <BREAK>
but we use it because we're interested in the way that it can help us to express the emotions and behavioral patterns in these creatures that we create .PERIOD <BREAK>
we believe it is .PERIOD <BREAK>
maybe i'm getting a little too abstract ,COMMA but you know ,COMMA this is the sort of -- returning to our comic characters -- this is sort of the universe ,COMMA or a different universe view ,COMMA that i think is going to be very prevalent in the future -- from biotech to materials assembly .PERIOD it was great to hear bill joy .PERIOD <BREAK>
so we looked at a few more conflicts .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the reason is that tool use ,COMMA in the beginning -- for thousands and thousands of years ,COMMA everything has been a physical modification of self .PERIOD <BREAK>
you can really start to see the stories told by the hands here .PERIOD <BREAK>
for the koran always urges us to remember ,COMMA to remind each other ,COMMA because the knowledge of truth is within every human being .PERIOD <BREAK>
i said ,COMMA it's a prize from [an] art competition .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i said ,COMMA well ,COMMA you know ,COMMA that might be a bit ambitious for our budget .PERIOD <BREAK>
okay ,COMMA some of the movements of the plants are very well-known .PERIOD <BREAK>
she sang beautifully ,COMMA and she even managed to say a few words in chinese :COLON 送你葱 so it's not like hello or thank you ,COMMA that ordinary stuff .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's probably more powerful than marriage vows .PERIOD <BREAK>
well ,COMMA something like technorati is supplying that .PERIOD <BREAK>
costa rica -- average life expectancy is <NUM> -and-a-half years .PERIOD <BREAK>
and when you turn the switch off ,COMMA the light goes off .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i simply said ,COMMA i'm sorry .PERIOD <BREAK>
whereas u .PERIOD k .PERIOD and united states is getting richer and richer .PERIOD <BREAK>
these live in a global space which is largely unregulated ,COMMA not subject to the rule of law ,COMMA and in which people may act free of constraint .PERIOD <BREAK>
and they were telling me that google software has gotten so advanced that ,COMMA based on your interaction with google over your lifetime ,COMMA they can actually predict what you are going to say next .PERIOD <BREAK>
it wouldn't be such an inspiring scenography without this theater .PERIOD <BREAK>
six and a half days ,COMMA that certainly is a fatal dose .PERIOD <BREAK>
how can we cook that we have this language developed ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and as you go down ,COMMA the washing machine at the surface calms down .PERIOD <BREAK>
and we also sampled the outdoor air .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's an important strategic partner .PERIOD <BREAK>
it’s technology .PERIOD i’m very interested in it and i really think that the digital non-linear editing has slashed ,COMMA you know ,COMMA the cost now is a fraction of what it used to be .PERIOD <BREAK>
the way we transmit wireless data is by using electromagnetic waves -- in particular ,COMMA radio waves .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so i put my books away ,COMMA back in their suitcase ,COMMA and i put them under my bed ,COMMA and there they stayed for the rest of the summer .PERIOD <BREAK>
and if you look ,COMMA you'll see that there's only one way you can score three .PERIOD <BREAK>
and aristotle said often in dealing with other people ,COMMA we need to bend the rules .PERIOD <BREAK>
i ended up at this really fancy party .PERIOD <BREAK>
that's actually hy .PERIOD <BREAK>
they form songs ,COMMA and they appear to play a role in reproduction ,COMMA sort of like that of song birds .PERIOD <BREAK>
he has been charged ,COMMA about five days ago ,COMMA with obtaining <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> cables and releasing <NUM> .PERIOD <BREAK>
we're always looking for little ,COMMA good things that people do .PERIOD <BREAK>
if you want to know more ,COMMA just come have a look at our website .PERIOD thank you .PERIOD <BREAK>
of those ,COMMA only nuclear and hydro are green .PERIOD <BREAK>
yeah ,COMMA it's a good setup .PERIOD that's a big setup .PERIOD <BREAK>
but it's this process of trial and error that explains this great divergence ,COMMA this incredible performance of western economies .PERIOD <BREAK>
from the simplest version in nature ,COMMA one branch ,COMMA my engineering collaborator ,COMMA ron fearing ,COMMA at berkeley ,COMMA had made the first synthetic version .PERIOD <BREAK>
and they look something like this .PERIOD <BREAK>
here's a way of transporting water .PERIOD <BREAK>
oh beloved dentist :COLON your rubber fingers in my mouth .PERIOD <BREAK>
and ,COMMA at the end ,COMMA although it may rise ,COMMA it will just cross the mind ,COMMA like a bird crossing the sky without leaving any track .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so there's nothing in the software that enforces the rules .PERIOD <BREAK>
there was a huge amount of crime .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA i blew it up and ran into the living room ,COMMA my finger where it shouldn't have been ,COMMA i was waving this buzzing sheep around ,COMMA and my mother looked like she was going to die of shock .PERIOD <BREAK>
that's the kind of engagement you want to have happen .PERIOD <BREAK>
and those are the dry land species .PERIOD <BREAK>
we'll pick it up .PERIOD we'll make sure it's stored properly .PERIOD -- their yields have gone up two- ,COMMA three- ,COMMA fourfold and they figure it out ,COMMA because it's the first guaranteed opportunity they've had in their life .PERIOD <BREAK>
stage one is literally the culture of gangs and it is the culture of prisons .PERIOD <BREAK>
she lives in a little worker's camp right next to the road ,COMMA and she wanted a different lot on things .PERIOD <BREAK>
that's close to being a kind of built-in intuition .PERIOD <BREAK>
even though i present confident ,COMMA i was scared .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i think we'll meet in the middle some place ,COMMA and have the classic thing that you have ,COMMA which is a publishing system and a library system working in parallel .PERIOD <BREAK>
now ,COMMA i want to tell a story ,COMMA which is a very famous story in the indian and buddhist tradition ,COMMA of the great saint asanga who was a contemporary of augustine in the west and was sort of like the buddhist augustine .PERIOD <BREAK>
we don't know what the sequence is ;SEMICOLON just pull them out of the field .PERIOD <BREAK>
and we know that most of it is currently owned by people we might call westerners :COLON europeans ,COMMA north americans ,COMMA australasians .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA i saw many trains and also rode on one .PERIOD <BREAK>
i've been a geek forever and i wrote the very first dos .PERIOD <BREAK>
i know many well-intentioned non-muslims who've begun reading the koran ,COMMA but given up ,COMMA disconcerted by its otherness .PERIOD <BREAK>
this was the notion of whether the patients felt that they actually would go ahead and brush and floss their teeth .PERIOD <BREAK>
but i would like to talk further about the combination of light and darkness as a quality in our life .PERIOD <BREAK>
obviously ,COMMA you see the resemblance .PERIOD <BREAK>
he killed <NUM> .PERIOD <BREAK>
my father's a little different .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's like ,COMMA are science and plumbing compatible ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and in interactions with people ,COMMA almost all the time ,COMMA it is this kind of flexibility that is required .PERIOD <BREAK>
if you look at declassified cables ,COMMA that's the sort of material that's there .PERIOD <BREAK>
♫ we are <NUM> billion light-years from the edge ♫ ♫ that's a guess ♫ ♫ no one can ever say it's true ♫ ♫ but i know that i will always be with you ♫ well ,COMMA that's nice .PERIOD <BREAK>
parents pool their money to hire some local teachers to a private ,COMMA tiny ,COMMA unofficial school .PERIOD <BREAK>
and somebody brought a boyfriend ,COMMA somebody a father .PERIOD <BREAK>
while universities are trying to devise courses in conflict resolution ,COMMA and governments are trying to stop skirmishes at borders ,COMMA we are surrounded by violence ,COMMA whether it's road rage ,COMMA or whether it's domestic violence ,COMMA whether it's a teacher beating up a student and killing her because she hasn't done her homework ,COMMA it's everywhere .PERIOD <BREAK>
and then a bbc crew came cruising through the biology department ,COMMA looking for a story to do about new technologies in biology .PERIOD <BREAK>
people envision this as being very difficult .PERIOD <BREAK>
and there was something very moving about all of this human expression being shot off into the night sky .PERIOD <BREAK>
and we can leave the patient whole and intact and functional afterwards .PERIOD <BREAK>
he's got a small residual limb on one side .PERIOD <BREAK>
and we even know something about the way the brain does this .PERIOD <BREAK>
armstrong o'brian ,COMMA jr .PERIOD shared it with three other men .PERIOD <BREAK>
so what i was trying to do is think of a way that we could study suspended animation to think about a way to reproduce ,COMMA maybe ,COMMA what happened to the skier .PERIOD <BREAK>
four feet .PERIOD nothing larger than the sum of her figurative parts .PERIOD <BREAK>
who would do that ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
now what you can see is we've sampled the area in the north atlantic ,COMMA in the north sea in particular ,COMMA and also the east coast of north america fairly well .PERIOD <BREAK>
okay ,COMMA here's another question :COLON do you think of yourself as spiritual in any way ,COMMA shape or form ?QUESTIONMARK raise your hand .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's a bit different from the others .PERIOD <BREAK>
as the work on paradigms ,COMMA long time ago showed -- thomas kuhn's work -- it's in the intersection of ideas that new developments -- true breakthroughs -- occur .PERIOD <BREAK>
this something else is this dancing filament of energy .PERIOD <BREAK>
next one ,COMMA please .PERIOD he's broken my pattern ,COMMA that son-of-a-bitch .PERIOD <BREAK>
you sort of leap up very quickly in your youth .PERIOD <BREAK>
they spring from the same source .PERIOD <BREAK>
it is why i look to art .PERIOD <BREAK>
we filed the patent for her ,COMMA the national innovation foundation .PERIOD <BREAK>
it knows when to stop growing because it can count .PERIOD <BREAK>
this makes university administrators very nervous ,COMMA because girls don't want to go to schools that don't have boys .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i'm glad i'm a bee man and not a bat man ,COMMA because there's no money to research the bat problems .PERIOD <BREAK>
you formulate a recipe based upon the factors you can control ,COMMA whether it be the skills or the fertilizer or the plant choice .PERIOD <BREAK>
when most people think about the beginnings of aids ,COMMA they're gonna think back to the <NUM> s .PERIOD <BREAK>
so we actually got some funding from the world bank to try it out .PERIOD <BREAK>
face <NUM> face demonstrated that what we thought impossible was possible -- and ,COMMA you know what ,COMMA even easy .PERIOD <BREAK>
that is to say ,COMMA they specialize with respect to reproduction .PERIOD <BREAK>
there was an underground railroad of sorts that was going on during those years .PERIOD maybe some of you remember it .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the following year they sent me this one ,COMMA which i thought was kind of funny .PERIOD <BREAK>
because ,COMMA if that hypothesis were to be true ,COMMA it would have massive repercussions in our understanding of what's causing the many different aspects of the autism phenotype .PERIOD <BREAK>
here in the netherlands ,COMMA i think it's more than <NUM> percent .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is a brain from a lamprey eel .PERIOD <BREAK>
how long did it take to go from one system to the next ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
so if they wanted the world to end ,COMMA if they wanted productivity to stop ,COMMA they could make this a <NUM> -minute cycle ,COMMA and no one could do anything else ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
but if you stack it up ,COMMA you just see this amazing ,COMMA staggering amount of dollars that have been put into the system to fund and bail us out .PERIOD <BREAK>
and ,COMMA in a way ,COMMA that's exactly how packets move around the internet ,COMMA sometimes in as many as <NUM> or <NUM> hops ,COMMA with the intervening entities that are passing the data around having no particular contractual or legal obligation to the original sender or to the receiver .PERIOD <BREAK>
the one percent will own even more than <NUM> percent of all the world's goods and services .PERIOD not because they've grown richer ,COMMA but because the rest of the world has grown increasingly poorer .PERIOD <BREAK>
and when i close it ,COMMA it becomes a character .PERIOD <BREAK>
i hope you enjoyed mathemagics .PERIOD thank you .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's just a sign of things to come .PERIOD <BREAK>
and then ,COMMA finally talk a little bit about a third way ,COMMA about another technology ,COMMA which is probably better than anything we have ,COMMA but which -- there hasn't been any enthusiasm for adoption precisely because people are so enamored with the current car seat solution .PERIOD ok .PERIOD <BREAK>
yeah .PERIOD his initials are js ,COMMA and he owns rockefeller center ,COMMA if that helps anyone -- volunteered to help .PERIOD <BREAK>
all the stereotypes that the regime was trying to put on us through their so-called propaganda ,COMMA or mainstream media ,COMMA are proven wrong .PERIOD <BREAK>
just give me your company logo .PERIOD <BREAK>
we would have a green society that dr .PERIOD king would be proud of .PERIOD <BREAK>
because we are the environment ,COMMA and how we treat each other is really how we’re going to treat the environment .PERIOD <BREAK>
here's a passage -- it's very much what he said ,COMMA anyway .PERIOD <BREAK>
of course ,COMMA human groups are nowhere near as cohesive as beehives .PERIOD <BREAK>
this animal's fossils are only found in this area of south america -- a nice clean band here -- and this part of africa .PERIOD <BREAK>
actually ,COMMA i think the first person you'll see is the young engineer who was put in charge of this project .PERIOD okay .PERIOD <BREAK>
is that a literal part of the image ,COMMA or is my eye making that interference pattern -- is my eye completing that interference pattern ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
thank you .PERIOD <BREAK>
you find them in any inaccessible village around the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
the bellwether for whether our family was broke or not was breakfast .PERIOD <BREAK>
we have collected and conserved a great deal of biological diversity ,COMMA agricultural diversity ,COMMA mostly in the form of seed ,COMMA and we put it in seed banks ,COMMA which is a fancy way of saying a freezer .PERIOD <BREAK>
we need to move mexican society ,COMMA the members of society who are at this level ,COMMA to the next level ,COMMA which is action .PERIOD <BREAK>
most of them should be in orbit around something .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is even more amazing .PERIOD put this in your speed dial .PERIOD <BREAK>
does the color of the valve matter ?QUESTIONMARK what matters here ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
so the surgeon can see inside the patient ,COMMA through their lens ,COMMA where the tumor is ,COMMA where the blood vessels are .PERIOD <BREAK>
so they snapped into action .PERIOD <BREAK>
and moreover ,COMMA it profoundly changes your perceptions by what you do .PERIOD <BREAK>
but there are still over <NUM> million indians ,COMMA pakistanis ,COMMA sri lankans ,COMMA bangladeshis ,COMMA nepalese ,COMMA who remain washed up on the shores of poverty .PERIOD <BREAK>
here's the first example .PERIOD <BREAK>
i created a video which was based on a wireside chat that i'd given ,COMMA and i uploaded it to youtube .PERIOD <BREAK>
i had more than <NUM> surgeries .PERIOD <BREAK>
now if i want to talk about the defense of my country ,COMMA i have to speak to the minister of health because pandemic disease is a threat to my security ,COMMA i have to speak to the minister of agriculture because food security is a threat to my security ,COMMA i have to speak to the minister of industry because the fragility of our hi-tech infrastructure is now a point of attack for our enemies -- as we see from cyber warfare -- i have to speak to the minister of home affairs because who has entered my country ,COMMA who lives in that terraced house in that inner city has a direct effect on what happens in my country -- as we in london saw in the <NUM> / <NUM> bombings .PERIOD <BREAK>
doesn't matter if it rains a little ,COMMA you have a windshield wiper .PERIOD <BREAK>
math ,COMMA differential equations .PERIOD <BREAK>
they debated ,COMMA should it have one s or two ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
i'd much rather know whether you like buffy the vampire slayer rather than how old you are .PERIOD <BREAK>
i think it was that interaction that led to personal computing .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's a seductor ,COMMA but i just feel in my bones that that's possible .PERIOD <BREAK>
i mean ,COMMA you'd think this is the result of some tabletop experiment ,COMMA but this is the result of worldwide chaotic behavior -- countries accusing each other of dumping products ,COMMA ipos ,COMMA bankruptcies ,COMMA marketing programs .PERIOD <BREAK>
the whole system would have a much lower profile ,COMMA but also we could gather sunlight for six and a half to seven hours a day .PERIOD <BREAK>
sun ?QUESTIONMARK no .PERIOD well is there another name for a sunrise ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
you can see the little pink cursor moving along ,COMMA representing our position .PERIOD <BREAK>
he also received a visit from the leader of the black community ,COMMA a minister ,COMMA who said ,COMMA mr .PERIOD teszler ,COMMA i sure hope you're going to hire some black workers for this new plant of yours .PERIOD <BREAK>
the variation is very ,COMMA very small .PERIOD <BREAK>
and we don't understand why they won't let us in .PERIOD right ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
but carl norden is really the one who cracks the code .PERIOD <BREAK>
multiple flips ,COMMA a little more time .PERIOD <BREAK>
we can design better games .PERIOD <BREAK>
there's also aciniform silk ,COMMA which is used to wrap prey .PERIOD <BREAK>
but then ,COMMA in the second year of caltech ,COMMA they started grading .PERIOD <BREAK>
the saddest thing about all of this is that it's really hard to remember this .PERIOD <BREAK>
i learned about these things from studying shame .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's two fifth grade classes and two seventh grade classes .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's addition modulo <NUM> ,COMMA just like in the parity bit check on your computer .PERIOD <BREAK>
and we park .PERIOD and we stay .PERIOD <BREAK>
and if we cannot demonstrate to these groups that if you move towards democracy ,COMMA if you move towards taking part in civilized and normal standards among states ,COMMA there are some rewards on the other side .PERIOD <BREAK>
this may ,COMMA we're going to go from minus <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> meters in zacaton ,COMMA and if we're very lucky ,COMMA depthx will bring back the first robotically-discovered division of bacteria .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it's a bleak future for them .PERIOD <BREAK>
attempts to put my poems to music have had disastrous results ,COMMA in all cases .PERIOD <BREAK>
but eventually ,COMMA every dog has its day ,COMMA and she ended up in traffic court ,COMMA where she bartered with the judge for a discount .PERIOD <BREAK>
for one thing ,COMMA he possessed an uncanny ability to empathize with and to think about other peoples' point of view .PERIOD <BREAK>
do you hear it ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
it turns out that -- you see this sign on almost every commercial vessel in the united states -- you know ,COMMA if you spilled a couple of gallons of oil ,COMMA you would be in big trouble .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA it's been a long route to get here :COLON <NUM> years from the beginning .PERIOD <BREAK>
and decatur ,COMMA georgia's a small southern town .PERIOD <BREAK>
and those three verses are the core of authenticity .PERIOD <BREAK>
here's another violent case .PERIOD this really didn't kill the person .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's just elementary probability theory .PERIOD <BREAK>
we have to have more theory ,COMMA and it can come as much from the top down .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so ,COMMA what i've done is ,COMMA i started getting interested in creating online social spaces to share that feeling with people who don't consider themselves artists .PERIOD <BREAK>
thank god i announced the locations and everything .PERIOD <BREAK>
yes .PERIOD <BREAK>
walk the dog .PERIOD have sex again .PERIOD <BREAK>
your consciousness ,COMMA the you-ness of you ,COMMA the me-ness of me -- that gets this one go .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's a thousand times more conductive than copper .PERIOD <BREAK>
you've got to work with the building department .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i want to get one of these .PERIOD <BREAK>
all those tumors have heavy bleeding during periods ,COMMA abdominal pressure ,COMMA back pain ,COMMA frequent urination .PERIOD <BREAK>
it all of a sudden dawned on me ,COMMA in this project ,COMMA that the purpose of these rides should actually be to expose the kids to one thing only :COLON love .PERIOD <BREAK>
and we talked about ,COMMA as a class ,COMMA the fact that number one ,COMMA the confessions might not be reliable ,COMMA but number two ,COMMA we did not want to encourage the police to keep doing this ,COMMA especially as it was now against the law .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's really rare that you don't have trade-offs between health and economics ,COMMA or environment and economics .PERIOD <BREAK>
the first of those is that design is human-centered .PERIOD <BREAK>
so our dna has the capacity to do these kinds of wound-healing mechanisms .PERIOD <BREAK>
i heard an <NUM> -year-old woman whose legs were broken and pulled out of her sockets and twisted up on her head as the soldiers raped her like that .PERIOD <BREAK>
these are companies that didn't exist five years ago .PERIOD <BREAK>
and here we are .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is a hydras's arm .PERIOD <BREAK>
it never works .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the reason he went is because he had a fear of his body image ,COMMA and he wanted to explore what was underlying that .PERIOD <BREAK>
and he said ,COMMA well for one thing ,COMMA there are more girls there .PERIOD <BREAK>
so you want to license this software to publishers to make books as beautiful as that ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
it's a non-sugar-coated history of sugar .PERIOD <BREAK>
also ,COMMA a number of the topics that we've been talking about this week at ted are things that we've addressed in the past on worldchanging :COLON cradle-to-cradle design ,COMMA mit's fab labs ,COMMA the consequences of extreme longevity ,COMMA the one laptop per child project ,COMMA even gapminder .PERIOD <BREAK>
it killed almost everything that was left .PERIOD <BREAK>
there's four family members that come in every day .PERIOD <BREAK>
it forms a surface that is ,COMMA say ,COMMA chemically active .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i very quickly made a list of the things i was interested in ,COMMA put them in a hierarchy ,COMMA divided them into chunks of time and then made a plan ,COMMA very much like in grade school .PERIOD <BREAK>
but there are two things at heart that i think drive a conservative philosophy that are really relevant to this whole debate .PERIOD <BREAK>
so if that's your responsibility ,COMMA how are you going to do that ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
it makes no odds .PERIOD in fact ,COMMA in the northern hemisphere ,COMMA we're further from the sun in summer ,COMMA as it happens ,COMMA but it makes no odds ,COMMA the difference .PERIOD <BREAK>
but that's a wrong problem to ask .PERIOD <BREAK>
does an election produce an accountable and legitimate government ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and again ,COMMA i couldn't go .PERIOD but it's a fascinating group .PERIOD they make balloon animals .PERIOD <BREAK>
helicopter stunts are always fun ,COMMA hanging out of them ,COMMA whatever .PERIOD <BREAK>
and in the summer of <NUM> ,COMMA we invited dozens of blind youth from all over the country and gave them a chance to take it for a spin .PERIOD <BREAK>
and we've decided that we should think about this not so much in terms of cost ,COMMA but in terms of simplicity .PERIOD <BREAK>
you get your mtdna from your mother ,COMMA and your mother's mother ,COMMA all the way back to the very first woman .PERIOD <BREAK>
and that's by actually cutting into their bones .PERIOD <BREAK>
that's the idea .PERIOD <BREAK>
you know ,COMMA this little office of the conductor .PERIOD <BREAK>
we have one of these things now .PERIOD it's completely cool .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the third big change is that members of the former audience ,COMMA as dan gilmore calls them ,COMMA can now also be producers and not consumers .PERIOD <BREAK>
the truth of the matter is otherwise .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so cooperation quickly decays from reasonably good ,COMMA down to close to zero .PERIOD <BREAK>
what it is ,COMMA is a picture of the spectrum of hydrogen .PERIOD <BREAK>
and then i started another company .PERIOD <BREAK>
and in bulgaria ,COMMA the mafia was soon joined with <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> people who were sacked from their jobs in the security services between <NUM> and <NUM> .PERIOD <BREAK>
he finally stops the runaway stage .PERIOD <BREAK>
and ,COMMA i think ,COMMA we're only there if we can have something like ballet dancing .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the animal comes back for a food reward .PERIOD <BREAK>
and when you land ,COMMA you'll be able to go back into this giant eye .PERIOD <BREAK>
and that's a little found object .PERIOD <BREAK>
here's some faces on the side of a rock .PERIOD <BREAK>
the lifesaver bottle works really simply .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the high school students who were learning to blog through foko club suddenly found themselves talking to an international audience about the demonstrations ,COMMA the violence ,COMMA everything that was going on within this country .PERIOD <BREAK>
if ,COMMA for example ,COMMA you seek to do a building which goes right to the edge of the pavement ,COMMA it's the same amount of space .PERIOD <BREAK>
and in fact ,COMMA online dictionaries replicate almost all the problems of print ,COMMA except for searchability .PERIOD <BREAK>
we actually get a chance to choose not to use products that have dangerous ,COMMA poisonous plastic in them .PERIOD <BREAK>
it would skip a beat .PERIOD <BREAK>
no .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's going to be the department of agriculture for the <NUM> st century .PERIOD <BREAK>
in fact we do this in individuals of any age ,COMMA in these different species -- that is to say from infancies ,COMMA infancy up to adulthood and old age .PERIOD <BREAK>
and you made these pincushions out of wooden clothespins -- when we used to hang clothes on clotheslines outside .PERIOD <BREAK>
there were a lot of programs in architecture and design that were about pointing people in the direction of a better design for a better life .PERIOD <BREAK>
see this man box has in it all the ingredients of how we define what it means to be a man .PERIOD <BREAK>
and this is where you come in .PERIOD <BREAK>
the idea behind her work was that at that time ,COMMA everybody was saying you have to really divide your life .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA the average age of a person in second life is <NUM> ,COMMA however ,COMMA the use of second life increases dramatically as your physical age increases .PERIOD so as you go from age <NUM> to age <NUM> -- and there are many people in their sixties using second life -- this is also not a sharp curve -- it's very ,COMMA very distributed -- usage goes up in terms of ,COMMA like ,COMMA hours per week by <NUM> percent as you go from age <NUM> to age <NUM> in real life ,COMMA so there's not -- many people make the mistake of believing that second life is some kind of an online game .PERIOD actually it's generally unappealing -- i'm just speaking broadly and critically -- it's not very appealing to people that play online video games ,COMMA because the graphics are not yet equivalent to -- i mean ,COMMA these are very nice pictures ,COMMA but in general the graphics are not quite equivalent to the fine-tuned graphics that you see in a grand theft auto <NUM> .PERIOD <BREAK>
i'd like to introduce you to one of our first robots ,COMMA data .PERIOD <BREAK>
how did i get dragged deeper and deeper into an attempt to communicate ,COMMA giving talks in <NUM> countries ,COMMA getting arrested ,COMMA burning up the vacation time that i had accumulated over <NUM> years ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
so there ,COMMA we experience the translation .PERIOD now we'll experience the interpretation .PERIOD <BREAK>
ethanol -- new ways of making ethanol .PERIOD <BREAK>
that might be true ,COMMA but it's not terribly relevant .PERIOD <BREAK>
i know that one day my children will be wondering -- or my grandchildren ,COMMA or my great-grandchildren ,COMMA if i ever have children -- what i am going to -- who i was ,COMMA so i do something that's very narcissistic :COLON i am a blogger -- that is an amazing thing for me ,COMMA because it captures a moment in time everyday .PERIOD <BREAK>
so i asked natalie ,COMMA what do i do ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
yet ,COMMA that's the one step computers can do better than any human after years of practice .PERIOD <BREAK>
adventists also tend to hang out with other adventists .PERIOD <BREAK>
this boy is called zenola .PERIOD <BREAK>
and there is a long pause .PERIOD <BREAK>
and my introduction to business was in these $ <NUM> little infuses of capital .PERIOD <BREAK>
so we started .PERIOD <BREAK>
and then when the air comes back after it's been cooled it picks up that heat again .PERIOD <BREAK>
don't tell anybody we can actually steal from each other's designs .PERIOD <BREAK>
or it could take a fly and put legs where its antennae should be .PERIOD <BREAK>
the reason why -- despite all the efforts to cut it down ,COMMA to constrain it ,COMMA to hold it back -- why these open models will still start emerging with tremendous force ,COMMA is that they multiply our productive resources .PERIOD <BREAK>
so there was no job ,COMMA no food .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is not a story of a nameless someone who lived in some war ,COMMA who we do not know their hopes ,COMMA their dreams ,COMMA their accomplishments ,COMMA their families ,COMMA their beliefs ,COMMA their values .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i was part of this team -- this thinking ,COMMA learning team whose job it was to design and implement new software that created value in the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
and we studied with a wise man ,COMMA a guru named karoli baba ,COMMA who then told me to get rid of the dress ,COMMA put on a three-piece suit ,COMMA go join the united nations as a diplomat and work for the world health organization .PERIOD <BREAK>
he needed to change his prostheses -- a new pair of prostheses .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i was having fun with it .PERIOD <BREAK>
and then he added something i will never forget for the rest of my life .PERIOD <BREAK>
over dinner ,COMMA i asked him an impertinent question .PERIOD <BREAK>
this change in behavior allowed us to survive these worsening conditions in africa ,COMMA and they allowed us to start to expand around the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i wanted to close this program with a story of hope ,COMMA a story i did on marine reserves as sort of a solution to the problem of overfishing ,COMMA the global fish crisis story .PERIOD <BREAK>
you might say that the theme is nature and everything that follows is a variation on the subject .PERIOD <BREAK>
but we can do something too .PERIOD <BREAK>
a real airplane that we could finally present .PERIOD <BREAK>
but that lag is exactly what is expected .PERIOD <BREAK>
we can't make a bridge with squares because the train would come ,COMMA it would start doing a jig .PERIOD <BREAK>
in the meantime ,COMMA we had to cover nollywood ,COMMA and we talked to a lot of filmmakers .PERIOD <BREAK>
when their kids were five and two ,COMMA carol had a stroke and a brain tumor and died suddenly .PERIOD <BREAK>
so there's these two dinosaurs ,COMMA t .PERIOD rex and nanotyrannus .PERIOD <BREAK>
in order to do that ,COMMA we have to put you as a user back in the driver's seat .PERIOD <BREAK>
and we don't even need to confine ourselves to this macro vision .PERIOD <BREAK>
no one said ,COMMA get him a coach in speaking .PERIOD <BREAK>
it really changed my life totally .PERIOD <BREAK>

this one ,COMMA of course ,COMMA still works with the wild dogs .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the most important thing you can do ,COMMA i think ,COMMA is to use your personal power and your rolodex to lead your business ,COMMA your institution ,COMMA in going green .PERIOD <BREAK>
and when we act like it is ,COMMA and we stop entertaining the possibility that we could be wrong ,COMMA well that's when we end up doing things like dumping <NUM> million gallons of oil into the gulf of mexico ,COMMA or torpedoing the global economy .PERIOD <BREAK>
most of these are candidates .PERIOD <BREAK>
and if it looks a lot like a buick hubcap ,COMMA it's because it is .PERIOD <BREAK>
i didn't know who she was ,COMMA and she said ,COMMA did you get george abbott to talk ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
why do you get out of bed in the morning ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
or we can monitor doctors prescribing behaviors ,COMMA passively ,COMMA and see how the diffusion of innovation with pharmaceuticals occurs within [networks of] doctors .PERIOD <BREAK>
i was still in deep grief ;SEMICOLON i knew i didn't have the strength .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA at this point ,COMMA i do want to tell you that some of the major challenges we have .PERIOD <BREAK>
it requires that everyone treat choice as a private and self-defining act .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's progress ,COMMA that's the thing .PERIOD <BREAK>
i started my journey in california with a uc berkley <NUM> -year longitudinal study that examined the photos of students in an old yearbook and tried to measure their success and well-being throughout their life .PERIOD <BREAK>
so he took a walk down the hall to where they threw all those machines that had just crapped out on them -- i think that's the scientific term -- and he just started tinkering .PERIOD <BREAK>
it covers over <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> species .PERIOD <BREAK>
may you find a mud puddle to jump in someplace ,COMMA or find a way to get over ,COMMA around ,COMMA or through any wall that stands between you and one of your dreams .PERIOD <BREAK>
the foreboding sheen of an extra-large date .PERIOD <BREAK>
most of the population growth of the next <NUM> years will be in cities .PERIOD <BREAK>
so the idea there was that one must be able to -- how do you say ?QUESTIONMARK -- model price variation .PERIOD <BREAK>
in gateshead ,COMMA i took <NUM> children and i started to fine-tune the method .PERIOD <BREAK>
okay ,COMMA so i just want to take a sentence or two to say something about the encoder and what it's doing ,COMMA because it's really the key part and it's sort of interesting and kind of cool .PERIOD <BREAK>
and he brings the watch center ,COMMA into the robot's field of vision ,COMMA points to it ,COMMA gives it a motion cue ,COMMA and the robot looks at the watch quite successfully .PERIOD <BREAK>
uh huh .PERIOD <BREAK>
what should people here at ted ,COMMA here in the west ,COMMA do if they want to connect or make a difference and they believe in what's happening here ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
but to a first approximation ,COMMA the size of this machine is the size -- and its complexity ,COMMA kind of -- to your brain .PERIOD <BREAK>
in fact ,COMMA we have such amazing lifeforms that we can manipulate .PERIOD <BREAK>
and there were <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> people that contributed to the project ,COMMA or were unique ip addresses -- so about how many people contributed .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's a james joyce quote .PERIOD <BREAK>
that's as close as i can come to summing that up .PERIOD <BREAK>
we can zip through them as a possibility .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA disaster hits home .PERIOD <BREAK>
in japan ,COMMA for instance ,COMMA which i think is the third largest market ,COMMA they have a design law ;SEMICOLON it protects apparel ,COMMA but the novelty standard is so high ,COMMA you have to prove that your garment has never existed before ,COMMA it's totally unique .PERIOD <BREAK>
those who live beyond the cellphone ,COMMA those who have yet to see a computer ,COMMA those who have no electricity at home .PERIOD <BREAK>
with the same method ,COMMA we can also get him to circle a person .PERIOD <BREAK>
but that's what the math says .PERIOD <BREAK>
and all i could think of was ,COMMA if that happened to ran after three minutes ,COMMA and i can't feel my hands after five minutes ,COMMA what on earth is going to happen if i try <NUM> minutes ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
so we feel that we have a winning value proposition to transform farmers' choices ,COMMA to grow our agriculture ,COMMA and to change africa .PERIOD <BREAK>
or you start fishing .PERIOD <BREAK>
the oil price goes through the floor .PERIOD that company goes out of business ,COMMA and then you can bring the oil price back up .PERIOD <BREAK>
but now we have a compressed nitrogen cannon .PERIOD <BREAK>
like hunger and thirst ,COMMA it's almost impossible to stamp out .PERIOD <BREAK>
because after all ,COMMA if you ask even grownups about statistics ,COMMA they look extremely stupid .PERIOD <BREAK>
i was shocked .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the fishermen would tie a net off the headland ,COMMA string it out along the other net .PERIOD <BREAK>
ralph waldo emerson called him a man who does not offend by superiority .PERIOD <BREAK>
so this project started from the following realization :COLON it turns out that approximately <NUM> million captchas are typed everyday by people around the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
the writer said it's about history ,COMMA plot .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA i've spent a lot of my career working on ways to correct for the atmosphere ,COMMA to give us a cleaner view .PERIOD <BREAK>
so for example ,COMMA we're born loving the taste of something sweet and reacting aversively to the taste of something bitter .PERIOD <BREAK>
here is a letter of friendly advice .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA i hid in a time dimension .PERIOD <BREAK>
there's a poem by jack gilbert called the forgotten dialect of the heart .PERIOD <BREAK>
they've taken to just firing into the prison camp at random for fun .PERIOD <BREAK>
so that's an asset because if you've got to deal with the crash protection issues of the automobile ,COMMA forget it -- you're never going to fly it .PERIOD <BREAK>
i suspect a lot of people here have the same question i have .PERIOD <BREAK>
we'll loop around here in just a second ,COMMA and you'll see another one .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is the retiree health care benefits .PERIOD <BREAK>
she's changed the rules .PERIOD <BREAK>
i've got to produce the result now .PERIOD <BREAK>
so i'm telling you something you already knew :COLON namely ,COMMA that comparison changes the value of things .PERIOD <BREAK>
well wadah ,COMMA a group of members of the ted community ,COMMA tedxcairo ,COMMA are meeting as we speak .PERIOD <BREAK>
incredible ,COMMA you say ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
you know ,COMMA five fatal wrecks in the last <NUM> years ,COMMA the tail either came off or steering stuff inside the tail broke in some way .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so i was surprised when i noticed one day that the conservatives had disappeared from my facebook feed .PERIOD <BREAK>
they understand what accountability and democracy is .PERIOD <BREAK>
now ,COMMA you may say ,COMMA well ,COMMA that's obvious enough .PERIOD <BREAK>
and that changes the equation slightly ,COMMA doesn't it ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
you know ,COMMA we're pumping out lots of co <NUM> into the atmosphere ,COMMA from fossil fuels ,COMMA from cement production .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the great beauty is that you can then go from memory ,COMMA out of those association cortices ,COMMA and produce back images in the very same regions that have perception .PERIOD <BREAK>
patient :COLON a square and a circle .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's a really lucky demographic to work with .PERIOD <BREAK>
okay ?QUESTIONMARK i'm a lawyer ;SEMICOLON i don't believe in feelings .PERIOD <BREAK>
most people think that i was an actress .PERIOD i was never an actress .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i still do get to keep in touch with my mother and father ,COMMA albeit infrequently .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it caused me to wonder specifically ,COMMA if we could make new constellations today ,COMMA what would those look like ?QUESTIONMARK what would those be ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
i think it's excessive internet use in general ,COMMA excessive video gaming ,COMMA excessive new access to pornography .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the forces of convergence exploded .PERIOD <BREAK>
l'il c :COLON i tell them to create a ball ,COMMA and then you just use that ball of energy .PERIOD <BREAK>
on the high wire ,COMMA within months ,COMMA i'm able to master all the tricks they do in the circus ,COMMA except i am not satisfied .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the big question ,COMMA of course ,COMMA is why ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
there it is .PERIOD <BREAK>
dawn ,COMMA very good .PERIOD <BREAK>
because if you do ,COMMA then you end up acting like a crazy person ,COMMA and stoning adulterers ,COMMA or -- here's another example .PERIOD <BREAK>
and once that happened ,COMMA they were out in the city convincing everybody that child labor just had to be abolished .PERIOD <BREAK>
or perhaps he was just a yogi who was sitting on a rock ,COMMA staring at the sky and the sun and the moon .PERIOD <BREAK>
good .PERIOD <BREAK>
so i took the approach that the chair should do as much for them as humanly possible or as mechanistically possible so that they didn't have to fuss with it .PERIOD <BREAK>
so we're driving home and she's looking out the window ,COMMA and she goes ,COMMA mom .PERIOD what if two just people saw each other on the street ,COMMA like a man and a woman ,COMMA they just started doing it .PERIOD would that ever happen ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
so what you're basically seeing here is all bits and pieces and all this information .PERIOD <BREAK>
we spend most of our money on the last <NUM> percent of life .PERIOD <BREAK>
so in a traditional model ,COMMA most of the teacher's time is spent doing lectures and grading and whatnot .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i thought ,COMMA my god ,COMMA wouldn't that be something ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and i always thought it was such a fantastic device .PERIOD <BREAK>
if we can actually do it ,COMMA it must be possible .PERIOD <BREAK>
maybe i can come back next year ,COMMA or something like that .PERIOD <BREAK>
and we do all this -- and to go back to the original question ,COMMA what do people carry ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and then the students would come into our sound studios ,COMMA they would make their own rap songs with their own beats .PERIOD <BREAK>
country <NUM> has a systematic advantage over country <NUM> in infrastructures .PERIOD <BREAK>
the number across the u .PERIOD s .PERIOD and western europe is eight percent .PERIOD <BREAK>
that's not the way to solve problems .PERIOD <BREAK>
at that time ,COMMA there was only one bank that had atms in kenya ,COMMA and we could not get cash .PERIOD the family couldn't get cash for him to start the treatment until monday .PERIOD <BREAK>
and unlike all of the other animals ,COMMA we are obsessed with trying to figure it out .PERIOD <BREAK>
that's something on the order of <NUM> .PERIOD <NUM> billion u .PERIOD s .PERIOD dollars on translation costs alone .PERIOD <BREAK>
thank you .PERIOD <BREAK>
so my idea was that ,COMMA instead of sitting down and reaching for a lot of controls ,COMMA that you would sit on the chair ,COMMA and it would automatically balance your weight against the force required to recline .PERIOD <BREAK>
so the key to it all is homework !EXCLAMATIONMARK <BREAK>
he had to sit on a cushion ,COMMA stand still ,COMMA not move ,COMMA because it was very painful .PERIOD <BREAK>
we talked about this going all the way back to the end of the cold war .PERIOD <BREAK>
i started my career with trying to understand the mysteries of forests with the tools of science .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA the thing about cancer is that it's a disease of the aged .PERIOD <BREAK>
first of all ,COMMA you have to edit ruthlessly .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is not something i've made up .PERIOD <BREAK>
our cultural imagination about compassion has been deadened by idealistic images .PERIOD <BREAK>
plants are not living creatures -- this is the point .PERIOD <BREAK>
i'm going to talk about the role we members of society play in this phenomenon ,COMMA and about four different response levels we citizens have against violence .PERIOD <BREAK>
of course ,COMMA we can't forget africa .PERIOD <BREAK>
man :COLON ok ,COMMA hand me some more here .PERIOD man <NUM> :COLON ok .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's that simple .PERIOD <BREAK>
here ,COMMA here ,COMMA here .PERIOD have some money ,COMMA pleo .PERIOD <BREAK>
but the great change came ,COMMA of course ,COMMA with globalization and deregulation .PERIOD <BREAK>
but it was the countries that wanted it to go up ,COMMA and we let them push it up for all sorts of reasons .PERIOD so what you can do -- i've just said it .PERIOD don't just give one ,COMMA get one .PERIOD <BREAK>
i'll try to make that clear -- partially clear .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the answer is we're doing extremely poorly ;SEMICOLON it's a very hard problem .PERIOD <BREAK>
we can shop at three in the morning or eight at night ,COMMA ordering jeans tailor-made for our unique body-types .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the surgeons grabbed hold of it and said ,COMMA well ,COMMA i want to hold it like this ,COMMA or like that .PERIOD <BREAK>
we use those in my field of bone marrow transplantation .PERIOD <BREAK>
it can be sales ;SEMICOLON it can be you've got an award for something ;SEMICOLON it can be ,COMMA people have done it before ;SEMICOLON it can be your beta tests are going great .PERIOD <BREAK>
so i can ask you ,COMMA which direction is it rotating ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
so you can't tell much from just making the ball drop there ,COMMA but if we drop the ball and run the movie at the same time ,COMMA we can see that we have come up with an accurate physical model .PERIOD <BREAK>
this studies the circuitry in two people's brains that activates while they interact .PERIOD <BREAK>
they may be mountains ,COMMA but they may be just formulae ,COMMA just cranked on .PERIOD <BREAK>
i think there are any number of reasons ,COMMA and i'm just going to not get into detail but mention a few .PERIOD <BREAK>
when you use a mouse ,COMMA your hand is down here on the mouse pad .PERIOD <BREAK>
aravind ,COMMA which started as a seva project ,COMMA is now the world's largest and best eye hospital .PERIOD <BREAK>
australia ,COMMA for example ,COMMA is heavily dependent on exporting iron ore and natural gas to china .PERIOD <BREAK>
she is also immensely pragmatic .PERIOD <BREAK>
the first is mass collaboration ,COMMA represented here by wikipedia .PERIOD <BREAK>
i say to myself ,COMMA what planet do you come from ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
you'd be able to open portions in order to change the procession ,COMMA allow people to come in and out for an intermission ,COMMA or to enter for the beginning or the end of a performance .PERIOD <BREAK>
after a few years ,COMMA between five and seven years ,COMMA fish come back ,COMMA they eat the urchins ,COMMA and then the algae grow again .PERIOD <BREAK>
i feel confused and unsure of what the hell i want to do .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is a really exciting sequence of me sleeping .PERIOD <BREAK>
and sometimes we settle for the world as it is ,COMMA even when it doesn't reflect our values and aspirations .PERIOD <BREAK>
life is a string of choices creating a constant pressure to decide what to do next .PERIOD <BREAK>
you know ,COMMA that passion for what they're doing .PERIOD <BREAK>
even for the head of goldman sachs ,COMMA at least in part .PERIOD <BREAK>
but it's also really important that we don't get distracted by the theater or the morals of it .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the camera is looking down at her .PERIOD <BREAK>
i'm not an economist ,COMMA very much not ,COMMA but i did ,COMMA quite literally ,COMMA a back of the envelope calculation -- -- and it seems that for a cubic meter of concrete we would have to pay in the region of <NUM> dollars .PERIOD <BREAK>
we have a mission statement for our company doing migraine ,COMMA which is ,COMMA prevent or ameliorate migraine headaches by the application of a safe ,COMMA controlled magnetic pulse applied ,COMMA as needed ,COMMA by the patient .PERIOD <BREAK>
and that voice ,COMMA without losing a beat ,COMMA says ,COMMA 'because of late entry ,COMMA we're delayed <NUM> seconds .PERIOD ' just then ,COMMA everybody's looking at this couple with hateful eyes and the couple's going like this ,COMMA you know ,COMMA shrinking .PERIOD <BREAK>
this thing that looks like a peacock hit a windscreen is bill cheswick's map of the internet .PERIOD <BREAK>
now this is a very rare cancer ,COMMA this brd <NUM> -addicted cancer .PERIOD <BREAK>
you could call it the coca-cola approach if you like -- it was exactly the same thing .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's not very exciting ,COMMA but if you know what's there ,COMMA it's pretty emotional .PERIOD <BREAK>
from this point ,COMMA we're going to decelerate from <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> miles an hour down to <NUM> miles an hour .PERIOD <BREAK>
all those other values ,COMMA all those pages and pages of values that are full of nothing ,COMMA we summarize .PERIOD <BREAK>
so this idea of harnessing focused ultrasound to treat lesions in the brain is not new at all .PERIOD <BREAK>
and he saw that evolution itself was an intelligent process .PERIOD <BREAK>
they don't want to be an i .PERIOD p .PERIOD company ;SEMICOLON they want to be a chocolate company ,COMMA but they want to be a chocolate company forever .PERIOD <BREAK>
but now the question is :COLON how do you make it flow under and over in a piece of paper ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
governments snatch short-term opportunities and ,COMMA by the end of the conflict ,COMMA the chickens have come home to roost .PERIOD <BREAK>
we can get this information from the internet ,COMMA from the economist ,COMMA the financial times ,COMMA the new york times ,COMMA u .PERIOD s .PERIOD news and world report ,COMMA lots of sources like that ,COMMA or we can get it from asking experts who spend their lives studying places and problems ,COMMA because those experts know this information .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the adage that i'm referring to ,COMMA that applied at that time ,COMMA was that nothing comes down faster than a vtol aircraft upside down .PERIOD <BREAK>
if you'd have dropped a bomb on that room ,COMMA you'd have wiped out all the money in pennsylvania because it was all sitting there .PERIOD <BREAK>
i'm going to show you some of the separate bits of our index .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i can only try to speculate on how he did it .PERIOD <BREAK>
here's a physical robot that we actually have a population of brains ,COMMA competing ,COMMA or evolving on the machine .PERIOD <BREAK>
and to me the whole notion -- the things i'm photographing are out of a great concern about the scale of our progress and what we call progress .PERIOD <BREAK>
we had dr .PERIOD larry brilliant talking about how we eradicated smallpox .PERIOD <BREAK>
because it is in stage three that many of us move .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the journalist said ,COMMA why is there so little response out of washington ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and of course ,COMMA the u .PERIOD k .PERIOD benefited from some of that lovely oil wealth .PERIOD <BREAK>
people getting kidnapped ,COMMA where the oil comes from ,COMMA the oil that sometimes i think has driven us all crazy in nigeria .PERIOD <BREAK>
i mean it's probably the wet dream for a heart surgeon to be able to go inside of the patient's heart before you actually do surgery ,COMMA and do that with high-quality resolution data .PERIOD <BREAK>
and she said ,COMMA he wants to know who you are .PERIOD <BREAK>
so we took a hundred dollar bill and divided it into <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> teeny pieces ,COMMA and we fed those into the mechanical turk .PERIOD <BREAK>
and should they ever come in contact .PERIOD <BREAK>
of course ,COMMA the reality is quite different .PERIOD <BREAK>
i'm here today representing a team of artists and technologists and filmmakers that worked together on a remarkable film project for the last four years .PERIOD <BREAK>
there's two spheres and they're separated in distance .PERIOD <BREAK>
so you see ,COMMA the liquid metal battery story is more than an account of inventing technology ,COMMA it's a blueprint for inventing inventors ,COMMA full-spectrum .PERIOD <BREAK>
we have a program called justicemakers ,COMMA and we realized there are people that are courageous and want to do things ,COMMA but how can we support them ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and if you look at a guy called dennis ,COMMA when he decides what to become -- is it a lawyer ,COMMA or does he want to become a doctor or a teacher ?QUESTIONMARK -- best chance is that he wants to become a dentist .PERIOD <BREAK>
congo will go from <NUM> to <NUM> .PERIOD <BREAK>
and that's where i think organizations like ted ,COMMA like the extreme ice survey can have a terrific impact on human perception and bring us along .PERIOD <BREAK>
and he says ,COMMA like the humane society ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
in fact ,COMMA i'm afraid all of the best policies we have are not going to be enough .PERIOD <BREAK>
we also have things about how to make the bun .PERIOD <BREAK>
you do that because ,COMMA <NUM> years before ,COMMA an airborne sergeant had taught me to do that .PERIOD <BREAK>
a scuffle ensues and you get stabbed with one of your own arrowheads .PERIOD <BREAK>
they say ,COMMA you americans .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the prize has to be a verifiable thing ,COMMA so it's not about just ideas .PERIOD <BREAK>
while i was working at the u .PERIOD n .PERIOD i met this girl .PERIOD her name is lauren bush .PERIOD <BREAK>
and yudhisthira replied ,COMMA the most wondrous thing in the world is that all around us people can be dying and we don't realize it can happen to us .PERIOD <BREAK>
and someone ,COMMA at some point ,COMMA came up with this very bad idea that an ordinary individual couldn't make a difference in the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is worthy of sachin tendulkar .PERIOD <BREAK>
and what is dialogue really about ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
so that takes more time .PERIOD <BREAK>
wonderful engine .PERIOD <BREAK>
i'm trying to bring the experience that i had at swarthmore to africa .PERIOD <BREAK>
but you could feel sympathy for the reaction he had when he was told that his favorite painting was actually a forgery .PERIOD <BREAK>
in the infinitely complex network of relationships and connections that make up life .PERIOD <BREAK>
now ,COMMA you can see copious amounts of saliva in there .PERIOD [unclear] i call myself the unstable stable boy .PERIOD <BREAK>
hello .PERIOD my name is birke baehr ,COMMA and i'm <NUM> years old .PERIOD <BREAK>
there was a joke ,COMMA originally ,COMMA about my graph that i left out ,COMMA which is :COLON you see all this math ?QUESTIONMARK i'm just happy i was able to add it up to <NUM> ,COMMA because that's my skill set .PERIOD <BREAK>
okay .PERIOD sure .PERIOD <BREAK>
they began as casual vagina interviews ,COMMA and they turned into vagina monologues .PERIOD <BREAK>
the teachers that we work with -- and everything is different to teachers -- they tell us what to do .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i took blood from the bride and the groom and the wedding party and the family and the friends before and immediately after the vows .PERIOD <BREAK>
and you can sit in a room like this ,COMMA with a joystick and a headset ,COMMA and drive a robot like that around the bottom of the ocean in real time .PERIOD <BREAK>
when i imagine my life ,COMMA what my life would have been like without the educational opportunities that i had ,COMMA it makes me wonder .PERIOD <BREAK>
extractive :COLON taking raw materials from the earth .PERIOD <BREAK>
the protests ,COMMA the marches ,COMMA the uncompromising position that women's rights are human rights ,COMMA full stop .PERIOD <BREAK>
because at the end of the day ,COMMA it's about engagement .PERIOD <BREAK>
and that's to take isaac mizrahi's advice and confront the manipulation of it all ,COMMA and sort of admit that manipulation is something that we enjoy ,COMMA but also enjoy how it happens .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it started out quite a while ago when someone wrote one of the first successful computer viruses .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the reason i'm saying this is that you may have the idea this problem is relatively recent .PERIOD <BREAK>
and you know ,COMMA we have a society ,COMMA a world ,COMMA that is paralyzed by fear .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so we saw an opportunity to bring design as this untouched tool ,COMMA something that bertie county didn't otherwise have ,COMMA and to be sort of the -- to usher that in as a new type of tool in their tool kit .PERIOD <BREAK>
we are entering an epochal period of change in the world ,COMMA and -- certainly in america -- the period that will be characterized by the end of the cheap oil era .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it is a staggering <NUM> .PERIOD <NUM> trillion dollars .PERIOD <BREAK>
these are crinoids ,COMMA sponges ,COMMA black corals .PERIOD there're some more fishes .PERIOD <BREAK>
america is an empire .PERIOD <BREAK>
they systematically get things wrong and in the same ways that we do .PERIOD <BREAK>
as the sign said back there ,COMMA without limitations .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it turns out that manhattan had <NUM> different ecosystem types .PERIOD <BREAK>
here -- you see some are missing ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
but much more ,COMMA to get advices ,COMMA to give your comments ,COMMA to spread the word that if it's possible in the air ,COMMA of course it's possible in the ground .PERIOD <BREAK>
techno-archaeology is digging back and finding past miracles that never happened -- for good reason ,COMMA usually .PERIOD <BREAK>
thanks so much .PERIOD <BREAK>
i had somebody bring it there because i wanted to get access to al jazeera ,COMMA george bush's favorite channel and a place which i was very curious about because it's disliked by many governments across the arab world and also called the mouthpiece of osama bin laden by some people in the u .PERIOD s .PERIOD government .PERIOD <BREAK>
the clinical implication ,COMMA it comes from the domain of autism .PERIOD <BREAK>
so he had to resign .PERIOD isn't that nice ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and the world population in the meantime has doubled .PERIOD <BREAK>
since then ,COMMA the authors have won on <NUM> million distinct occasions ,COMMA publishing books .PERIOD <BREAK>
<NUM> years ago ,COMMA it took one man to infect an entire nation with the power of we can .PERIOD <BREAK>
now ,COMMA at that time ,COMMA the entity ,COMMA the legal cartel ,COMMA that controlled the performance rights for most of the music that would be broadcast using these technologies was ascap .PERIOD <BREAK>
a speck of snow ,COMMA an inch of ice ,COMMA the force of the wind ,COMMA can determine the result of a race or a game .PERIOD <BREAK>
you understand the full scope of the project .PERIOD <BREAK>
so let's take a look at the flu virus .PERIOD <BREAK>
but that's not really the question i'm asking .PERIOD <BREAK>
why is intel willing to fund that ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
creating so much torture was not something that was good for me ,COMMA too .PERIOD <BREAK>
i was at a wall .PERIOD <BREAK>
somehow i was more interested in pure manipulation than in all the silly little tricks in the box .PERIOD <BREAK>
i think we save five of clubs .PERIOD <BREAK>
and they're spreading from korea to brazil to india to the usa and across europe .PERIOD <BREAK>
so we decided to embrace an open source model of business -- that anyone ,COMMA anywhere in the world ,COMMA could start a local chapter ,COMMA and they can get involved in local problems .PERIOD <BREAK>
they had other sorts of brain damage .PERIOD <BREAK>
what we have extant right now ,COMMA at the beginning of this system ,COMMA is the u .PERIOD n .PERIOD security council as a grand jury .PERIOD <BREAK>
and that constant is the speed of sound .PERIOD <BREAK>
and with that ,COMMA we have found ourselves to be the world's policemen .PERIOD <BREAK>
the reason is that the system gets reimbursed for the kids they spit out the other end ,COMMA not the children who read .PERIOD <BREAK>
but ,COMMA actually ,COMMA we don't do that .PERIOD <BREAK>
and then they give you another test and they tell you you're hiv-positive ,COMMA and you're devastated .PERIOD <BREAK>
so the irony is that as these things became easier to use a less technical ,COMMA broader audience was coming into contact with this equipment for the first time .PERIOD <BREAK>
and how can we change that ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and that is the greatest present of all .PERIOD <BREAK>
and that dna aptamer will attach specifically to a target that you have selected for it .PERIOD <BREAK>
samuel pisar ,COMMA an auschwitz survivor ,COMMA said ,COMMA and i'll quote him ,COMMA the holocaust teaches us that nature ,COMMA even in its cruelest moments ,COMMA is benign in comparison with man ,COMMA when he loses his moral compass and his reason .PERIOD <BREAK>
i go home ,COMMA i look it up .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA what is it that we require ?QUESTIONMARK what is it that we need ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
so if the museum in toronto went out and collected a tyrannosaur ,COMMA a big one ,COMMA then the museum in ottawa wanted a bigger one and a better one .PERIOD <BREAK>
now you have understood the graph and now ,COMMA in the next <NUM> seconds ,COMMA we will play the hiv epidemic in the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
yeah .PERIOD <BREAK>
the plaque reads ,COMMA albert einstein lived here .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA i look to you ,COMMA fellow member of the earth community .PERIOD <BREAK>
knives and forks ?QUESTIONMARK no ,COMMA they're too dangerous .PERIOD <BREAK>
but there's a far worse danger confronting us .PERIOD <BREAK>
the cape breton piano playing is just awesome .PERIOD it's very rhythmic and ,COMMA you'll see it .PERIOD <BREAK>
warren .PERIOD <BREAK>
well ,COMMA that immediately turned into something much broader ,COMMA and as a scope .PERIOD <BREAK>
paul worked for years on the cameroonian national radio and television ,COMMA and he spoke about health issues .PERIOD he was a health correspondent .PERIOD <BREAK>
basically ,COMMA i celebrated every religious function .PERIOD <BREAK>
so this is a coffee machine .PERIOD just takes a few hundred rupees .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i would personally say that we have to craft new political realities ,COMMA not only in places like india ,COMMA afghanistan ,COMMA kenya ,COMMA pakistan ,COMMA what have you ,COMMA but here at home as well .PERIOD <BREAK>
i think it's about having to be prepared as communities ,COMMA not as individuals -- being prepared as nation ,COMMA being prepared as state ,COMMA being prepared as town .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA what i'd like to show you is what it would take to hold <NUM> pounds of highly enriched uranium .PERIOD <BREAK>
and while these are both wonderful things in their own right -- they both have very wonderful things going for them -- truth and beauty as ideals that can be looked at by the sciences and by math are almost like the ideal conjoined twins that a scientist would want to date .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the defenders began to take cases over and over again and you will see ,COMMA they have step by step began to change the course of history in cambodia .PERIOD <BREAK>
now ,COMMA in the process of doing this over here ,COMMA how do you remember the sequences and doers ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
that's full immunization .PERIOD <BREAK>
it'll also help us a lot ,COMMA if we meet an advanced civilization along the way ,COMMA if we're trying to be an advanced civilization .PERIOD number eight -- sp :COLON you've got it !EXCLAMATIONMARK you've got the job .PERIOD <BREAK>
so .PERIOD moderator :COLON that's it .PERIOD <BREAK>
these are some of the meals that i've been cooking at home .PERIOD <BREAK>

there's a bunch of very exciting stuff which we are doing .PERIOD <BREAK>
everything up here's ok ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
come on :COLON those masterpieces .PERIOD <BREAK>
this website is already up ,COMMA it's already got a bunch of stories ,COMMA a lot of ideas .PERIOD it's called once upon a school ,COMMA which is a great title ,COMMA i think .PERIOD <BREAK>
let's think about data for a bit .PERIOD <BREAK>
so we have three of world's top economists write about climate change .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the entry point for his right hand -- notice this ,COMMA he's not reaching in front and catching the water .PERIOD <BREAK>
instead ,COMMA these people drink a little bit every day ,COMMA not a hard sell to the american population .PERIOD <BREAK>

what i have learned is two things .PERIOD one :COLON that the epidemic of violence towards women is shocking ;SEMICOLON it's global ;SEMICOLON it is so profound and it is so devastating ,COMMA and it is so in every little pocket of every little crater ,COMMA of every little society ,COMMA that we don't even recognize it because it's become ordinary .PERIOD this journey has taken me to afghanistan ,COMMA where i had the extraordinary honor and privilege to go into parts of afghanistan under the taliban -- i was dressed in a burqa -- and i went in with an extraordinary group called the revolutionary association of the women of afghanistan ,COMMA and i saw firsthand how women had been stripped of every single right that was possible to strip women of -- from being educated ,COMMA to being employed ,COMMA to being actually allowed to eat ice cream .PERIOD <BREAK>

i actually get phone calls from people who want to know what lottery numbers are going to win .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA the examples that i gave you are these islands of mesh networks ,COMMA and networks are interesting only as they are big .PERIOD <BREAK>
and my partner byron lichtenberg and i carefully suspended him into zero-g .PERIOD <BREAK>

we want kids to think ,COMMA i'm the hero in waiting ,COMMA waiting for the right situation to come along ,COMMA and i will act heroically .PERIOD <BREAK>
many of us -- maybe now me -- think we should do that .PERIOD <BREAK>
and here it is ,COMMA figure-ground .PERIOD <BREAK>
we need to spend more time appreciating what already exists ,COMMA and less time agonizing over what else we can do .PERIOD <BREAK>
so in close ,COMMA as you think about technology trends and how to impact health and medicine ,COMMA we're entering an era of miniaturization ,COMMA decentralization and personalization .PERIOD <BREAK>
the digital universe is the basis of our space show productions that we do -- our main space shows in the dome .PERIOD <BREAK>

and in this case ,COMMA we're imagining intermediary robotic devices that can actually do some of that front-end work for us ,COMMA to protect any potential life that we find .PERIOD <BREAK>
at that moment ,COMMA they fired and shot off my fingers .PERIOD <BREAK>
not that we could have afforded i drive ,COMMA but to give me the dream of driving .PERIOD <BREAK>
but what they assure in its place is mediocrity .PERIOD <BREAK>
now a block of limestone ,COMMA in itself ,COMMA isn't particularly that interesting .PERIOD <BREAK>
because they let you keep continence ,COMMA bladder control ,COMMA and sexual function after surgery ,COMMA all of which is generally fairly important to the patient .PERIOD <BREAK>

you end up flocking with a lot of people who are probably similar to you ,COMMA who have similar interests .PERIOD <BREAK>

so ,COMMA i share it with all of you here today ,COMMA though the idea itself is getting crystallized and i'm still writing up the business plan .PERIOD <BREAK>
now ,COMMA as we pull down here ,COMMA we still have a whole set of creatures living on the surface of the planet .PERIOD there are all these different dynamics going on here .PERIOD <BREAK>

so ,COMMA if we're going to ensure the delivery of the key public goods at an international level -- in this case ,COMMA in the global supply chain -- we have to come up with a different mechanism .PERIOD <BREAK>
now this is the same adam smith who ,COMMA <NUM> years later ,COMMA would write a little book called the wealth of nations -- the founding document of economics .PERIOD <BREAK>
the electoral commissioner declared ,COMMA with the consent of the parties ,COMMA to run an unprecedented second re-run .PERIOD <BREAK>

nathaniel kahn :COLON if he did he was a very lucky man .PERIOD <BREAK>

and so for me that was the thing that was so enticing .PERIOD <BREAK>
okay ?QUESTIONMARK ready ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>

you would expect a city like this to have upgraded flower boxes on michigan avenue where wealthy people shop ,COMMA but if you actually go along the street you find the flower boxes change from street to street :COLON there's actual diversity in the plants .PERIOD <BREAK>

if we go back <NUM> years ,COMMA the one message pretty much controlled by one marketing manager could pretty much define a brand .PERIOD <BREAK>
but i didn't have to cut any of them really ,COMMA because i just lined up their jaws and it turned out the biggest one had <NUM> teeth and the next smallest one had <NUM> and the next smallest had <NUM> .PERIOD <BREAK>
the device could be implanted under the scalp to be totally hidden and avoid wire breakage ,COMMA which occurs if you put it in the chest and you try to move your neck around .PERIOD <BREAK>

but you don't say that ,COMMA because they're the guys you're targeting .PERIOD <BREAK>
their names are patrice and patee .PERIOD <BREAK>
that is an externality by definition .PERIOD <BREAK>
and being from the silicon valley ,COMMA sort of utopian sort of world ,COMMA we thought ,COMMA if we can make this technology work in rural uganda ,COMMA we might have something .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i live down there ,COMMA so we spent a lot of time looking at the need .PERIOD <BREAK>
the expanded aims will be a coherent pan-african institution ,COMMA and its graduates will form a powerful network ,COMMA working together for peace and progress across the continent .PERIOD <BREAK>

in the meanwhile ,COMMA the old mentality with a capital o ,COMMA was represented by his father ,COMMA the head of the nigerian bank ,COMMA warning the cia that his own son was about to attack ,COMMA and this warning fell on deaf ears .PERIOD <BREAK>

surely the kinds of play that at least american media give to -- and forgive me ,COMMA but in raw numbers these are very tiny accidents .PERIOD <BREAK>
and even people who faced the rebellion of <NUM> ,COMMA after our independence ,COMMA they didn't believe what was happening .PERIOD <BREAK>

now of course ,COMMA this does not mean that we should all stop collaborating -- and case in point ,COMMA is steve wozniak famously coming together with steve jobs to start apple computer -- but it does mean that solitude matters and that for some people it is the air that they breathe .PERIOD <BREAK>

for those of you who remember your physics ,COMMA that's a zero-angular-momentum righting response .PERIOD but it's like a cat .PERIOD <BREAK>

we can do it because in space there are no aerodynamics .PERIOD <BREAK>
and you enclose that with something that also is central to its appearance ,COMMA which is a mesh of triangulated structures -- again ,COMMA in a long connection evocative of some of those works of buckminster fuller ,COMMA and the way in which triangulation can increase performance and also give that building its sense of identity .PERIOD <BREAK>

you either go up ,COMMA or you come down .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so i was wondering ,COMMA when we were trying to reproduce the work with the skier ,COMMA that we noticed that ,COMMA of course ,COMMA she had no oxygen consumption ,COMMA and so maybe she was in a similar state of suspended animation .PERIOD <BREAK>
we specialize in high quality facial animation for video games and films .PERIOD <BREAK>

it's louder than noise at a range of a thousand kilometers .PERIOD <BREAK>
so close your eyes .PERIOD <BREAK>
there are two things involved -- two parts to the explanation .PERIOD <BREAK>

to show you how schizophrenic this all is ,COMMA here's the head of myspace ,COMMA or fox interactive ,COMMA a news corp company ,COMMA being asked ,COMMA well ,COMMA with the writers' strike ,COMMA isn't this going to hurt news corp and help you online ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>

glamour is a magic spell .PERIOD <BREAK>
i became obsessed with how it might be that we're embedded in these social networks ,COMMA and how they affect our lives .PERIOD <BREAK>
and this is an interesting icon that happened -- you remember these :COLON fallout shelters .PERIOD <BREAK>
instead ,COMMA it's folks getting together to do something for fun ,COMMA rather than because they were told to ,COMMA or because they were expecting to make a mint off of it .PERIOD <BREAK>
how do you know ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
we see people in their twenties are the most prolific ,COMMA followed by teenagers ,COMMA and then people in their thirties ,COMMA and it dies out very quickly from there .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is where it gets weird .PERIOD <BREAK>
marketing creates user groups .PERIOD <BREAK>
do you realize that if you had started building the parthenon on the day you were born ,COMMA you would be all done in only one more year ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
it was not that painting ,COMMA but that painting .PERIOD <BREAK>

instead ,COMMA i'm going to mention my mom ,COMMA who passed away last summer .PERIOD <BREAK>
because sometime i feel like stopping and not doing it ,COMMA because i didn't know what i was putting myself into .PERIOD <BREAK>

that's your salary .PERIOD <BREAK>

anagnorisis and peripeteia .PERIOD <BREAK>
let's take the twisted six-pointed starfish .PERIOD <BREAK>

they have to try and attract pollinators to do their bidding .PERIOD <BREAK>
and they said they'd spend all this time .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so we spend a very good sort of three months away together .PERIOD <BREAK>
not to mention what it reveals about the adult who's speaking them .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is a fee-pay school .PERIOD this is a good school .PERIOD <BREAK>
because you've agreed on <NUM> percent of things ,COMMA because you have a shared view on so many things ,COMMA and you politely differ .PERIOD <BREAK>
it became a killer app of links ,COMMA and today ,COMMA of course ,COMMA we call that the world wide web .PERIOD <BREAK>
and on the right we learn that there's a new way to support your breast .PERIOD <BREAK>
what do we do with displaced fellow earthlings who no longer have a home on the planet ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
they don't come quickly to mind ,COMMA and as a result ,COMMA we vastly underestimate them .PERIOD <BREAK>
and maybe this is just a san francisco thing -- i don't know ,COMMA i don't want to judge .PERIOD <BREAK>
so everybody wants to have an english education ,COMMA naturally .PERIOD <BREAK>
i'd like to talk about what i call digital food .PERIOD <BREAK>
but this is another ,COMMA this is the grand canal ,COMMA which was constructed in the first instance in the fifth century b .PERIOD c .PERIOD <BREAK>
how can we get away from the mouse and use our full bodies as a way of exploring aesthetic experiences ,COMMA not necessarily utilitarian ones .PERIOD <BREAK>
the density of matter is finite ,COMMA and we have a chance of a consistent set of equations that can describe the whole process .PERIOD <BREAK>
we have opportunities in solid minerals .PERIOD we have a lot of minerals that no one has even invested in or explored .PERIOD and we realized that without the proper legislation to make that possible ,COMMA that wouldn't happen .PERIOD so we've now got a mining code that is comparable with some of the best in the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA when we have these calls for proposals ,COMMA i try to find a match between my potential ideas and the problem .PERIOD if there is a match we write a research proposal ,COMMA get the research funding in ,COMMA and that's how we start our research programs .PERIOD <BREAK>
the bankers stayed with their loan recipients .PERIOD <BREAK>
so we are working now on a non-invasive -- again ,COMMA these are all invasive studies .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i caught the guys ,COMMA and they turned out to be working for what was then the soviet kgb ,COMMA and stealing information and selling it .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's a company in san diego called flex-foot .PERIOD <BREAK>
you're not paid to change size class .PERIOD <BREAK>
but she also found osteocytes ,COMMA which are the cells that laid down the bones .PERIOD <BREAK>
one :COLON production is too low .PERIOD two :COLON price is too high .PERIOD <BREAK>
we use the premack principle .PERIOD <BREAK>
and then we talk about organic food .PERIOD <BREAK>
just know where i came from ,COMMA why i did the jugaad .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the grandmother had never let any westerners ever see her .PERIOD <BREAK>
i mean that's the essence of it all .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is the initiative that's been coordinated by conservation international with a variety of partners and governments to actually try to bring integrated management regime throughout the area .PERIOD <BREAK>
and if i succeed in doing that ,COMMA maybe you would go back with the thought that you could build on ,COMMA and perhaps help me do my work .PERIOD <BREAK>
so this is our last number ,COMMA and we'll feature nat on piano .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i did .PERIOD we started to redesign them ,COMMA one by one .PERIOD <BREAK>
part of the reason why we value these traits is that they make us better at competing with other people -- they're positional goods .PERIOD <BREAK>
but ,COMMA that's not true .PERIOD <BREAK>
anybody with five or less digits ,COMMA you've got to sit down ,COMMA because you've underestimated .PERIOD <BREAK>
you must do it differently .PERIOD <BREAK>
don't even worry .PERIOD <BREAK>
now ,COMMA the buttermilk that you get is actually low-fat or skim milk .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's that little green sliver on the horizon ,COMMA which makes them very nervous about rising oceans .PERIOD <BREAK>
this model ,COMMA a model of overlap ,COMMA is the way to move forward .PERIOD <BREAK>
a signal in the brain that triggers brain dysfunction might be sensed as a trigger for electro-stimulation like we're doing with epilepsy .PERIOD <BREAK>
ja ,COMMA well i could have translated that ,COMMA but you would have been none the wiser .PERIOD <BREAK>
and then it comes to rest .PERIOD just a little thing about time .PERIOD <BREAK>
so beautiful that i will even give up a laugh to explain my love of this particular planet ,COMMA and the day saturday ,COMMA named after it ,COMMA wonderfully .PERIOD <BREAK>
and we can see places where stars are forming ,COMMA like the eagle nebula .PERIOD we see stars dying .PERIOD <BREAK>
really .PERIOD because we had found a way to de-animate a mammal ,COMMA and it didn't hurt it .PERIOD <BREAK>
here ,COMMA you've got martian alphabet .PERIOD <BREAK>
yes ,COMMA things will get ugly ,COMMA and it will happen soon -- certainly in our lifetime -- but we are more than capable of getting through everything that's coming .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's typical of these hallucinations that they may come in a flash and disappear in a flash .PERIOD <BREAK>
and now we've got to look to the future .PERIOD <BREAK>
and that is to focus on a few critical objectives .PERIOD <BREAK>
so the image is that we're not only on a treadmill that's going faster ,COMMA but we have to change the treadmill faster and faster .PERIOD <BREAK>
what we've done is we've created economies .PERIOD <BREAK>
we think we're getting this wide view of the globe .PERIOD <BREAK>
but i can offer some natural light and year-round climate control .PERIOD <BREAK>
not right now .PERIOD wait till i finish talking .PERIOD <BREAK>
now all this fuss about a single one of our traits tells us there's something worth explaining .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the tourist brochures pointed me in the direction of this bridge -- i love bridges ,COMMA metaphorically and symbolically and structurally -- and it was a bit of a disappointment ,COMMA because of the sludge from the river was encrusted on it ;SEMICOLON it really wasn't in use .PERIOD <BREAK>
well ,COMMA worldchanging you might think of as being a bit of a news service for the unimaginable future .PERIOD <BREAK>
i used to think ,COMMA well is it cambodia ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>

i went through about <NUM> surgeries ,COMMA and it seemed impossible to do that when i was in kidney failure when i was <NUM> .PERIOD <BREAK>
i guess we could make a glow chicken .PERIOD <BREAK>
we could just re-label things .PERIOD <BREAK>
they were going to make it fun for me .PERIOD <BREAK>
with that preamble ,COMMA let's show the first two-minute videotape ,COMMA which shows a little airplane for surveillance and moving to a giant airplane .PERIOD <BREAK>
and now it can go on other surfaces because of the new adhesive that the stanford group was able to do in designing this incredible robot .PERIOD <BREAK>
i'm a product of opportunities ,COMMA rare opportunities in the ' <NUM> s and the ' <NUM> s ,COMMA which girls didn't get ,COMMA and i was conscious of the fact that what my parents were giving me was something unique .PERIOD <BREAK>
now that's all very easy to draw graphs and things like that ,COMMA but the point is we need to turn those curves .PERIOD <BREAK>
how does that impact our desert culture ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and at the same time ,COMMA i'm extremely aware how boring it is to hear about other people's happinesses .PERIOD <BREAK>
and then he asked me -- and this is something i will never forget in my life -- he just asked me ,COMMA you're the good pilot up there .PERIOD <BREAK>

so we're not -- we're pretty kludge-y ourselves .PERIOD <BREAK>
they're found everywhere on the planet except for the arctic and the southern tip of south america .PERIOD <BREAK>
and we commissioned them to make a maquette ,COMMA or a bust ,COMMA of benjamin .PERIOD <BREAK>
and during the evolution of life on the earth ,COMMA it was the colonization of the land by plants that helped create the benign climate we currently enjoy .PERIOD <BREAK>
because ,COMMA you know ,COMMA most people ,COMMA when they hear that i predict that a lot of people alive today are going to live to <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> or more ,COMMA they think that i'm saying that we're going to invent therapies in the next few decades that are so thoroughly eliminating aging that those therapies will let us live to <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> or more .PERIOD <BREAK>
ostensibly ,COMMA he's dead now .PERIOD <BREAK>
so when we see e equals mc squared come along ,COMMA from a poet's perspective ,COMMA we see energy as physics ,COMMA chemistry as mass ,COMMA and all of a sudden ,COMMA you get this biology .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i woke up one day and i said ,COMMA i don't need prozac anymore .PERIOD <BREAK>
and because my urban trance had been somehow weakened ,COMMA i found myself stopping to find out what was wrong .PERIOD <BREAK>
we could talk about government data ,COMMA enterprise data is really important ,COMMA there's scientific data ,COMMA there's personal data ,COMMA there's weather data ,COMMA there's data about events ,COMMA there's data about talks ,COMMA and there's news and there's all kinds of stuff .PERIOD <BREAK>
all right ,COMMA if this view of language and its value in solving the crisis of visual theft is true ,COMMA any species that acquires it should show an explosion of creativity and prosperity .PERIOD <BREAK>
and when you feed these kids bad food ,COMMA that's what they're learning .PERIOD so that's really what this is all about .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the answer is :COLON all of them .PERIOD <BREAK>
but i would suggest that innovation without imitation is a complete waste of time .PERIOD <BREAK>
now ,COMMA after searching high and low for several months ,COMMA i discovered that there was a type of molecule called a borane which has exactly the same vibration .PERIOD <BREAK>
because when children play a role ,COMMA they actually follow social scripts quite closely that they’ve learnt from us as adults .PERIOD <BREAK>
and cape cod ,COMMA there are idyllic roads ,COMMA and all of us can drive in this room .PERIOD <BREAK>
and same thing for invertebrates .PERIOD this is the example .PERIOD <BREAK>
anything that makes me think .PERIOD anything that i don't understand ,COMMA where i have to make the leap myself ,COMMA in my own head ,COMMA is going to stop the flow of the presentation .PERIOD <BREAK>
so the cambrian explosion ,COMMA when all the body plans of the animals were evolved ,COMMA took only <NUM> million years .PERIOD it was <NUM> times faster .PERIOD <BREAK>
you know ,COMMA a lot of people risk their lives in a brief act of heroism ,COMMA which is kind of cool ,COMMA but jill has what i call slow heroism .PERIOD <BREAK>
one of them i'm starting from almost nothing ,COMMA but the other one ,COMMA i wanted to find out what's going on that's working right now .PERIOD <BREAK>
i see a lot of children .PERIOD they are walking up and down stairs .PERIOD <BREAK>
here's an octopus moving across the reef ,COMMA finds a spot to settle down ,COMMA curls up and then disappears into the background .PERIOD <BREAK>

when i went traveling ,COMMA i remember ,COMMA i met this fabulous old man ,COMMA who i met when i was caricaturing ,COMMA who turned out to be an artist ,COMMA in italy .PERIOD <BREAK>
what ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>

so .PERIOD <BREAK>
why aren't you ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and on the other side there was a rising sun .PERIOD <BREAK>
i got interested in them because they're the most extreme example of a surface where the texture and the -- let's call it the decoration -- i know the frog doesn't think of it as decoration ,COMMA but that's how it works -- are all intricately connected to one another .PERIOD <BREAK>
thank you very much .PERIOD <BREAK>
they can be pushed off-center a little bit ,COMMA but in the end you actually still get as much of that original spectrum as you originally had hoped .PERIOD <BREAK>
the fetus incorporates these offerings into its own body ,COMMA makes them part of its flesh and blood .PERIOD <BREAK>
it has an indefinitely expandable page for each species .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i will try and explain to you what’s wrong with this notion .PERIOD <BREAK>
so it's acting with its two mouths there .PERIOD <BREAK>
these images are shot really anonymously to the point where it could be anyone .PERIOD <BREAK>
so insects ,COMMA just for free ,COMMA contribute to the economy of the united states with about the same order of magnitude ,COMMA just for free ,COMMA without everyone knowing .PERIOD <BREAK>
the point that i would like to ask you to try to do ,COMMA is just in <NUM> seconds -- and i know this is in a sense an impossible task -- write down what you think is probably some of the top priorities .PERIOD <BREAK>

and he said something like ,COMMA me .PERIOD boy .PERIOD symphony .PERIOD beethoven .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so it's giving people more choices ,COMMA but it's not taking away choices .PERIOD <BREAK>
so just looking at this heart ,COMMA i can play back a video here .PERIOD <BREAK>
and what you said ,COMMA lakshmi ,COMMA is absolutely true :COLON it's not just ratan tata ,COMMA it's the house of tatas over time .PERIOD <BREAK>
so what can we do about that ?QUESTIONMARK what can we say ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
problems become puzzles and obstacles disappear .PERIOD <BREAK>
our team ,COMMA befittingly i think ,COMMA named it after one of those dreamers of the copernican time ,COMMA johannes kepler ,COMMA and that telescope's sole purpose is to go out ,COMMA find the planets that orbit other stars in our galaxy ,COMMA and tell us how often do planets like our own earth happen to be out there .PERIOD <BREAK>
to do this ,COMMA at a certain point ,COMMA you need someone to bump you out of your flock and into another flock .PERIOD <BREAK>

and he built me up ,COMMA you know ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>

the matriarch that they were radio tracking ,COMMA after weeks of moving back and forth ,COMMA in and out of the park ,COMMA came to a halt outside the park .PERIOD <BREAK>
trouble in the valley ,COMMA and trouble by the river too .PERIOD <BREAK>
why are we still stuck in afghanistan ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
the vaccine effort though is really quite different .PERIOD <BREAK>
they said only one percent .PERIOD because that's sadistic behavior ,COMMA and we know ,COMMA psychiatry knows ,COMMA only one percent of americans are sadistic .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA this is the capery where you get fitted for your cape ,COMMA and then you walk up these three steel-graded steps and then we turn on three hydraulic fans from every side and then you can see the cape in action .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is actually showing a piece of muscle and how we go through the structures to actually engineer the muscle .PERIOD <BREAK>
but i think he will change his mind soon .PERIOD <BREAK>
in america they say a period stop .PERIOD <BREAK>
and almost straightaway we actually run up against a couple of anomalies .PERIOD <BREAK>
last in reading ,COMMA math and science .PERIOD last .PERIOD <BREAK>
i feel gypped out of something awesome here .PERIOD <BREAK>
and when the vaccine appeared last winter ,COMMA there were a lot of people -- a surprising number -- who refused to get it -- as a nice example of how people's feelings of security change ,COMMA how their model changes ,COMMA sort of wildly with no new information ,COMMA with no new input .PERIOD <BREAK>
on one side financial ,COMMA on the other side social .PERIOD <BREAK>
they're immensely powerful social institutions and many of their features can be traced back to earlier features that we can really make sense of by reverse engineering .PERIOD <BREAK>
right now ,COMMA we don't have that but i'm very sure that we will be able to do that at some stage .PERIOD <BREAK>
you'll hear about talks like ,COMMA can a video game make you cry ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
many people argue that the <NUM> st century is going to repeat the <NUM> th century ,COMMA in which world war one ,COMMA the great conflagration in which the european state system tore itself apart and destroyed its centrality in the world ,COMMA that that was caused by the rise in the power of germany and the fear it created in britain .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's not just throwing them out at random .PERIOD <BREAK>
ask them really interesting questions .PERIOD <BREAK>
and this was yet another famine in ethiopia .PERIOD <BREAK>
and look here when i take you into my bubble graphs .PERIOD <BREAK>
and she said ,COMMA you know what ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and it's all brute force .PERIOD and that's the way we've been approaching energy .PERIOD so the lesson in agriculture is that you can actually change the system that's based on brute force as you start merging that system and learning that system and actually applying biology .PERIOD and you move from a discipline of engineering ,COMMA you move from a discipline of chemistry ,COMMA into a discipline of biology .PERIOD and probably one of the most important human beings on the planet is this guy behind me .PERIOD <BREAK>
i know ;SEMICOLON i spent a lot of my career in artificial intelligence ,COMMA trying to build machines that could do some of this thinking for us ,COMMA that could give us answers .PERIOD <BREAK>
we don't have a language for it yet .PERIOD <BREAK>
so to make matters even more difficult ,COMMA it's a very young planet .PERIOD <BREAK>
and when it fires a little spike of electricity ,COMMA there's going to be a red dot and a click .PERIOD <BREAK>
is biology special ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
talent ,COMMA background ,COMMA education ,COMMA freedom ,COMMA networks ,COMMA opportunities ,COMMA wealth ,COMMA ideas ,COMMA creativity .PERIOD <BREAK>
so in aurora ,COMMA colorado it's a bench .PERIOD <BREAK>
so they would catch parts of the images ,COMMA and make sort of three-dimensional color volumes ,COMMA as you walk through it ,COMMA through the object .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA he or she sits down ,COMMA animates it ,COMMA and tries to anticipate what's going to happen ,COMMA and then these particular animations are just played back at appropriate times in the computer game .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA it's an important demonstration of the power of motion .PERIOD <BREAK>
maybe some things are bad traditions and they need to be changed .PERIOD <BREAK>
what ?QUESTIONMARK i said ,COMMA stop .PERIOD <BREAK>
a lot of reporters come to yemen and they want to write a story on al-qaeda or terrorism .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i think there are really three things we can take away from coca-cola .PERIOD <BREAK>
but there's also a dialogue between the videos ,COMMA where ,COMMA once the basic structure is established ,COMMA it becomes a kind of platform for articulating the similarities and differences between the groups' social and physical worlds .PERIOD <BREAK>
and this can be a problem ,COMMA as i learned .PERIOD <BREAK>
we get the generators from the companies .PERIOD <BREAK>
i literally drew on the walls of the trailer ,COMMA mocked it up in cardboard ,COMMA we'd come in and cut ,COMMA decide things were wrong ,COMMA pull it out ,COMMA put it back in .PERIOD <BREAK>
i studied cooking in school for four years ,COMMA and in that experience ,COMMA which was called domestic science ,COMMA it was a bit of a cheap trick for me to try and get a science qualification .PERIOD <BREAK>
my agency is working closely with columbia university and others to shine a light on these issues .PERIOD <BREAK>
again ,COMMA inward out .PERIOD <BREAK>
thank you .PERIOD <BREAK>
how does evolution do cumulative ,COMMA combinatorial things ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and now the one on the dark surround looks lighter than the one on the light surround .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's games that fit into a healthy lifestyle .PERIOD <BREAK>
spades ?QUESTIONMARK spades ,COMMA good .PERIOD <BREAK>
there we can see fibonacci numbers related to the golden section ,COMMA because fibonacci and golden section relate to the unfolding of the measured meter of matter ,COMMA as i refer to it .PERIOD <BREAK>
if compassion is so good for us ,COMMA why don't we train our health care providers in compassion so that they can do what they're supposed to do ,COMMA which is to really transform suffering ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
so i scraped the slime off and i sent it off to aberdeen .PERIOD <BREAK>
what is this ?QUESTIONMARK i don't want to swear on the web .PERIOD <BREAK>
and that guy pushed himself back from the table .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's really an island continent .PERIOD <BREAK>
they all have two-ness in them .PERIOD <BREAK>
some of the happiest days of my life have been spent .PERIOD <BREAK>
three of them never showed up .PERIOD one of them asked us if we would stay with hybrids and they would give us a discount .PERIOD <BREAK>
so we say ,COMMA area-denial ,COMMA anti-access asymmetrical strategies and their eyes glaze over .PERIOD <BREAK>
but i'm really afraid we need much ,COMMA much more .PERIOD <BREAK>
and then i'm going spend perhaps the second half of the talk talking about ,COMMA you know ,COMMA how we might actually be able to prove that fatalism is wrong ,COMMA namely ,COMMA by actually doing something about it .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA let's start off with the positive control first ,COMMA where we know the person was healthy .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's because they said ,COMMA it's eight to <NUM> dollars an hour and <NUM> dollars a day .PERIOD <BREAK>
now ,COMMA incredible as this sounds ,COMMA i once met a papuan man ,COMMA and i asked him if this could possibly be true .PERIOD <BREAK>
other people make the opposite trip .PERIOD <BREAK>
for example ,COMMA the great oxford historian who taught here at this university ,COMMA a .PERIOD j .PERIOD p .PERIOD taylor ,COMMA defined a great power as a country able to prevail in war .PERIOD <BREAK>
so those two are ideal and complementary areas from which flow is easy to go into .PERIOD <BREAK>
thank you .PERIOD <BREAK>
the first was a series of renovations of computer labs .PERIOD <BREAK>
how would you tell the time ,COMMA say ,COMMA <NUM> years ago ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
who is she ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
but i'm not going to change anything within those boxes ,COMMA except their meaning .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's good for maybe home schoolers .PERIOD <BREAK>
instead they're talking about their next nature walk ,COMMA exchanging recipes ,COMMA and yes ,COMMA they pray .PERIOD <BREAK>
and naturally ,COMMA i encounter a lot of resistance ,COMMA because it's considered to be anti-intellectual and counter to serious learning .PERIOD <BREAK>
and if you look at this image -- here we are now in september the <NUM> th -- you're going to see a few cases light up .PERIOD <BREAK>
we all know how hard it is to admit weakness and failure .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it's a great story ,COMMA because what happened was he got off the plane at the toronto airport ,COMMA and he was welcomed by a non-profit group ,COMMA which i'm sure someone in this room runs .PERIOD <BREAK>
he's also in an old age home ,COMMA he's in a nursing home around other old people ,COMMA so he had to look exactly the same as the others .PERIOD <BREAK>
and with this photograph of a beautiful <NUM> -feet ,COMMA probably <NUM> -feet ,COMMA i guess ,COMMA female tiger shark ,COMMA i sort of think i got to that goal ,COMMA where she was swimming with these little barjacks off her nose ,COMMA and my strobe created a shadow on her face .PERIOD <BREAK>
here's a map a lawyer made .PERIOD he put on it the water plant ,COMMA and which houses are there ,COMMA which houses have been connected to the water .PERIOD <BREAK>
and then ,COMMA of course ,COMMA you have to do something about how to moderate that ,COMMA so that anybody can -- so they'll listen to you .PERIOD <BREAK>
what is this going to result in ?QUESTIONMARK are we going to really build intelligent machines ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
now ,COMMA there's another part of that community which are the commercial beekeepers ,COMMA the ones who make their livelihood from beekeeping alone .PERIOD <BREAK>
but dough is what we're working with ,COMMA and we take that dough to the oven ,COMMA and it goes into the oven .PERIOD as soon as the interior temperature of that dough crosses the threshold of <NUM> degrees ,COMMA it passes what we call the thermal death point .PERIOD <BREAK>
all right .PERIOD so the rest of you can save them for when i say something particularly boring ,COMMA and then you can fire at me .PERIOD <BREAK>
here's the dna sequence ,COMMA here's the protein sequence in order to do it .PERIOD <BREAK>
you don't have to think about some exotic examples ,COMMA or fossils .PERIOD <BREAK>
and tv ,COMMA satellite and cable revenues are way up .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is called the capgras delusion ,COMMA and that is a patient ,COMMA who's otherwise completely normal ,COMMA has had a head injury ,COMMA comes out of coma ,COMMA otherwise completely normal ,COMMA he looks at his mother and says ,COMMA this looks exactly like my mother ,COMMA this woman ,COMMA but she's an impostor .PERIOD <BREAK>
we forgot about improving normal lives .PERIOD <BREAK>
again of course that's what we do ,COMMA both in a molecular way ,COMMA and also in an outward way ,COMMA but i think about the molecular stuff .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's pretty obvious ,COMMA they're coming from india .PERIOD <BREAK>
and one key way that we're going to do this is to introduce this book club .PERIOD <BREAK>
video :COLON narrator :COLON the wild bonobo lives in central africa ,COMMA in the jungle encircled by the congo river .PERIOD <BREAK>
♫ we don't need no more trouble ♫ ♫ no more trouble ♫ ♫ we don't need no more trouble ♫ ♫ no more trouble .PERIOD ♫ wake up !EXCLAMATIONMARK everybody wake up .PERIOD road block !EXCLAMATIONMARK <BREAK>
all right ,COMMA we'll do this trick ,COMMA but please remember it took us over <NUM> years to perfect .PERIOD <BREAK>
but he knows where it was ,COMMA so he knows to go and get it .PERIOD <BREAK>
hence ,COMMA you could share some of your nutritional resources instead of monopolizing them .PERIOD <BREAK>
developing the skycar has been a real challenge .PERIOD <BREAK>
sometimes i get help from the universe ,COMMA it seems .PERIOD <BREAK>
and we did this passively by looking at whether or not they'd gone to university health services .PERIOD <BREAK>
to put it mildly ,COMMA i didn't do very well .PERIOD <BREAK>
the nitrogen has two problems .PERIOD <BREAK>
and my daily language is english .PERIOD <BREAK>
there might be storms ,COMMA but the depth of the ocean is still there ,COMMA unchanged .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so ,COMMA i thought perhaps incarcerated men and women -- who don't have access to nature ,COMMA who often have a lot of time ,COMMA they often have space ,COMMA and you don't need any sharp tools to work with mosses -- would be great partners .PERIOD <BREAK>
they started telling the west ,COMMA be aware of al-qaeda .PERIOD <BREAK>
and you can see that the green neuron touches the red neuron at two locations ,COMMA and these are what are called synapses .PERIOD <BREAK>
her mother died while giving birth to her ,COMMA and no one had any idea who her father was .PERIOD <BREAK>
and do you think kids ,COMMA you know ,COMMA skateboarders ,COMMA surfers ,COMMA rock climbers ,COMMA would use these things ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
he triggered the modernist revolution .PERIOD <BREAK>
so it's exciting potential for this .PERIOD <BREAK>
eat it ,COMMA and feel privileged .PERIOD <BREAK>
on the other hand ,COMMA we're working with berkshire hathaway ,COMMA warren buffett and shaw carpet ,COMMA the largest carpet company in the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
and this is in the process of being built as we speak .PERIOD <BREAK>
and they started listening to the marketplace ,COMMA and they came back with ideas for cassava chips ,COMMA and banana chips ,COMMA and sorghum bread ,COMMA and before you knew it ,COMMA we had cornered the kigali market ,COMMA and the women were earning three to four times the national average .PERIOD <BREAK>
why would you buy an mp <NUM> player from a computer company ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
i had a butterfly period ,COMMA a snake period ,COMMA a bird period ,COMMA a fish period ,COMMA a cave period and finally and definitively ,COMMA an ant period .PERIOD <BREAK>
but the real problem is the lack of other infrastructures .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's like the old maxim of you can tell somebody something and show them ,COMMA but if they do it they really learn it .PERIOD <BREAK>
we squashed it ,COMMA we rethought it ,COMMA but mainly we renamed it the heart of school ,COMMA and that changed everything forever .PERIOD <BREAK>
and that's what we use to inject ,COMMA as we start to do our deep dives .PERIOD <BREAK>
they use the upper half of the face ;SEMICOLON the ears are very expressive .PERIOD <BREAK>
after three books on this ,COMMA it got to be a bit much ,COMMA in a way .PERIOD <BREAK>
and by the look of that paunch ,COMMA he hasn't been doing enough yoga .PERIOD <BREAK>
let's see what we can do .PERIOD <BREAK>
for a variety of reasons they're dangerous ,COMMA but we feel that ooi ,COMMA this ocean observatory initiative ,COMMA which the national science foundation has begun to fund ,COMMA has the potential to really transform things .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the reddit community ,COMMA really ,COMMA and the rest of the internet ,COMMA rather ,COMMA really got behind this .PERIOD <BREAK>
and now ,COMMA look ,COMMA ace of diamonds will guide .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA how can we still stay immune ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
yes ,COMMA to be sure ,COMMA science has done much to push back certain types of human suffering .PERIOD <BREAK>
of course ,COMMA remoteness in its normal sense ,COMMA which means that as you go further and further away from an urban center ,COMMA you get to remoter areas .PERIOD <BREAK>
it uses that beautiful distributed foot to make it as if those obstacles are not even there -- truly extraordinary .PERIOD <BREAK>
goldie hawn :COLON thank you .PERIOD choose five ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and that poor country runs off that ledge ,COMMA does that cartoon thing and then drops .PERIOD <BREAK>
suddenly ,COMMA <NUM> dollars for a big mac might be a good deal .PERIOD <BREAK>
now this is doubly ironic when you consider that what gives comedy its edge at reaching around people's walls is the way that it uses deliberate misdirection .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i'm like that's not rubber at all ,COMMA you know .PERIOD <BREAK>
but probably even more important is that the work that comes out of these years flows back into the company and into society at large ,COMMA rather than just benefiting a grandchild or two .PERIOD <BREAK>
the answer to this question ,COMMA i think ,COMMA is an answer you've already heard in some of the talks ,COMMA and i dare say you will hear again :COLON namely ,COMMA that our brains were evolved for a very different world than the one in which we are living .PERIOD <BREAK>
and if you can ,COMMA just scribble a pattern .PERIOD <BREAK>
we retain just <NUM> percent of what we hear .PERIOD <BREAK>
in barcelona i was asked to do a fish ,COMMA and we're working on that ,COMMA at the foot of a ritz-carlton tower being done by skidmore ,COMMA owings and merrill .PERIOD <BREAK>
in fact ,COMMA if you flash them with a camera they catch on fire .PERIOD <BREAK>
i'm taking data from the u .PERIOD n .PERIOD -- it's the same as the world bank has -- on the scale of income differences in these rich developed market democracies .PERIOD <BREAK>
needless to say ,COMMA i was drastically wrong .PERIOD <BREAK>
and as a result ,COMMA they lose their gifts ,COMMA or worse ,COMMA they stop playing altogether .PERIOD <BREAK>
i think we had about <NUM> tutors that worked on this book with them and so this worked out incredibly well .PERIOD <BREAK>
similarly ,COMMA a study in e-content showed that much of global news from u .PERIOD s .PERIOD news creators is recycled stories from the ap wire services and reuters ,COMMA and don't put things into a context that people can understand their connection to it .PERIOD <BREAK>
but we had a philosophy ,COMMA which is it only has to look good for a thousandth of a second .PERIOD <BREAK>
there wasn't any real risk ,COMMA but people were scared .PERIOD <BREAK>
it is very easy to think that networks are necessarily good things -- that being linked from one place to another ,COMMA that being tightly linked in a group ,COMMA is a very good thing .PERIOD <BREAK>
and he asked me how i had made the house for those wasps ,COMMA because he had never seen one this big .PERIOD <BREAK>
i need you to turn that piece of paper over ;SEMICOLON you should find that it’s blank on the other side .PERIOD <BREAK>
but he was setting fiscal policy in that game for high school players who were playing with him .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA again ,COMMA we sort of co-opt our environment to do all these different things .PERIOD <BREAK>
and that feeling hasn't left me yet .PERIOD <BREAK>
and this is an insight that came ,COMMA about two decades ago ,COMMA from a person that i'm very fortunate to work with ,COMMA david kaplan .PERIOD <BREAK>
well ,COMMA this is about state budgets .PERIOD <BREAK>
and let's go to the universe because there's something out there that is more truthful than your mind ,COMMA that is more truthful than your universe .PERIOD <BREAK>
boy :COLON on the day of judgment ,COMMA god will ask me ,COMMA why did you do that ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
well ,COMMA then i got to thinking :COLON this scientific paradigm of mine suggests something different -- and ,COMMA by the way ,COMMA i've now got huge computation capabilities in mathematica ,COMMA and i'm a ceo with some worldly resources to do large ,COMMA seemingly crazy ,COMMA projects -- so i decided to just try to see how much of the systematic knowledge that's out there in the world we could make computable .PERIOD <BREAK>
i'm working on this with the field and space robotics laboratory and my friend steve dubowsky at mit ,COMMA and we have come up with the idea of having little ,COMMA jumping bean-like robots that are propelled by artificial muscle ,COMMA which is one of the dubowsky lab's specialties -- are the epams ,COMMA or artificial muscles .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i love that girl's reaction so much .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it's a lively and a lovely place ,COMMA but we're rapidly changing the oceans with our -- not only with our overfishing ,COMMA our irresponsible fishing ,COMMA our adding of pollutants like fertilizer from our cropland ,COMMA but also ,COMMA most recently ,COMMA with climate change ,COMMA and steve schneider ,COMMA i'm sure ,COMMA will be going into greater detail on this .PERIOD <BREAK>
a heavy weight boxer punches you straight in the face -- <NUM> gs .PERIOD <BREAK>
thirst .PERIOD <BREAK>
and you can see how i'm gradually peeling off .PERIOD <BREAK>
so a high i .PERIOD q .PERIOD <BREAK>
when jerry brown was elected ,COMMA this was the challenge that was put to him .PERIOD <BREAK>
so we went back to mit ,COMMA we took out the instron machine ,COMMA and we figured out what sort of forces did you need in order to compress a briquette to the level that you actually are getting improved performance out of it ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and it's like cleansing yourself so that you can .PERIOD <BREAK>
so you'll see images of this remarkable building .PERIOD <BREAK>
if you look at the blue line ,COMMA the areas with low levels of malaria ,COMMA you can see in those areas ,COMMA actually ,COMMA the number of sexual partners is decreasing a lot as hiv prevalence goes up .PERIOD <BREAK>
philippe is quite erratic ,COMMA so i think that he wouldn't be the best person to design the engine ,COMMA no .PERIOD <BREAK>
were there subpopulations ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
that led to a number of prototypes being built and really experimenting with some ideas .PERIOD <BREAK>
and no matter where i am ,COMMA what's really going on here is that it's an eye-tracking system that tries to locate my eyes .PERIOD <BREAK>
our planet is a good planet because it can keep water .PERIOD <BREAK>
well ,COMMA that would be fine if it was just a secondary preoccupation in life .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA here's my friend paul .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i want to thank you all for having me here today .PERIOD <BREAK>
i better shut up .PERIOD <BREAK>
so here's another example .PERIOD this one's somewhat more somber .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is my mother and aunt teaching donna how to ride a bike .PERIOD <BREAK>
i want to say a word for the soil and the bees and the plants and the animals ,COMMA and tell you about a tool ,COMMA a very simple tool that i have found .PERIOD <BREAK>
and here's another aspect of the sorts of things that chris and i were doing .PERIOD <BREAK>
we've actually tried to turn it into an electrical engineering lab .PERIOD <BREAK>
in the case of the vikings -- in greenland ,COMMA the climate got colder in the late <NUM> s ,COMMA and especially in the <NUM> s .PERIOD but a cold climate isn't necessarily fatal ,COMMA because the inuit -- the eskimos inhabiting greenland at the same time -- did better ,COMMA rather than worse ,COMMA with cold climates .PERIOD so why didn't the greenland norse as well ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
one ,COMMA you can swirl and twirl and gloom and doom forever ,COMMA or two ,COMMA you can grieve and then face the future with newly sober eyes .PERIOD <BREAK>
i'd want one to realize that defense usually wins championships ,COMMA and would work hard on defense .PERIOD <BREAK>
so it's really interesting ,COMMA and it makes sense in a way ,COMMA that they're still young ,COMMA so why would they be getting diseases of aging until their old ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and you crank it several times .PERIOD <BREAK>
over the next few years ,COMMA astronomers connected up their antennas to loudspeakers and learned about our radio sky ,COMMA about jupiter and the sun ,COMMA by listening .PERIOD <BREAK>
our employee turnover dropped to one-third of the industry average ,COMMA and during that five year dotcom bust ,COMMA we tripled in size .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is a nurses' college -- there are <NUM> nurses studying .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the crux of the matter was ,COMMA however ,COMMA getting more from less .PERIOD <BREAK>
it is a document that can mean so many things ,COMMA for iran and for the region .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i say ,COMMA who do you think these men are sleeping with ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
china exports business people ,COMMA nannies ,COMMA students ,COMMA teachers to teach chinese around the region ,COMMA to intermarry and to occupy ever greater commanding heights of the economies .PERIOD <BREAK>
i'm going to add some resource from the left ,COMMA here ,COMMA that defuses into the system ,COMMA and you can see ,COMMA they really like that .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the brain scans were identical in both activities .PERIOD <BREAK>
i think glamour has a genuine appeal ,COMMA has a genuine value .PERIOD <BREAK>
and our values are beginning to unite us .PERIOD <BREAK>
and this is why you need weathermen .PERIOD <BREAK>
you see that south america and africa may be connected in a certain way ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK other people say ,COMMA oh ,COMMA that sounds ridiculous .PERIOD it's simple .PERIOD so ,COMMA what shaped lance ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and well ,COMMA i didn't expect them to even answer my email .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it's in there that those mini-big bangs will be created ,COMMA sometime in the summer this year .PERIOD <BREAK>
but actually ,COMMA there was something quite real in my life that happened when i was about <NUM> .PERIOD <BREAK>
what does that mean ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and often ,COMMA the movie's ,COMMA like ,COMMA there and it's going ,COMMA and then something happens and you go ,COMMA oh-- and then something else ,COMMA and you're ,COMMA mmm .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the only people in there is a bartender and an old man nursing a beer .PERIOD <BREAK>
for example ,COMMA thought-controlled computing can teach children with add how to improve their focus .PERIOD <BREAK>
but in this middle region ,COMMA between <NUM> and <NUM> ,COMMA the death rates in botswana are much ,COMMA much ,COMMA much higher than in egypt .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is a textile mill doing synthetic silk ,COMMA an oil byproduct .PERIOD <BREAK>
one is that we have a really hard time thinking in absolute terms .PERIOD <BREAK>
we have this incredible excess capacity .PERIOD <BREAK>
you get excited by an idea and ,COMMA kapow !EXCLAMATIONMARK <BREAK>
so if you cross the border -- just across the border -- a small factory in germany ,COMMA and here you can see the guy with his computer screen ,COMMA and those points in space are communicated .PERIOD <BREAK>
so that's my story .PERIOD to be continued .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA i am married to the most wonderful woman in the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
then hear this ,COMMA please .PERIOD <BREAK>
just explain .PERIOD give an example of how that could possibly be true .PERIOD <BREAK>
imagine if a team of surgeons could fly into the brain ,COMMA as though it was a world ,COMMA and see tissues as landscapes ,COMMA and hear blood density levels as music .PERIOD <BREAK>
they become consumers and producers and local economies begin to spiral up very rapidly .PERIOD <BREAK>
they don't have roots that go into trunks nor to the forest floor .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA the u .PERIOD n .PERIOD estimated -- this is <NUM> figures -- that there are almost <NUM> million people who can't read and write ,COMMA worldwide .PERIOD <BREAK>
from work or from home ,COMMA they took the day off ,COMMA and nothing worked in iceland .PERIOD <BREAK>
because your body will do most of the work of fixing it if we just sort of prop it up in the ways that are wrong .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is not a dead body .PERIOD this is a body who basically ,COMMA in this particular case ,COMMA feels the force and tries to protect its head .PERIOD <BREAK>
a metamaterial is an artificial material ,COMMA which manipulates ,COMMA in this case ,COMMA electromagnetic radiation ,COMMA in a way that you couldn't otherwise .PERIOD <BREAK>
all these green countries are achieving millennium development goals .PERIOD <BREAK>
i have the why over here ,COMMA and the how over there .PERIOD <BREAK>
he's been in many battles .PERIOD <BREAK>
being human is an art form .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the animal's going to hear a tone -- and a flash of light occurred there .PERIOD <BREAK>
some countries accept that their databases can go out on the world ,COMMA but what we really need is ,COMMA of course ,COMMA a search function .PERIOD <BREAK>
then they use these emotions to dimensionalize the worlds they create .PERIOD <BREAK>
or perhaps in the ecstasy of romantic love .PERIOD <BREAK>
we're terrible at models that span <NUM> years .PERIOD <BREAK>
doesn't everyone want more meaning in their lives ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
all this complexity ,COMMA all the way to these wonderful things -- human brains -- are a property of an old and cold and complicated universe .PERIOD <BREAK>
so if we add in a chimpanzee here ,COMMA we will see more differences .PERIOD <BREAK>
so the physics is that the bigger the mass of an object the more force is needed to change its direction .PERIOD <BREAK>
so the choice of answers were :COLON very good ,COMMA good ,COMMA bad and very bad .PERIOD <BREAK>
but biomimicry means respecting the wisdom of all species .PERIOD <BREAK>
because if copyright law at its core regulates something called copies ,COMMA then in the digital world the one fact we can't escape is that every single use of culture produces a copy .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so the first thought that came to mind is ,COMMA everywhere we park we have electric power .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so indeed ,COMMA there are times when we can find ingredients that [are] bad .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's going to be a cradle-to-cradle scream bag ,COMMA of course .PERIOD <BREAK>
way downstream we have the international criminal court .PERIOD <BREAK>
you might say ,COMMA well ,COMMA maybe things just smoothed themselves out .PERIOD <BREAK>
all works of art are talking to us about things .PERIOD <BREAK>
that gets you about four million dead in central africa over the <NUM> s .PERIOD <BREAK>
but if there's a little tiny civilization of green people walking around down there ,COMMA and you make them small enough ,COMMA and we won't see them either .PERIOD that is true .PERIOD <BREAK>
in fact ,COMMA talk about technology imitating life imitating tech ,COMMA or maybe it's the other way around .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's about a boy who falls in love with a horse .PERIOD <BREAK>
i want to talk a little bit about the democratic republic of congo .PERIOD <BREAK>
so what all of these cases have in common is that the self seems to thin out ,COMMA or melt away ,COMMA and it feels good ,COMMA it feels really good ,COMMA in a way totally unlike anything we feel in our normal lives .PERIOD <BREAK>
in fact ,COMMA south africa has not gone down that road .PERIOD <BREAK>
what i found out is that the tooling ,COMMA if you intervened in the software ,COMMA actually produced decorative effects .PERIOD <BREAK>
now is the time to believe .PERIOD <BREAK>
look at the health systems in so many countries .PERIOD <BREAK>
but it's uh -- let's see if i can manipulate it a little bit without ,COMMA um -- oops .PERIOD <BREAK>
so when you think about it ,COMMA we're almost like a tourist visiting ourselves over there .PERIOD <BREAK>
but where is this going ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
instead ,COMMA what we've seen is something much worse than a revolt .PERIOD <BREAK>
so anyway ,COMMA even if i do not understand science entirely ,COMMA for my design i essentially refer to it .PERIOD <BREAK>
they'll be having two bottles .PERIOD ok ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
this is simply not what our grandest and best institutes of higher learning are in the business of .PERIOD <BREAK>
the sensor is just a little strip of metal in that headband there .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA it's simple .PERIOD all you need are those top quartile teachers .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's totally free -- there's not even ads .PERIOD <BREAK>
i mean ,COMMA there are a few launches you've done where the brand maybe hasn't worked quite as well .PERIOD <BREAK>
and of course ,COMMA the brain adds on a lot of information to what is going on in the signals that come from the retina .PERIOD <BREAK>
dan dennett :COLON see the shadows going back and forth ?QUESTIONMARK pretty big .PERIOD <BREAK>
we all need to love and be loved in life .PERIOD <BREAK>
chapter two starts in <NUM> .PERIOD <BREAK>
now ,COMMA he gets to f-sharp ,COMMA and finally he goes down to e ,COMMA but it's the wrong chord -- because the chord he's looking for is this one ,COMMA and instead he does .PERIOD <BREAK>
and while that swim took place three years ago ,COMMA i can remember it as if it was yesterday .PERIOD <BREAK>
you see ,COMMA the scale of the suffering numbs us into a kind of indifference .PERIOD <BREAK>
every morning ,COMMA again ,COMMA after getting out of that tent your brain is completely wiped out .PERIOD <BREAK>
that is where conventional ideas stop .PERIOD <BREAK>
when the sunlight comes through the window you see these little fibers .PERIOD <BREAK>
here ,COMMA we have a whole bunch of disparate images .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is a plot of frequency against time -- sort of like musical notation ,COMMA where the higher notes are up higher and the lower notes are lower ,COMMA and time goes this way .PERIOD <BREAK>
we taking your car ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
you're not supposed to rip off the shark or the monster .PERIOD <BREAK>
we know almost nothing about it .PERIOD <BREAK>
most of us are familiar with electrons .PERIOD <BREAK>
because in agriculture ,COMMA if you had <NUM> kids and you grow up a little bit earlier and you work a little bit harder ,COMMA you could produce about five times more wealth ,COMMA on average ,COMMA than your neighbor .PERIOD <BREAK>
now this is being augmented with further layers of technology like augmented reality .PERIOD <BREAK>
because my students ,COMMA what they said when they looked upon the world ,COMMA and i asked them ,COMMA what do you really think about the world ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
i was able to morph the culture into a non-sporulating form .PERIOD <BREAK>
coca-cola .PERIOD a bunch of you may be a load of pinkos ,COMMA and you may not like the coca-cola company ,COMMA but it's worth remembering andy warhol's point about coke .PERIOD <BREAK>
do i have a place ,COMMA a venue ,COMMA in mind when i write ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
but if we keep running this for a while ,COMMA we find out that although the pattern we get is very intricate ,COMMA it has a very regular structure .PERIOD <BREAK>
but now here's where the bias comes in .PERIOD <BREAK>
on that self ,COMMA it should be centered -- a bigness ,COMMA a wholeness .PERIOD <BREAK>
back in <NUM> when the movie came out ,COMMA we actually had a grant from the national science foundation to attempt to extract dna from a dinosaur ,COMMA and we chose the dinosaur on the left ,COMMA a tyrannosaurus rex ,COMMA which was a very nice specimen .PERIOD <BREAK>
the next thing i believe is that we need to create technologies for poor farmers to add value to their own crops .PERIOD <BREAK>
the map of port au-prince at the end of <NUM> was not all it could be ,COMMA not as good as the map of california .PERIOD <BREAK>

illegal wildlife trade in brazil is one of the major threats against our fauna ,COMMA especially birds ,COMMA and mainly to supply the pet market with thousands of animals taken from nature every month ,COMMA and transported far from their origins ,COMMA to be sold mainly in rio de janeiro and são paulo .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's exactly the same construction ,COMMA but no muffins ,COMMA no mice ,COMMA nothing moving at all .PERIOD <BREAK>
that was her resistance .PERIOD <BREAK>
a couple years ago ,COMMA i was in south africa on safari .PERIOD <BREAK>
because they don't need to talk to their own citizens .PERIOD <BREAK>
but we have an opportunity .PERIOD <BREAK>
climate change :COLON we're trying to reduce the stress in our personal lives and in our communities and on the planet .PERIOD <BREAK>
but of course ,COMMA you know ,COMMA the reason you're laughing is bad for humans too .PERIOD <BREAK>
and then ,COMMA instead of taking days to disseminate this information to the people who need it most ,COMMA it can happen automatically .PERIOD <BREAK>
here's the scanner going through ,COMMA scanning the wound .PERIOD <BREAK>
and mostly what good dads should be doing this time of year is nestling with their kids and decorating the christmas tree .PERIOD <BREAK>

so of course ,COMMA this is a very crude machine ,COMMA but we're working on a micro-scale version of these ,COMMA and hopefully the cubes will be like a powder that you pour in .PERIOD <BREAK>
what's even more amazing is it will print out a purchase label on the spot ,COMMA because it knows the weight of the item .PERIOD <BREAK>
this takes a second ,COMMA but it's a distinctive stage .PERIOD <BREAK>
and when you look at the news through that filter ,COMMA a lot falls by the wayside .PERIOD <BREAK>
your brain is doing something that computers cannot yet do .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the point of this magazine was to read the articles ,COMMA listen to the music ,COMMA and try to interpret it .PERIOD <BREAK>
i'm an actor who plays a specific part .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's very fashionable to talk about human trafficking ,COMMA in this fantastic a-c hall .PERIOD <BREAK>

and i was thinking ,COMMA we didn't give them support and encouragement ;SEMICOLON they gave it to us .PERIOD <BREAK>
but most things ,COMMA you really have to know what's going on in the kitchen ,COMMA because ,COMMA mostly ,COMMA sick people used to be healthy people -- they have the same genome .PERIOD <BREAK>
why kermit ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
i think it's always been wrong ,COMMA because i think always creativity has been highly collaborative ,COMMA and it's probably been largely interactive .PERIOD <BREAK>
the slowest rowers ,COMMA the weakest rowers ,COMMA are going to get cut from the team .PERIOD <BREAK>
which i found very interesting that it was going full cycle :COLON i was making comments about the press and about how we know facts and information only by media -- because we don't know the real people ;SEMICOLON very few of us know the real people -- but it was going back into the press and they were publicizing ,COMMA effectively ,COMMA my filthy work .PERIOD <BREAK>
they start off on all sorts of goofy projects .PERIOD <BREAK>
and what we've measured is the force as a function of terms .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's because of air quality .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is the original mac operating system .PERIOD <BREAK>
here were have on the left ,COMMA the internet and on the right ,COMMA the root apparatus .PERIOD <BREAK>
transitional is completely different .PERIOD <BREAK>
the other one says ,COMMA fine .PERIOD looks good to me .PERIOD <BREAK>
so it's kind of like if your house catches on fire .PERIOD <BREAK>
we sit here -- you know ,COMMA think about the ground vehicles ,COMMA the human scale -- what do you see in person ?QUESTIONMARK we need to capture that up close to establish that what it's like-type experience .PERIOD <BREAK>
the process requires a huge amount of water ,COMMA which is then pumped into massive toxic tailing ponds .PERIOD <BREAK>
which leads us to conclude american businesses fail faster than americans ,COMMA and therefore american businesses are evolving faster than americans .PERIOD <BREAK>
i have no idea how it works ,COMMA but i paid a lot of money for it .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's kind of ridiculous ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and it's fair to say that in these <NUM> years ,COMMA we've witnessed absolutely the start of a scientific revolution -- that of genome medicine .PERIOD <BREAK>
right ?QUESTIONMARK it's a fun word to say ,COMMA and i get to say it a lot .PERIOD <BREAK>
how are we going to perform our social and political reform to keep pace with economic growth ,COMMA to keep sustainability and stability ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
a three-digit number ,COMMA sir ,COMMA yes ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
so one of the big bellwethers ,COMMA and one of my final points i want to mention ,COMMA is the interesting thing i read is that cnbc has launched their first african channel .PERIOD why is cnbc doing this ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
it lays the world at your feet and says ,COMMA you can have anything ,COMMA everything .PERIOD <BREAK>
so i just really encourage you ,COMMA whatever your stake is in education -- whether you're a student ,COMMA parent ,COMMA teacher ,COMMA policy maker ,COMMA whatever -- insist on better math curriculum .PERIOD <BREAK>
but when i got into this magazine ,COMMA there's something kind of disturbing ,COMMA and this continued .PERIOD <BREAK>
so that's why i've always been fascinated with how technology could actually reshape and open up authoritarian societies like ours .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it's an intellectual challenge to understand how we do that .PERIOD <BREAK>
in terms of dark matter ,COMMA i said that we don't have any ,COMMA you know ,COMMA really persuasive argument for dark energy .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA as you all know ,COMMA species lived in particular ecological niches and particular environments ,COMMA and the pressures of those environments selected which changes ,COMMA through random mutation in species ,COMMA were going to be preserved .PERIOD <BREAK>
so if you affix some wires and switches to those tiles -- rather than to the staple strands ,COMMA you affix them to the tiles -- then they'll self-assemble the somewhat complicated circuits ,COMMA the demultiplexer circuits ,COMMA that you need to address this memory .PERIOD <BREAK>

and at one point -- and i had some wine ,COMMA i have to admit that -- at one point i said ,COMMA if there was a contest ,COMMA i would join .PERIOD <BREAK>
so the very definition -- to say invest in africa is a no-go .PERIOD <BREAK>
and stop with the labels ,COMMA the limiting .PERIOD <BREAK>

they asked me to open their <NUM> th anniversary show in <NUM> .PERIOD <BREAK>

this is the first time that i can remember ,COMMA where if you get a letter from the bank manager about a loan ,COMMA you don't know if you're borrowing money from him ,COMMA or if he's borrowing money from you .PERIOD <BREAK>
when people don't take their pills ,COMMA when people don't follow doctors' orders -- these are behavior problems .PERIOD <BREAK>
that's another great idea .PERIOD <BREAK>
people that have partnered with us have given us new eyes ,COMMA not only on what exists -- the new landscapes at the bottom of the sea -- but also how we think about life on the planet itself .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i had to say ,COMMA because it represents human creativity ,COMMA the creativity that allowed us ,COMMA that we were required to have to conceive and build and launch the space shuttle ,COMMA springs from the same source as the imagination and analysis it took to carve a bundu statue ,COMMA or the ingenuity it took to design ,COMMA choreograph ,COMMA and stage cry .PERIOD <BREAK>
and more and more people get involved in this ,COMMA most of whom we've never met .PERIOD <BREAK>
but also here is another idea we have -- is an intercollegiate exchange program where you have students going from new york abroad .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's very ,COMMA very different .PERIOD and it's a memory of these very high-dimensional patterns ,COMMA like the things that come from your eyes .PERIOD <BREAK>
man :COLON yes ,COMMA well ,COMMA first ,COMMA you know ,COMMA i'm part of news corporation as part of fox entertainment group .PERIOD <BREAK>
he was out there in parol delivering a baby .PERIOD <BREAK>

you know ,COMMA so much was worked out :COLON the first real-time interaction ,COMMA the video display ,COMMA pointing a gun .PERIOD it lead to the microcomputer ,COMMA but unfortunately ,COMMA it was too pricey for the navy ,COMMA and all of this would have been lost if it weren't for a happy coincidence .PERIOD <BREAK>
i say we absolutely are irresponsible if we stay silent on this .PERIOD <BREAK>
but -- and this is the dark lining -- it is threatened by -- in the same way that it threatens -- the incumbent industrial systems .PERIOD <BREAK>
past the pyramid of cestius -- these will seem very familiar to you ,COMMA even if you haven't been to rome recently -- past the gatehouse .PERIOD <BREAK>
we start with sherman in a chinese restaurant ,COMMA who gets a fortune that he's about to get caught by a trawler ,COMMA which he does .PERIOD <BREAK>
man :COLON oh !EXCLAMATIONMARK dad is louis farrakhan ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
issuing an insurance policy against abduction by aliens seems a pretty safe bet .PERIOD <BREAK>
what we'd like to do is start understanding the interaction between these patterns and the language that my son is exposed to to see if we can predict how the structure of when words are heard affects when they're learned -- so in other words ,COMMA the relationship between words and what they're about in the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
anywhere you go in the sahel ,COMMA you'll see this windscreen .PERIOD <BREAK>
because there's a lot of old people still living that play that old style .PERIOD <BREAK>
that's on the champs-elysees .PERIOD <BREAK>

there's only been two concepts tried -- two by the u .PERIOD s .PERIOD and one by the russians .PERIOD <BREAK>

and we wanted to make sure that we did something that would work for a music video .PERIOD <BREAK>
a sorcerer's profit on wall street ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
now ,COMMA there are a few places -- very few -- where great teachers are being made .PERIOD <BREAK>
there are plenty of downsides .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's not about decoration .PERIOD <BREAK>

so ,COMMA should we rather ask ,COMMA can anything save newspapers ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
this little thingamajig :COLON we didn't know this thingamajig existed .PERIOD <BREAK>

billions of events have occurred in your history that are related in time to yourself as the receiver ,COMMA or yourself as the actor ,COMMA yourself as the thinker ,COMMA yourself as the mover .PERIOD <BREAK>
i beat out all the ph .PERIOD d .PERIOD 's because i figured that if you treat children like human beings ,COMMA it increases the likelihood they're going to behave that way .PERIOD <BREAK>
so we go ,COMMA sit ,COMMA on the couch ;SEMICOLON sit ,COMMA tummy-rub ;SEMICOLON sit ,COMMA look ,COMMA i throw a tennis ball ;SEMICOLON sit ,COMMA say hello to that other dog .PERIOD <BREAK>
so after we do that ,COMMA we put it into a vacuum bag ,COMMA add a little bit of seaweed ,COMMA some spices ,COMMA and we roll it ,COMMA and this starts taking on the appearance of tuna .PERIOD <BREAK>
now ,COMMA when kids get to be in third or fourth grade ,COMMA you might see that this kid's going to be a visual thinker ,COMMA drawing in perspective .PERIOD now ,COMMA i want to emphasize that not every autistic kid is going to be a visual thinker .PERIOD <BREAK>

this is the work of kacey marra from pittsburgh ,COMMA along with a number of colleagues around the world .PERIOD <BREAK>

and this is a great example of how we haven't learned that lesson at all .PERIOD <BREAK>
so the little poem is called the dead .PERIOD <BREAK>
sounds like a conservative climate plan .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i think ,COMMA i truly believe ,COMMA that we can change this thing one laugh at a time .PERIOD <BREAK>
you think ,COMMA bend elbow ,COMMA a different section contracts .PERIOD <BREAK>

they don't spend time alone .PERIOD <BREAK>
it turns out that we can measure different forms of happiness .PERIOD <BREAK>

i think the first one is that they got fooled by history .PERIOD <BREAK>
we should take our foot off the pedal right now ,COMMA and generally we do .PERIOD these things are shown to be pretty effective in terms of getting people to slow down .PERIOD <BREAK>
that's kind of the level at which it is .PERIOD <BREAK>
and then ,COMMA stage nine .PERIOD <BREAK>
and if you see those metal bits there -- those are huge magnets that bend electrically charged particles ,COMMA so it can measure how fast they're traveling .PERIOD <BREAK>
these are called motor command neurons that have been known for a long time .PERIOD <BREAK>
if any child is found violating these rules ,COMMA he is severely reprimanded .PERIOD <BREAK>
but it is a politics of principle ,COMMA not of partisanship .PERIOD <BREAK>
and we need to think very dispassionately about the comparative advantages of small-scale and large-scale .PERIOD <BREAK>
i'm not able to follow a line of text in a book .PERIOD <BREAK>
we asked that to a junkie and they're like ,COMMA are you nuts ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>

it's like a rodeo show .PERIOD they all get a ride on the machine ,COMMA and they get rewarded for how fast or how far they can make the machine move forward .PERIOD <BREAK>

they're not going to die of hypothermia .PERIOD <BREAK>
we've done films .PERIOD we've done books .PERIOD we have more coming .PERIOD <BREAK>
mid-sized company in the midwest ,COMMA blue collar employees struggling to pay their bills repeatedly told us they cannot save more right away .PERIOD <BREAK>

this is about <NUM> -- peak of the crack epidemic .PERIOD <BREAK>
that invariably ,COMMA the world was a different place when i would introduce a technology .PERIOD <BREAK>
whereas with saving three percent ,COMMA people might have to add nice sneakers so they can walk ,COMMA because they won't be able to afford anything else ,COMMA when they save <NUM> percent they might be able to maybe have nice dress shoes to walk to the car to drive .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA it opens up more questions than it answers ,COMMA i'm afraid ,COMMA but that's what ,COMMA you know ,COMMA science is really good at .PERIOD <BREAK>
we have these technologies .PERIOD we use them .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's because when you live on four dollars a day ,COMMA you're living on survival and you have to be sustainable .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's gone now .PERIOD <BREAK>
and over the years ,COMMA around the turn of the <NUM> th century ,COMMA it started to take on this other kind of deception -- this definition for any artificial interest in ,COMMA or association with ,COMMA an object through which it appears delusively magnified or glorified .PERIOD <BREAK>
thank you very much .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the question is whether the short run will persist .PERIOD <BREAK>
but anyway ,COMMA these kinds of projects that are trying to reconnect us with nature is extremely important .PERIOD <BREAK>
how often do you get to participate in a big scientific project ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>

in biology ,COMMA carbon takes center stage .PERIOD <BREAK>
but they didn't believe me .PERIOD <BREAK>
none of them are tricks .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so the idea of a curriculum is completely irrelevant in a setting like this .PERIOD <BREAK>
a recent study at penn state university found that when you smile ,COMMA you don't only appear to be more likable and courteous ,COMMA but you actually appear to be more competent .PERIOD <BREAK>
so for example ,COMMA lets sort of consider that basket cell i told you about earlier -- the one that's atrophied in schizophrenia and the one that is inhibitory .PERIOD <BREAK>

i interrupted ,COMMA and i said ,COMMA did you say this ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
we see the result ,COMMA the traces ,COMMA if you like ,COMMA of the bacillus pasteurii being harnessed to sculpt the desert into these habitable environments .PERIOD <BREAK>

here is the thing .PERIOD <BREAK>
somehow ,COMMA what we need to do is step back from those situations ,COMMA like that wise old woman ,COMMA look at the situation through fresh eyes and come up with an <NUM> th camel .PERIOD <BREAK>
these lichens grow only one centimeter every hundred years .PERIOD <BREAK>
he was laid to rest in the ganges river ,COMMA where the dead are cremated along the banks of the river or tied to heavy stones and sunk in the water .PERIOD <BREAK>

they're about where you live ,COMMA how many people you live with ,COMMA and whether you own your home or not .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i'm doing her because i think we think of risk ,COMMA at a conference like this ,COMMA as a good thing .PERIOD <BREAK>
and you're on the inside ,COMMA and it's everything you hoped it would be .PERIOD <BREAK>
but america lost .PERIOD we lost .PERIOD and because of that ,COMMA we made a big jump to recover it .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so we need both the market and we need aid .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i personally am obsessed with morality .PERIOD <BREAK>
in fact ,COMMA high school athletes are three times more likely to sustain catastrophic injuries relative even to their college-age peers ,COMMA and it takes them longer to return to a symptom-free baseline .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so i said ,COMMA you know what ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>

the old shyness was a fear of rejection .PERIOD <BREAK>
so looking at their three main markets for their product which were basically transportation design ,COMMA interiors and furniture ,COMMA we came up with the solution of taking an old airstream trailer and gutting it ,COMMA and trying to portray laminate ,COMMA and a trailer ,COMMA in kind of a fresh ,COMMA new contemporary look .PERIOD <BREAK>
then it deserves protection .PERIOD <BREAK>
since every scientist in the world now believes this ,COMMA and even president bush has seen the light ,COMMA or pretends to ,COMMA we can take this is a given .PERIOD <BREAK>
but the cool thing about running ,COMMA as i've discovered ,COMMA is that something bizarre happens in this activity all the time .PERIOD <BREAK>
we've also been working in design .PERIOD <BREAK>
votes can't go missing because then you won't find yours when you look for it .PERIOD <BREAK>

so why do we talk about the norden bombsight ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
but it was she who ended up learning all the arabic words for the local plants ,COMMA as well as their uses -- medicinal uses ,COMMA cosmetics ,COMMA cooking ,COMMA herbal .PERIOD <BREAK>
so <NUM> dollars per video hour ,COMMA and also about <NUM> dollars to <NUM> dollars per celluloid hour ,COMMA we're able to go and get materials online very inexpensively and have them up on the net .PERIOD <BREAK>
so the impact of all this has been essentially one of growing the market ,COMMA because it focused on the non-customer ,COMMA and then by reaching the unreached ,COMMA we're able to significantly grow the market .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's around <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> ,COMMA and it's called the sagole baobab .PERIOD <BREAK>
this continued attention -- this ongoing attention -- is a really big deal to build different kinds of relationships among us .PERIOD <BREAK>
so i created the place samboja lestari ,COMMA and the idea was ,COMMA if i can do this on the worst possible place that i can think of where there is really nothing left ,COMMA no one will have an excuse to say ,COMMA yeah ,COMMA but .PERIOD <BREAK>
all i have to do is sit ,COMMA and they do everything .PERIOD <BREAK>
and someone stood up to say that one of the frustrating things is that it's been a simplistic debate .PERIOD <BREAK>
this kind of a sequence is said to have a very low entropy because there's no variation at all .PERIOD <BREAK>
many years ago ,COMMA when i was born in the ' <NUM> s -- ' <NUM> s and ' <NUM> s didn't belong to girls in india .PERIOD <BREAK>
school dropout rate is up to <NUM> percent .PERIOD <BREAK>
now ,COMMA if life had originated on europa in the ocean ,COMMA it could also have moved out onto the surface .PERIOD <BREAK>
take it out of this room .PERIOD <BREAK>
no ,COMMA no reason why it really can't happen in every classroom in america tomorrow .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's about our beliefs and expectations .PERIOD <BREAK>
in <NUM> ,COMMA i pushed all the theories that i had on story at the time to the limits of my understanding on this project .PERIOD <BREAK>
if it is the case ,COMMA ladies and gentlemen -- and it is -- that we are now locked together in a way that has never been quite the same before ,COMMA then it's also the case that we share a destiny with each other .PERIOD <BREAK>
allow a new city to be built up there .PERIOD <BREAK>
finally ,COMMA i think they are infinitely interesting and valuable ,COMMA for giving one some insight as to how the brain works .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i was pulling a molecule out of this bag .PERIOD <BREAK>
it will cause one to get created on the other side .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it's a new technology coming in ,COMMA but then amazingly ,COMMA how well it fits to the economy of the countries .PERIOD that's why the <NUM> dollar computer will be so important .PERIOD but it's a nice tendency .PERIOD <BREAK>
so we have a model ,COMMA and we can calculate it ,COMMA and we can use it to make designs of what we think the universe really looks like .PERIOD <BREAK>
so if one looks at the statements that have been made about this ,COMMA i am impressed that when hillary clinton described the foreign policy of the obama administration ,COMMA she said that the foreign policy of the obama administration was going to be smart power ,COMMA as she put it ,COMMA using all the tools in our foreign policy tool box .PERIOD <BREAK>
i think of the great indian mathematician ,COMMA ramanujan .PERIOD <BREAK>
first ,COMMA starting with a push from the right .PERIOD <BREAK>
being a shy ,COMMA little ,COMMA skinny asian kid growing up in the silicon valley with low self-esteem ,COMMA those guys made me believe in something bigger .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's a tough job ,COMMA isn't it ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
did you land on the rim ,COMMA down at the bottom ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and in this community ,COMMA we didn't have a television ;SEMICOLON we didn't have computers ,COMMA obviously ,COMMA radio .PERIOD <BREAK>
i think -- how can this possibly be ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
suddenly dozens of gharial appearing on the river ,COMMA dead .PERIOD <BREAK>
bear in mind there are two things about this .PERIOD <BREAK>
and here ,COMMA if we look at a detail of the way that the building opens up and breathes into those atria ,COMMA the way in which now ,COMMA with a computer ,COMMA we can model the forces ,COMMA we can see the high pressure ,COMMA the low pressure ,COMMA the way in which the building behaves rather like an aircraft wing .PERIOD <BREAK>
now ,COMMA you can see the odds of winning haven't changed ,COMMA but it's now fantastically easy to imagine who's going to win .PERIOD <BREAK>
non-theist will do for all that ,COMMA yet unlike atheist ,COMMA it doesn't have the same phobic ,COMMA hysterical responses .PERIOD <BREAK>
i couldn't build this the way i knew because hand-tied knots weren't going to withstand a hurricane .PERIOD <BREAK>
rapid manufacturing is a computer file sent directly from the computer to the manufacturing machine .PERIOD <BREAK>
now everyone would expect that when the degradation of the oil happens ,COMMA when the constituents are liberated ,COMMA they disappear ,COMMA they go away because they [were] absorbed .PERIOD <BREAK>
so when her colleague said ,COMMA what does he do ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
we're seeing an entente cordiale between science and religion that five years ago i would not have believed ,COMMA as the evangelical community has understood the desperate situation of global warming .PERIOD <BREAK>
gender balanced much more ,COMMA older ,COMMA educated ,COMMA married with children .PERIOD <BREAK>
you may have the chance to make a difference .PERIOD <BREAK>
thank you .PERIOD <BREAK>
it means we need to be doing more prevention the more treatment we have .PERIOD <BREAK>
and what he did in response ,COMMA is he went on regis and kelly ,COMMA and broke his old record .PERIOD <BREAK>
although ,COMMA the change in your mind already does something for other beings :COLON they can sense this new quality in yourself ,COMMA and it helps them already ,COMMA and gives them an example .PERIOD <BREAK>
alicia ,COMMA in her own right ,COMMA very famous .PERIOD <BREAK>
so i started teaching a class ,COMMA modestly called ,COMMA how to make almost anything .PERIOD and that wasn't meant to be provocative ;SEMICOLON it was just for a few research students .PERIOD <BREAK>
so what i wanted to argue is ,COMMA books are within our grasp .PERIOD <BREAK>
you get a divergence of newtonian and quantum thinking at that point ,COMMA you have a split in your dialog that is so deep ,COMMA and so far ,COMMA that they cannot bring this together at all .PERIOD <BREAK>
the people in those camps are surrounded on all sides by so-called janjaweed ,COMMA these men on horseback with spears and kalashnikovs .PERIOD <BREAK>
if i can repeat anything ,COMMA i have the possibility of a pattern from hickory nuts and chicken eggs ,COMMA shards of glass ,COMMA branches .PERIOD <BREAK>
and then we decided ,COMMA why not get to religion because in the philippines ,COMMA the catholic church was pretty strong ,COMMA and thai people were buddhist .PERIOD <BREAK>
we can get some things out on the internet .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is the connectome of the worm c .PERIOD elegans .PERIOD <BREAK>
i yelled out because when i got closer ,COMMA i found the detail wasn't there at all .PERIOD <BREAK>
that may be a good thing ,COMMA in light of some of the criticisms we've heard today -- for example ,COMMA in the regulatory context -- of what democracy produces .PERIOD <BREAK>
now ,COMMA that's a logical error .PERIOD <BREAK>
shoulder to shoulder ,COMMA night after night ,COMMA we hoarded and sold her -- our lady in white .PERIOD <BREAK>
the challenge ,COMMA though ,COMMA for a wholegrain baker is ,COMMA you know ,COMMA how do you make it taste good ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and the risks stay high throughout the decade .PERIOD <BREAK>
when somebody comes to me and ask for what i am known ,COMMA i mean ,COMMA yes ,COMMA lemon squeezer ,COMMA toilet brush ,COMMA toothpick ,COMMA beautiful toilet seats ,COMMA and why not -- a toothbrush ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
no ,COMMA no ,COMMA no ,COMMA the next one is actually blue ,COMMA to your left ,COMMA and says heathrow express .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is a fiber optic cable that was laid between those two cities to just be able to traffic one signal <NUM> times faster than you can click a mouse -- just for these algorithms ,COMMA just for the carnival and the knife .PERIOD <BREAK>
the magnetic works are a combination of gravity and magnetism ,COMMA so it's a kind of mixture of these ambient forces that influence everything .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's very unsettling .PERIOD <BREAK>
so we need new policies ,COMMA we need -- where's that coming from ,COMMA you know ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
people find that strange ,COMMA but i think it was a great blessing for us .PERIOD <BREAK>
as media head into this new era ,COMMA we are looking for mutations that are durable ,COMMA that have some sort of staying power .PERIOD <BREAK>
so no matter that i have inhibitions to fill all my pockets ,COMMA i keep trying ,COMMA hoping that one day i'll write a poem i can be proud to let sit in a museum exhibit as the only proof i existed .PERIOD <BREAK>
you know ,COMMA there's two ways you can make a product .PERIOD <BREAK>
so you see us here cutting up some watermelon .PERIOD the idea with this is that we're going to eliminate tons of food miles ,COMMA wasted energy ,COMMA and overfishing of tuna by creating tuna ,COMMA or any exotic produce or item from a very far-away place ,COMMA with local ,COMMA organic produce ;SEMICOLON so we have a watermelon from wisconsin .PERIOD <BREAK>
i found this passion not far from here ,COMMA actually ,COMMA when i was nine years old .PERIOD <BREAK>
no ,COMMA the success will come if enough people are motivated to do exactly the same in their daily life ,COMMA save energy ,COMMA go to renewables .PERIOD <BREAK>
anyone on our panel ,COMMA verify the answer .PERIOD <BREAK>
how do you create the sense of transcendence ,COMMA the sense of evoking a perfect world ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
the effect is just electric .PERIOD <BREAK>
sure enough ,COMMA their tools were more complicated than those of homo erectus ,COMMA but they too showed very little change over the <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> years or so that those species ,COMMA the neanderthals ,COMMA lived in eurasia .PERIOD <BREAK>
design ,COMMA the art of organizing the world of things .PERIOD <BREAK>
we want them to actually get involved in the issues .PERIOD <BREAK>
the one way in which they differ :COLON they're extremely social .PERIOD <BREAK>
and you tend to find topics that are almost entirely african-american conversations .PERIOD <BREAK>
and you learn great things about these places .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i looked at it ,COMMA just said ,COMMA yuck ,COMMA and go and work on the other side of the island .PERIOD <BREAK>
my own interest in this subject ,COMMA and my passion for it ,COMMA began rather accidentally .PERIOD <BREAK>
have fun .PERIOD thank you .PERIOD <BREAK>
and on part of that field campaign we even brought an aircraft with us .PERIOD <BREAK>
we can save the white shark .PERIOD <BREAK>
and second of all ,COMMA his data was grainy and fuzzy ,COMMA and he couldn't quite make out what it was he was looking at .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the plastic heads ,COMMA sometimes you want to project them .PERIOD <BREAK>
it was my doctor in cleveland ,COMMA marie budev .PERIOD <BREAK>
you know ,COMMA i was a very young journalist activist at an early age .PERIOD <BREAK>
i think part of the education variable we talked about before is the networking experience you get when you go to college where you do get a mix of people that you might not interact with otherwise .PERIOD <BREAK>
they are domestics .PERIOD <BREAK>
sheriff one-six ,COMMA or any one-four elements ,COMMA we need you at the gate of taji right now ,COMMA over .PERIOD <BREAK>
passive tolerance to evil through inaction or indifference .PERIOD <BREAK>
remember that children's book where you shake and the sexuality of the parents change ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and it's all captured by the video camera running in the front of the police car .PERIOD <BREAK>
what i do with my kids now -- i've got two ,COMMA nine and seven -- is i teach them to walk around the house and the yard ,COMMA looking for stuff that needs to get done .PERIOD <BREAK>
now ,COMMA einstein does say it best when we ask her .PERIOD <BREAK>
so beautiful .PERIOD what a theory .PERIOD <BREAK>
mr .PERIOD gelehun ,COMMA i’d like to remind you you’re not on trial here for any crimes you committed .PERIOD <BREAK>
taken from their families ,COMMA sequestered in a shadowy world of darkness for <NUM> years -- two nine-year periods deliberately chosen to evoke the nine months they spend in the natural mother's womb .PERIOD <BREAK>
they built a high-explosive propelled model .PERIOD <BREAK>
from the zen master seng-ts'an :COLON if you want the truth to stand clear before you ,COMMA never be for or against .PERIOD <BREAK>
interviewer :COLON it's actually quite difficult to walk .PERIOD <BREAK>
the problem bmw faces is this car looks safe .PERIOD <BREAK>
and kosovo became independent .PERIOD <BREAK>
and again ,COMMA it's fully interactive ,COMMA so you can rotate and you can look at things in real time on these systems here .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA if we knew exactly what the extra dimensions look like -- we don't yet ,COMMA but if we did -- we should be able to calculate the allowed notes ,COMMA the allowed vibrational patterns .PERIOD <BREAK>
i remember asking a nine-year-old boy ,COMMA i asked a nine-year-old boy ,COMMA what would life be like for you ,COMMA if you didn't have to adhere to this man box ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
so many people are there .PERIOD <BREAK>
you'll see also ,COMMA there's a flag on antarctica .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA in writing for children ,COMMA it seems simple ,COMMA and it is .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the conclusion of that is that psychology and psychiatry ,COMMA over the last <NUM> years ,COMMA can actually claim that we can make miserable people less miserable .PERIOD <BREAK>
but let me get rid of the slide ,COMMA and let's see if this comes on .PERIOD <BREAK>
these days an ipod classic can hold <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> songs ,COMMA which is to say eight billion dollars-worth of stolen media .PERIOD <BREAK>
and what does the big black hole do ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
we've forgotten that second part .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is the site .PERIOD <BREAK>
i really appreciated that .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so they can do a simulation like this .PERIOD <BREAK>
certainly ,COMMA there were molecules present on the early earth ,COMMA but they wouldn't have been these pure compounds that we worked with in the lab and i showed in these experiments .PERIOD <BREAK>
in fact ,COMMA she indicated that if we would do that ,COMMA not only would we have the joy of receiving the gratitude from the members of the extended family ,COMMA but she said ,COMMA even god will smile ,COMMA and when god smiles ,COMMA there is peace ,COMMA and justice ,COMMA and joy .PERIOD <BREAK>
you learn ,COMMA oh ,COMMA it's a message ,COMMA you know .PERIOD <BREAK>
so our publication rate over the past few months has been sort of minimized while we're re-engineering our back systems for the phenomenal public interest that we have .PERIOD <BREAK>
in other words ,COMMA it's kind of random ,COMMA kind of ad hoc ,COMMA how we figure out what we should do .PERIOD <BREAK>
so here you have a generation of young women who grow up thinking of themselves as being more powerful earners than the young men around them .PERIOD <BREAK>
so in origami ,COMMA to obey these laws ,COMMA we can take simple patterns -- like this repeating pattern of folds ,COMMA called textures -- and by itself it's nothing .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is the same procedure ,COMMA but now done minimally invasively ,COMMA with only three holes in the body where they're taking the heart and simply injecting stem cells through a laparoscopic procedure .PERIOD <BREAK>
completely opposite of the way you'd see it on a nature film ,COMMA of course .PERIOD <BREAK>
thankfully ,COMMA i met reda girgis ,COMMA who is dry as toast ,COMMA but he and his team at johns hopkins didn't just want me to survive ,COMMA they wanted me to live a meaningful life .PERIOD <BREAK>
and that really describes information technology .PERIOD <BREAK>
and one of the reasons they do that is that they turn users into producers ,COMMA consumers into designers .PERIOD <BREAK>
i'm not going to talk about the skeptical environmentalist -- probably that's also a good choice .PERIOD <BREAK>
i was a noticeable nobody .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i say ,COMMA cate ,COMMA what do you want to do ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and it's a pretty interesting scene .PERIOD <BREAK>
the weather station's pretty interesting .PERIOD <BREAK>
any portion around the theater actually can be opened discretely .PERIOD <BREAK>
and here comes biology -- biology ,COMMA with its basic question ,COMMA which still stands unanswered ,COMMA which is essentially :COLON if there is life on other planets ,COMMA do we expect it to be like life on earth ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
it saw that invention could actually benefit from emergencies .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i think that's a good question .PERIOD <BREAK>
february <NUM> -- in one day we laid off <NUM> people ,COMMA and before the bloodshed was finished ,COMMA <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> people had lost their jobs from my companies .PERIOD i felt sick .PERIOD <BREAK>
i mean ,COMMA just to put it in perspective ,COMMA <NUM> degrees is the temperature of a normal indoor swimming pool .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's next to nothing .PERIOD especially designed for me .PERIOD <BREAK>
and doing that in the u .PERIOD s .PERIOD <BREAK>
i'll try to spin a story about energy ,COMMA and oil's a convenient starting place .PERIOD <BREAK>
and basically our problem is somebody's in the middle of this very long stage ,COMMA they pause for just a moment ,COMMA and they leave something in an enzyme for a second ,COMMA and all of a sudden all the measurements from then on don't work .PERIOD <BREAK>
now ,COMMA a six-mile-wide rock is very large .PERIOD <BREAK>
but there is one other reason why india fell in love with cricket ,COMMA which was ,COMMA all you needed was a plank of wood and a rubber ball ,COMMA and any number of people could play it anywhere .PERIOD <BREAK>
if there's time at the end ,COMMA i'll show you the much more dramatic case .PERIOD <BREAK>
now ,COMMA i don't know how many of you have ever done that with your kids ,COMMA but if you do ,COMMA please trust me ,COMMA it's the most pressure you can put on a child ,COMMA to say -- -- we trust you that you will always do the right thing .PERIOD <BREAK>
now some of the greatest composers ,COMMA like bach ,COMMA were combinations of these two things .PERIOD <BREAK>
so i just wanted you to look at this .PERIOD <BREAK>
now ,COMMA these are arm wrestle questions ,COMMA but i want to tell you about questions that are more related to empathy and that really ,COMMA very often ,COMMA are the questions that people have been waiting their whole lives to be asked .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i then became a deprogrammer .PERIOD <BREAK>
and at that time two years ago i mentioned that we were speculating that these jets might in fact be geysers ,COMMA and erupting from pockets or chambers of liquid water underneath the surface ,COMMA but we weren't really sure .PERIOD <BREAK>
those times ,COMMA there were some early attempts also for light therapy already .PERIOD <BREAK>
the other day i was in kerala ,COMMA my home state ,COMMA at the country farm of a friend ,COMMA about <NUM> kilometers away from any place you'd consider urban .PERIOD <BREAK>
i was born in algeria .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is what it looks like ,COMMA essentially ,COMMA this credit and debt system ,COMMA just for the u .PERIOD k .PERIOD <BREAK>
agnes was a woman who was cut when she was a little girl ,COMMA she was female genitally mutilated .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i sliced the little splinters of wood with a broken shard of glass ,COMMA constructed this little apartment .PERIOD <BREAK>
so all the way around ,COMMA you have a <NUM> -hour timeline .PERIOD <BREAK>
we are very happy to have the possibility to be with you in the other side of the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
but if you could put a pin in most cities ,COMMA and imagine how far you could ,COMMA if you had the time ,COMMA walk in one half-hour ,COMMA it's the city .PERIOD <BREAK>
you know more than benki knew when he left his forest and went <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> miles .PERIOD <BREAK>
and secondly ,COMMA he says ,COMMA you must never be afraid to rock the boat .PERIOD <BREAK>
she went to high school .PERIOD <BREAK>
you can see that in health and education ,COMMA a large part of the world population is putting forward ,COMMA but in africa ,COMMA and other parts ,COMMA as in rural guizhou in china ,COMMA there is still people with low health and very low economy .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's visual .PERIOD it's musical .PERIOD it's sensorial .PERIOD <BREAK>
and like children ,COMMA they believe that we are in severe need of assistance .PERIOD <BREAK>
what can we do in a case like chandler's ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and yet ,COMMA there is so much more that needs to be done .PERIOD <BREAK>
i'm going to do that in two steps .PERIOD <BREAK>
and as it became cheaper ,COMMA bread manufacturers decided to add in all kinds of things .PERIOD <BREAK>
now ,COMMA these ideas should apply across the board ,COMMA as long as you can figure out why some organisms evolved to virulence .PERIOD <BREAK>
they were caught by the american soldiers ,COMMA trying to kill americans .PERIOD <BREAK>
the reasons for this have a lot to with the dominance of the two big demographic groups right now :COLON the baby boomers retiring -- and then there's a gap ,COMMA generation x ,COMMA which is a small generation .PERIOD <BREAK>
is nothing sacred anymore ,COMMA for heaven's sake ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
she loved this .PERIOD i got the abc's -- this is where i started my career as a professor ,COMMA when my mother had time to read for me .PERIOD <BREAK>
in india ,COMMA they've got another couple bookmobiles running around .PERIOD <BREAK>
no .PERIOD it's not that it didn't work .PERIOD <BREAK>
why ?QUESTIONMARK because the experience happens inside of us .PERIOD <BREAK>
the people who create these games are smart .PERIOD <BREAK>
yeah .PERIOD the artist doesn't really seem to know where to put the different colors .PERIOD <BREAK>
so good luck .PERIOD we're all in this with you .PERIOD <BREAK>
in so doing ,COMMA i reached a frontier of biology so strange ,COMMA so rich ,COMMA that it seemed as though it exists on another planet .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA what it says to me then is that it's not really -- the problem isn't really the stories that are being told or which stories are being told ,COMMA the problem really is the terms of humanity that we're willing to bring to complicate every story ,COMMA and that's really what it's all about .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA let's take a look now at how we might use the computer for some of this .PERIOD <BREAK>
we drive up the street here ,COMMA we find a family here which earns about two to three dollars a day .PERIOD <BREAK>
and if we can do that ,COMMA the sequence of the neurons we recover from that unscrambling will be a prediction of the pattern of neural activity that is replayed in the brain during memory recall .PERIOD <BREAK>
she does that through important visual forms of photography and film .PERIOD <BREAK>
there's a water jet that cleans you .PERIOD <BREAK>
i don't mean they can't or they're not allowed to ,COMMA they just often choose not to .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is the difference between dating and marriage ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
most people fall in between ,COMMA and if we can work out where they fall we can work out how to negotiate with them to change their behavior .PERIOD <BREAK>
my base of operations is in the u .PERIOD s .PERIOD but let's start at the other end of the map ,COMMA in kyoto ,COMMA japan ,COMMA where i was living with a japanese family while i was doing part of my dissertational research <NUM> years ago .PERIOD <BREAK>
but each of these three objects has value above and beyond what it can do for you based on its history .PERIOD <BREAK>
well ,COMMA i think it has all sorts of profound implications .PERIOD <BREAK>
i get the meat sweats .PERIOD <BREAK>
you can adjust the time scale .PERIOD you can adjust the symptoms .PERIOD <BREAK>
that gives us ,COMMA it turns out ,COMMA quite a good clue ,COMMA except you have to go back quite a long time .PERIOD <BREAK>
and that's a very plausible idea .PERIOD <BREAK>
who should get the best ones ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
i could imagine grandmothers being able to do social-plays with their granddaughters ,COMMA with their friends ,COMMA and to be able to share all kinds of other activities around the house ,COMMA like sharing a bedtime story .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's no longer the case that the security of a country is simply a matter for its soldiers and its ministry of defense .PERIOD <BREAK>
and for the next three years ,COMMA her fate will be having sex with him every day ,COMMA as a favor for getting her in school .PERIOD <BREAK>
like a wide-eyed kid ,COMMA i'd say ,COMMA why is that ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
this is another way that our mind was shifted ,COMMA and twitter wasn't what we thought it was .PERIOD <BREAK>
ok ,COMMA so since you all don't understand what the five-ball pattern is ,COMMA i'm going to give you a little clue .PERIOD <BREAK>
i was facing basically a lifetime of dialysis ,COMMA and i don't even like to think about what my life would be like if i was on that .PERIOD <BREAK>
well ,COMMA acknowledge them .PERIOD <BREAK>
can i request a moment of absolute silence ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
rule one is you don't talk about /b/ .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's about time .PERIOD end sequence .PERIOD take one .PERIOD <BREAK>
and he liked to do an exercise with his students where he got them to take a piece of paper and draw the person who sat next to them ,COMMA their neighbor ,COMMA very quickly ,COMMA just as quickly as they could .PERIOD <BREAK>
i'll show you in a moment that the stack of paper there would probably hold something like <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> tests ,COMMA something of that kind .PERIOD <BREAK>
i'm a geophysicist ,COMMA and all my earth science books when i was a student -- i had to give the wrong answer to get an a .PERIOD <BREAK>
so birds do it too .PERIOD <BREAK>
and where water is liquid ,COMMA it becomes a womb for cells green with chlorophyll -- and that molecular marvel is what's made a difference -- it powers everything .PERIOD <BREAK>
this data's from all over the world -- countries spend billions of dollars investing in this kind of research .PERIOD <BREAK>
now ,COMMA the other thing that fashion designers have done to survive in this culture of copying is they've learned how to copy themselves .PERIOD <BREAK>
but lists like this become kind of numbing ,COMMA so let me just say this :COLON if you're a progressive ,COMMA if you're driving a prius ,COMMA or you're shopping green ,COMMA or you're looking for organic ,COMMA you should probably be a semi-vegetarian .PERIOD <BREAK>
when i was six years old ,COMMA i fell in love with magic .PERIOD <BREAK>
and ,COMMA of course ,COMMA arctic communities are toast .PERIOD <BREAK>
there are people -- a lady came up to me the other day ,COMMA and she had a white piece of paper -- michael ,COMMA you'll like this one -- and she said ,COMMA what do you see in it ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
so julie's going to her doctor's office to get treated for her asthma .PERIOD <BREAK>
so this is a real human brain .PERIOD <BREAK>
what i mean by that is that it's time for architecture to do things again ,COMMA not just represent things .PERIOD <BREAK>
the bad news is we don't know exactly what's causing this ,COMMA but here's what you should do ,COMMA here's what we should do .PERIOD <BREAK>
but i've had this forever .PERIOD <BREAK>
that's why i like what i do .PERIOD <BREAK>
one knob is the knob for controlling global temperature .PERIOD <BREAK>
the rhythm can get much smaller .PERIOD <BREAK>
and all of a sudden i thought ,COMMA well ,COMMA wait a minute .PERIOD <BREAK>
because we can't eliminate a single seat ,COMMA the architecture is restricted to <NUM> inches .PERIOD <BREAK>
so the first consistent component of regret is basically denial .PERIOD <BREAK>
and if we look at a very pristine environment like western australia ,COMMA lars bider has done work comparing dolphin behavior and distribution before there were dolphin-watching boats .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's a death sentence .PERIOD <BREAK>
but this is the same choice you guys just faced .PERIOD <BREAK>
focus the one on the right .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's because of this that you need the magnetic braking system .PERIOD <BREAK>
so we thought that this is what was happening :COLON that children in groups can self-instruct themselves to use a computer and the internet .PERIOD but under what circumstances ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
for the first time in human history -- and barring aliens landing or some major other pandemic ,COMMA that's the expectation from demographers ,COMMA going forward .PERIOD <BREAK>
the site has adult content on it .PERIOD <BREAK>
there's stories that you may tell in a small group of people with some good wine .PERIOD <BREAK>
the british government -- any government is potentially the worst client in the world you could ever possibly want to have .PERIOD <BREAK>
you are the reason why i said yes to the invitation to come here today .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so i think that we're going to see over the next <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> years a real science of creativity that's burgeoning and is going to flourish .PERIOD <BREAK>
now what i'm also interested in is :COLON is it possible to separate intrinsic and extrinsic beauty ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
so today at lmbc ,COMMA we're building cells <NUM> inches in diameter with a capacity of one kilowatt-hour -- <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> times the capacity of that initial shotglass cell .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i'm also being told that the drum is without snares .PERIOD <BREAK>
so that's my dirty little secret .PERIOD don't tell anyone .PERIOD <BREAK>
little froggy legs .PERIOD <BREAK>
right after i completed my ph .PERIOD d .PERIOD i was lucky enough to be included with a group of scientists that was using it for the first time as a tool for ocean exploration .PERIOD <BREAK>
i skied competitively throughout high school ,COMMA and i got a little restless in college because i wasn't doing anything for about a year or two sports-wise .PERIOD <BREAK>
so it's empathy that makes us connect to other people .PERIOD <BREAK>
they provide opportunities to be more physically active ,COMMA as well as local economic development .PERIOD <BREAK>
the retailers have kind of quashed this notion though .PERIOD <BREAK>
orbital hotels to start with ,COMMA but workshops for the rest of us later on .PERIOD <BREAK>
thank you so much .PERIOD <BREAK>
so first of all we did deals with <NUM> different countries .PERIOD <BREAK>
they kidnapped her ,COMMA they put her in a car .PERIOD <BREAK>
we are not here to question the possible ;SEMICOLON we are here to challenge the impossible .PERIOD <BREAK>
so it's not far-fetched to say that ,COMMA at some point ,COMMA online video is going to dramatically accelerate scientific advance .PERIOD <BREAK>
we have <NUM> official languages that are recognized in our constitution .PERIOD <BREAK>
so as your model is close to reality ,COMMA and it converges with feelings ,COMMA you often don't know it's there .PERIOD <BREAK>
we found activity in some cells called the a <NUM> cells ,COMMA cells that actually make dopamine ,COMMA a natural stimulant ,COMMA and spray it to many brain regions .PERIOD <BREAK>
they both kept their day jobs .PERIOD here's the last mine .PERIOD <BREAK>
but we are crazy .PERIOD we do these things .PERIOD <BREAK>
i watched the man open a pack of cigarettes with trembling hands and offer one to her ,COMMA and that is the image of the night of the earthquake in my mind today -- a conservative grocer and a crying transvestite smoking together on the sidewalk .PERIOD <BREAK>
despite their best efforts ,COMMA genetically engineered crops are the most rapidly successful agricultural innovation in history .PERIOD <BREAK>
she's working her way through college .PERIOD <BREAK>
i went to his home town .PERIOD <BREAK>
i'll make it easier ,COMMA actually ,COMMA by blowing one of the lines up .PERIOD <BREAK>
second ,COMMA in play -- he's a national champion bridge player .PERIOD <BREAK>
the mentor of warren buffett ,COMMA benjamin graham ,COMMA developed his system of value investing as a result of his own losses in the <NUM> crash .PERIOD <BREAK>

if we invest about <NUM> billion dollars ,COMMA we could make a severe inroad into that problem .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i said ,COMMA ma ,COMMA would you slow down ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and it does this burst of energy .PERIOD <BREAK>
so i thought ,COMMA you know what ,COMMA i'm going to start with connection .PERIOD <BREAK>
i'll show you where we are at the moment in working towards that concept .PERIOD <BREAK>
so i sent this company an email saying ,COMMA hello .PERIOD i'm christien .PERIOD i'm doing this research .PERIOD <BREAK>
that's the detail part .PERIOD <BREAK>
so i decided to create a platform for that potential .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's a technical tour de force .PERIOD <BREAK>
afghanistan ,COMMA we know what a serious security problem afghanistan is for so many of us in the world .PERIOD <BREAK>

why does this happen ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
this is still the way we're communicating messages about health .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it's been slow coming ,COMMA and we're only making about <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> a week ,COMMA but we hope ,COMMA we hope ,COMMA sometime in next year ,COMMA maybe by the middle of the year ,COMMA to hit a million a month .PERIOD now put that number ,COMMA and a million isn't so much .PERIOD it's not a big number .PERIOD <BREAK>

and so we were rowing ,COMMA and one of these western grebes came along .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the evidence for evolution ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
now ,COMMA i look at it somewhat as a way -- when you learn juggling what you learn is how to feel with your eyes ,COMMA and see with your hands because you're not looking at your hands ,COMMA you're looking at where the balls are or you're looking at the audience .PERIOD <BREAK>
whenever possible ,COMMA refuse single-use and disposable plastics .PERIOD <BREAK>
people like kenneth miller could be called a godsend to the evolution lobby -- -- because they expose the lie that evolutionism is ,COMMA as a matter of fact ,COMMA tantamount to atheism .PERIOD <BREAK>
so i've been working on the idea of computation now for more than <NUM> years ,COMMA building tools and methods and turning intellectual ideas into millions of lines of code and grist for server farms and so on .PERIOD <BREAK>
what we found ,COMMA however ,COMMA was that they took an extremely long time -- over <NUM> years -- to regenerate ,COMMA starting from the bottom and growing up .PERIOD <BREAK>
i'll give you a couple of more examples on irrational decision-making .PERIOD <BREAK>
so we started off with about <NUM> volunteers ,COMMA and then we had about <NUM> ,COMMA and then a couple hundred .PERIOD <BREAK>

government ,COMMA well ,COMMA one thing that comes to mind is the u .PERIOD s .PERIOD government ,COMMA among others ,COMMA is literally starting to pay people to lose weight .PERIOD <BREAK>
so we see the galaxy and fixate on that ,COMMA but it's actually a cloud of dark matter that's dominating the structure and the dynamics of this galaxy .PERIOD <BREAK>
because it worked .PERIOD <BREAK>
there are two kinds of errors people make when trying to decide what the right thing is to do ,COMMA and those are errors in estimating the odds that they're going to succeed ,COMMA and errors in estimating the value of their own success .PERIOD <BREAK>
after him followed the post-modern counter-revolution ,COMMA robert venturi saying ,COMMA less is a bore .PERIOD <BREAK>
now ,COMMA it works just like a regular phone .PERIOD <BREAK>
there's a prophesy .PERIOD you have to save the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
and to do this ,COMMA i knew that i had to see the way in which artists work ,COMMA understand the artist's studio as a laboratory ,COMMA imagine ,COMMA then ,COMMA reinventing the museum as a think tank and looking at the exhibition as the ultimate white paper -- asking questions ,COMMA providing the space to look and to think about answers .PERIOD <BREAK>
like ,COMMA how lame is that ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
so ,COMMA i think i'm going to leave it at that :COLON the robots are coming ,COMMA we don't have too much to worry about ,COMMA it's going to be a lot of fun ,COMMA and i hope you all enjoy the journey over the next <NUM> years .PERIOD <BREAK>

so we said ,COMMA well ,COMMA these will be on round tables and the order around the table had to be the same ,COMMA so that at my site ,COMMA i would be ,COMMA if you will ,COMMA real and then at each other's site you'd have these plastic heads .PERIOD <BREAK>

there's new programmability in these parts .PERIOD <BREAK>
this one in seattle is on the site of a mall parking lot adjacent to a new transit stop .PERIOD <BREAK>

small country ,COMMA not so rich .PERIOD president said he'd do it ,COMMA and guess what ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
galvani's approach of probing the nervous system with electrodes has remained state-of-the-art until today ,COMMA despite a number of drawbacks .PERIOD <BREAK>
so that's really cool -- you can take it to london or siberia ,COMMA and your next door neighbor can dial your home number and your phone will ring ,COMMA because it's got everything in the box .PERIOD <BREAK>
i feel skinny ,COMMA but i'm not .PERIOD <BREAK>
another exciting thing we did last year was with communications technology .PERIOD <BREAK>
at no point will the fireman look taller than the fiddler .PERIOD no point .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so ,COMMA i thought ,COMMA if this could work ,COMMA anything could work .PERIOD <BREAK>
people would look at these and say ,COMMA man ,COMMA this thing is so big and so hard to swallow .PERIOD if this doesn't make me feel better ,COMMA you know ,COMMA what possibly could ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
construction play -- it’s playful ,COMMA obviously ,COMMA but also a powerful way to learn .PERIOD <BREAK>
the second big enabler is intellectual property ,COMMA because in fact i got up here and i talked about how great the music culture is .PERIOD <BREAK>
let's create a word processor that's just a word processor .PERIOD <BREAK>
the yeast comes alive and starts eating the sugars ,COMMA creating carbon dioxide and alcohol -- essentially it's burping and sweating ,COMMA which is what bread is .PERIOD <BREAK>
it might take a long time .PERIOD nobody wrote down the rules clearly .PERIOD <BREAK>
all of this effort results in an inert object .PERIOD <BREAK>
and balinese carpenters like this measured them with their bamboo rulers ,COMMA selected the bamboo and built the buildings using age-old techniques ,COMMA mostly by hand .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA this is what some colleagues of mine at caltech did .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's as if the whole population had to shift from being basses to singing as a tenor .PERIOD <BREAK>
well ,COMMA lets go back to the <NUM> th century .PERIOD <BREAK>
and you've got to get better ,COMMA and better ,COMMA and better ,COMMA and better .PERIOD <BREAK>
and that was done ,COMMA effectively ,COMMA by october <NUM> or something ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
if we could do that ,COMMA this could be extremely powerful .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it declined very fast -- a classic boom and bust fishery ,COMMA which suggests that a stock has been depleted or there's low reproductive rates .PERIOD <BREAK>
because i'm seeing a lot of these geeky nerdy kids ,COMMA and the teachers out in the midwest ,COMMA and the other parts of the country ,COMMA when you get away from these tech areas ,COMMA they don't know what to do with these kids .PERIOD <BREAK>
her dream of going to school ,COMMA her wish of being educated ,COMMA is finally here .PERIOD <BREAK>

you have to go to youtube and type in iphone shuffle .PERIOD <BREAK>

but i want to turn that upside down for a moment ,COMMA and get something out on the table and clear the air so to say .PERIOD <BREAK>
we are here on top .PERIOD <BREAK>
there's a problem with a traditional scientific paper .PERIOD <BREAK>
all of that could be described using newton's work .PERIOD <BREAK>
as he said to me ,COMMA that really pissed the french off .PERIOD <BREAK>
it is all about passion .PERIOD <BREAK>
the other thing we discovered is that efficiency doesn't matter so much if your energy source is free .PERIOD <BREAK>
another one is a moving object and a third is a time .PERIOD <BREAK>
maitreya then took him to a certain heaven ,COMMA which is the typical way a buddhist myth unfolds .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i realized ,COMMA wow ,COMMA this would really make a big difference ,COMMA if we could do it ,COMMA and so i said ,COMMA well ,COMMA let's look at it .PERIOD <BREAK>
i read all the books in english and go to most of the lectures .PERIOD <BREAK>
and climate change is certainly going to turn all of our theories and predictions on their heads .PERIOD <BREAK>
i've gone and had an fmri myself ,COMMA to see how my visual cortex is taking over .PERIOD <BREAK>
and other studies of populations at risk sensitized me to the importance of play ,COMMA but i didn't really understand what it was .PERIOD <BREAK>
one thing is that the subway is running and rumbling right under the hall .PERIOD <BREAK>
i set out to look at natural forms .PERIOD <BREAK>
that's terrific .PERIOD thank you .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA we try to get to the door ,COMMA and we run to the door ,COMMA and we open the door and it's like walking into a blast furnace .PERIOD <BREAK>
they were happy because the story survived ,COMMA and that the world would keep on spinning .PERIOD <BREAK>
it has a symbolic importance .PERIOD <BREAK>
it was a great moment ,COMMA and it utterly changed my life .PERIOD <BREAK>
when we compare those hundred years of video ,COMMA we're comparing it against millions of reference files in our database .PERIOD <BREAK>
or you could actually meet my need .PERIOD <BREAK>
they're actually developing a lot of their science and engineering curriculum to spread widely around the world in our system and they're also trying to develop all of their software tools completely open-source .PERIOD <BREAK>
we need to cut the spigot of single-use and disposable plastics ,COMMA which are entering the marine environment every day on a global scale .PERIOD <BREAK>
woman :COLON it's completely blind now ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
now ,COMMA there are many details left to explore in this scheme -- political ,COMMA practical ,COMMA ethical ,COMMA financial .PERIOD <BREAK>
and they moved in ,COMMA and decided not to pay me any rent .PERIOD <BREAK>
it took them a while to formulate plan b .PERIOD <BREAK>
oh -- yours does ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
or at home ,COMMA if that's where they choose to be educated with their families or their friends .PERIOD <BREAK>
and you also have to consider the state of mind you're in when you're doing this .PERIOD <BREAK>
maybe it was just that they could put sugar in their tea and offer that to me when i came as their guest and that made them feel proud .PERIOD <BREAK>
notice that we don't do this in science .PERIOD <BREAK>
but moses ,COMMA if you saw the movie ,COMMA the ten commandments ,COMMA moses goes out ,COMMA and there's this burning bush ,COMMA and god talks to him .PERIOD <BREAK>
however ,COMMA your brain isn't doubling every two years .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i stumbled across something called cancer stem cells .PERIOD <BREAK>
but i was in milan and saw this street sign ,COMMA and was very happy to see that apparently this idea of minimalism has even been translated by the graffiti artist .PERIOD <BREAK>
but that's too complicated for today ,COMMA so i'll simplify it for you ,COMMA and i give you one average point for each survey .PERIOD <BREAK>
if anybody want to help us this is what we need .PERIOD <BREAK>
toyin alousa :COLON nollywood is the best thing that can happen to them .PERIOD <BREAK>
and she begins to babble and coo and smile ,COMMA and so does the baby .PERIOD <BREAK>
we get one child like that about every classroom of <NUM> kids who will actually cut straight to the chase .PERIOD <BREAK>
and in fact barack obama did quite well .PERIOD <BREAK>
each country's a bubble .PERIOD <BREAK>
so where i started was with connection .PERIOD <BREAK>
and on the basis of several points ,COMMA the oceans are complex ,COMMA and they're central to the life on earth .PERIOD <BREAK>
i went to afghanistan in <NUM> to work on a financial times piece ,COMMA and there i met kamila ,COMMA a young women who told me she had just turned down a job with the international community that would have paid her nearly $ <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> a month -- an astronomical sum in that context .PERIOD <BREAK>
the book-shaped dictionary is not going to be the only shape dictionaries come in .PERIOD and it's not going to be the prototype for the shapes dictionaries come in .PERIOD <BREAK>

and then up above there's a garden on this side of the living room ,COMMA and one on the other side .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's two resins that are ,COMMA sort of ,COMMA in and of themselves -- neither of which can make glue ,COMMA but when you put the two together ,COMMA something happens .PERIOD a bond takes place ,COMMA and you get this very strong ,COMMA powerful adhesive .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA looking at other parts of europe's periphery ,COMMA such as north africa .PERIOD <BREAK>
young people would ask the most amazing questions .PERIOD <BREAK>
there is one case that we have begun to understand better ,COMMA and it's the case of fireflies .PERIOD <BREAK>

from there ,COMMA the greatest innovation of all came about in this market ,COMMA which is that buyers and sellers could transact grain without actually having to physically or visually inspect the grain .PERIOD <BREAK>
so this is a catastrophe .PERIOD <BREAK>
and when you touch it with your finger ,COMMA you can actually ,COMMA then ,COMMA introduce all the forces on the face of that screen ,COMMA and that actually has a certain amount of value .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the fundamental problem is we don't actually have a word for this stuff .PERIOD <BREAK>
in the vaccine area ,COMMA synthetic genomics and the institute are forming a new vaccine company because we think these tools can affect vaccines to diseases that haven't been possible to date ,COMMA things where the viruses rapidly evolve ,COMMA such with rhinovirus .PERIOD <BREAK>
so what is this impossible hyperbolic structure ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and a good example of this is the rio tinto ,COMMA which is in portugal .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so ,COMMA you have these grand rituals where great images of mother goddesses are built and worshiped for <NUM> days .PERIOD <BREAK>
and what we know now is this has huge impact on economies ,COMMA which i'll talk about later .PERIOD <BREAK>
the goal is to control cancer .PERIOD <BREAK>

and one thing about cars is we're all a little bit like pygmalion ,COMMA we are completely in love with our own creations .PERIOD <BREAK>
i'm a writer and a journalist ,COMMA and i'm also an insanely curious person ,COMMA so in <NUM> years as a journalist ,COMMA i've learned how to do a lot of new things .PERIOD <BREAK>
i thought i was famous enough that i would raise the money within one month ,COMMA but i've been humbled .PERIOD <BREAK>
and we created videos and packaging for many musicians that you know ,COMMA and for even more that you've never heard of .PERIOD <BREAK>
our reichstag project ,COMMA which has a very familiar agenda ,COMMA i'm sure ,COMMA as a public place where we sought to ,COMMA in a way ,COMMA through a process of advocacy ,COMMA reinterpret the relationship between society and politicians ,COMMA public space .PERIOD and maybe its hidden agenda ,COMMA an energy manifesto -- something that would be free ,COMMA completely free of fuel as we know it .PERIOD <BREAK>
but actually i think the most exciting thing about this is that it really gives one the chance to democratize programming .PERIOD <BREAK>
a boy broke away from his mother to run back into his house to get his dog ,COMMA who was apparently afraid .PERIOD <BREAK>
that's a lot of people to have a lot of problems -- and this is even in so-called nerve-sparing surgery ,COMMA which means that the surgeon is aware of the problem ,COMMA and they are trying to avoid the nerves .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it became a gateway to the community .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA back in the ancient times .PERIOD <BREAK>
i mean ,COMMA you can talk about that stuff ,COMMA and you can write these large reports ,COMMA and you can get government money to do it ,COMMA but these -- they actually measured it ,COMMA and it turns out that in the last <NUM> years -- that's why they say decadal there -- that the energy -- that the level of what they call imbalance has been way the hell over what was expected .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's going to reserve the technology for the wealthy because they are in the best position to circumvent any of these sorts of laws .PERIOD <BREAK>
so it was a necessity .PERIOD <BREAK>
that is a wonderful idea .PERIOD <BREAK>
she was <NUM> years old ,COMMA and she was in a marriage and her husband was beating her on a regular basis ,COMMA and she couldn't get out because she was addicted to the relationship and she had no money .PERIOD her sister was younger than her and she applied -- we had a stop rape contest a few years ago in new york -- and she applied ,COMMA hoping that she would become a finalist and she could bring her sister .PERIOD <BREAK>
and out of that field campaign we'll probably get a few dozen papers on a few dozen processes or molecules .PERIOD <BREAK>
ok ,COMMA back to danny's list .PERIOD <BREAK>
is new york a scaled up san francisco ,COMMA which is a scaled up santa fe ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
so we're asking for human artifice to become a living thing ,COMMA and we want growth ,COMMA we want free energy from sunlight and we want an open metabolism for chemicals .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so i came back with that news to cambridge ,COMMA and bragg said ,COMMA build models .PERIOD <BREAK>
the kids got the pills ,COMMA and then their performance improved .PERIOD <BREAK>
and david believed ,COMMA like we do in the visual effects industry ,COMMA that anything is possible as long as you have enough time ,COMMA resources and ,COMMA of course ,COMMA money .PERIOD <BREAK>
most of the information that we collected on the cholera outbreak didn't come from testing water ;SEMICOLON it came from forms like this ,COMMA which documented all the people we failed to help .PERIOD <BREAK>

i decided against clothing because i wanted the figure to be without any cultural implications or time-specific elements .PERIOD <BREAK>
yes ,COMMA it does -- quite wonderfully .PERIOD <BREAK>

especially if you're hungry and your kids are hungry and your neighbor's kids are hungry and your whole neighborhood is hungry ,COMMA you're pretty angry .PERIOD <BREAK>
and this seems quite a profound question .PERIOD <BREAK>
our children are growing up very quickly learning to read ,COMMA learning to use machinery .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's big ,COMMA it's heavy .PERIOD you can't carry it away ,COMMA so you bang it with your hammer ,COMMA and you break off a piece .PERIOD <BREAK>
and this turns out to have a special power all its own ,COMMA because people could feel that these leaders were at the helm ,COMMA not because they enjoyed directing others and not out of the pleasure of being looked at ;SEMICOLON they were there because they had no choice ,COMMA because they were driven to do what they thought was right .PERIOD <BREAK>
and its shape is what gives it the function of being able to tumble through air so easily .PERIOD look at that shape .PERIOD <BREAK>
well ,COMMA again ,COMMA the schematic view is that the eye visually interrogates what we look at .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is something that we've been semi-quietly working on for the last year and a half or so .PERIOD <BREAK>
but we can't move the earth ,COMMA at least not easily ,COMMA but we can move a small asteroid .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA what about that ?QUESTIONMARK well ,COMMA here's a couple of things .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the logic of our experiment was simple .PERIOD <BREAK>
thank you .PERIOD <BREAK>
a huge opportunity ,COMMA unleashing of new potential for innovation ,COMMA for development .PERIOD <BREAK>

well ,COMMA a lot of natural gas and a little bit of nuclear ,COMMA for starters .PERIOD <BREAK>
and this is how he's going to turn thought back into action .PERIOD <BREAK>

i took several containers -- my wife said ,COMMA if i could do this ,COMMA anybody could -- and i ended up growing a seed garden .PERIOD <BREAK>

we have wireless blood pressure cuffs .PERIOD <BREAK>
so the patient had an actual arm ,COMMA which is painful ,COMMA in a sling for a few months or a year ,COMMA and then ,COMMA in a misguided attempt to get rid of the pain in the arm ,COMMA the surgeon amputates the arm ,COMMA and then you get a phantom arm with the same pains ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>

pjc :COLON it's a very profound notion to know that we as women are at the vanguard of this .PERIOD <BREAK>

the bad news is if they've collected this person and he or she is missing an arm or leg ,COMMA part of the face ,COMMA it's probably not coming back .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA in some sense ,COMMA a lot of marketing is about convincing a ceo ,COMMA this is a good ad campaign .PERIOD <BREAK>

when i arrived at the rehearsal ,COMMA only <NUM> kids had shown up ,COMMA and i said to myself ,COMMA do i close the program or multiply these kids ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
you could never afford to have a standby crew of people <NUM> hours a day and do what we're doing at wikipedia .PERIOD <BREAK>
they'll be able to focus their hearing ,COMMA they'll be able to increase the sensitivity ,COMMA decrease the sensitivity ,COMMA do a series of things that we can't do .PERIOD <BREAK>
they throw up anti-access ,COMMA area-denial asymmetrical strategies .PERIOD <BREAK>
they get returned ,COMMA and when they get returned ,COMMA here on a nasa numerical ocean you can see bluefin in blue go across their corridor ,COMMA returning to the western pacific .PERIOD <BREAK>
and this is not just specific to ethiopia ,COMMA but happens over and over ,COMMA all over africa .PERIOD <BREAK>
but one area which is particularly intriguing for us is the northern region ,COMMA you know ,COMMA of mars ,COMMA close to the north pole ,COMMA because we see ice caps ,COMMA and we see the ice caps shrinking and expanding ,COMMA so it's very much like you have in northern canada .PERIOD <BREAK>
and what i've tried to do since i had my training as a medical illustrator -- since i was taught animation by my father ,COMMA who was a sculptor and my visual mentor -- i wanted to figure out a way to help people understand truth and beauty in the biological sciences by using animation ,COMMA by using pictures ,COMMA by telling stories so that the things that are not necessarily evident to people can be brought forth ,COMMA and can be taught ,COMMA and can be understood .PERIOD <BREAK>
and now look at the chart .PERIOD <BREAK>
the bert rutans and richard bransons of this world have got this in their sights and i salute them .PERIOD <BREAK>
biological nutrition can supply about <NUM> million humans ,COMMA which means that if we all wore birkenstocks and cotton ,COMMA the world would run out of cork and dry up .PERIOD <BREAK>
so with hydro maxed out ,COMMA coal and lose the climate ,COMMA or nuclear ,COMMA which is the current operating low-carbon source ,COMMA and maybe save the climate .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it's within these tribes that all of our work gets done .PERIOD <BREAK>
but there is a curious asymmetry here .PERIOD <BREAK>
it has these strong ,COMMA heroic arms that can lift doughnuts into your mouth .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i have to now share a few stories of girls i've seen across the planet who have engaged their girl ,COMMA who have taken on their girl in spite of all the circumstances around them .PERIOD <BREAK>
well ,COMMA on december <NUM> ,COMMA a company called quanta agreed to build it ,COMMA and since they make about one-third of all the laptops on the planet today ,COMMA that question disappeared .PERIOD <BREAK>
that's like every man ,COMMA woman and child on the planet having a serving of coke every week .PERIOD <BREAK>
and while this machine in some sense is silly ,COMMA in retrospect ,COMMA it actually served a very important purpose .PERIOD <BREAK>
so let's take a deeper look .PERIOD <BREAK>
i thought ,COMMA when i first became a therapist <NUM> years ago ,COMMA that if i was good enough to make someone not depressed ,COMMA not anxious ,COMMA not angry ,COMMA that i'd make them happy .PERIOD <BREAK>
he says to me ,COMMA we've done some work around the country .PERIOD <BREAK>
now ,COMMA i think that this is a great metaphor for the state of architecture and architects today .PERIOD <BREAK>
the younger face is getting unhappy .PERIOD <BREAK>
i started this with <NUM> dollars ,COMMA and start fundraising money to where i've been going .PERIOD <BREAK>
you know ,COMMA when it's needed ,COMMA the authority is there .PERIOD it's very important .PERIOD <BREAK>
library of congress holds <NUM> million volumes .PERIOD <BREAK>
evolution works that way .PERIOD <BREAK>
there's also a great deal ,COMMA i think ,COMMA of religious illiteracy around .PERIOD <BREAK>
where did it come from ?QUESTIONMARK who said it ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
i started writing on a computer back in the <NUM> s when one of the first atech systems was installed at the chicago sun-times .PERIOD <BREAK>
we know that there was a lenape settlement down here by the collect pond .PERIOD <BREAK>
you don't have millions and millions of dollars ,COMMA but you can call your representatives ,COMMA and you can remind them that you vote ,COMMA and you can ask not to be treated like a thief ,COMMA and you can suggest that you would prefer that the internet not be broken .PERIOD <BREAK>
and one thing is clear ,COMMA which is at least now we know that africa is open for business .PERIOD <BREAK>
she starts leaning back .PERIOD <BREAK>
and a more recent one :COLON the possibility of sustaining high culture in our time is becoming increasing problematical .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is the work of dr .PERIOD bruce miller .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's for sure -- for me -- it's the ultimate feeling of being in free fall ,COMMA with all the visual references .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so next time your neighbor sees you they'll say ,COMMA how is that tadpole doing ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and it taught me three lessons that i think are so important for us today ,COMMA and certainly in the work that i do .PERIOD <BREAK>
a new technology will come along to fix the messes we made with the last one .PERIOD <BREAK>
and of course the spirit people have a little miniature village in their village ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
he had a huge ambition .PERIOD <BREAK>
my story is a little bit complicated .PERIOD <BREAK>
and here's where the dead people start to help us out ,COMMA because lots of people have studied the problem of packing circles .PERIOD <BREAK>
and critically ,COMMA the social constraints created a culture that was more generous than the contractual constraints did .PERIOD <BREAK>
now i don't know if any of you out there invented chicken nuggets ,COMMA but i'm sure you're rich if you did .PERIOD <BREAK>
fact is ,COMMA there's a general rule :COLON if you don't like it ,COMMA it's fake ;SEMICOLON if you do like it ,COMMA it's faux .PERIOD <BREAK>
boy :COLON panthers ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
thank you .PERIOD <BREAK>
they accumulate the water .PERIOD <BREAK>
it can't really make the difference that ought to be made in a period of crisis .PERIOD <BREAK>
it took much longer than sometimes we like to think in this story ,COMMA but by <NUM> ,COMMA when the next big cholera outbreak came to london ,COMMA the authorities had been convinced -- in part because of this story ,COMMA in part because of this map -- that in fact the water was the problem .PERIOD <BREAK>
it doesn't mean i won't some day .PERIOD but i haven't done it ,COMMA and the reason is an understanding of these human needs that i want to talk to you about .PERIOD <BREAK>
you cannot do that in two seconds and have a minuscule part of the card showing .PERIOD <BREAK>
so wherever you look ,COMMA the message ,COMMA it seems to me ,COMMA is the same :COLON that less is very often more ,COMMA that slower is very often better .PERIOD but that said ,COMMA of course ,COMMA it's not that easy to slow down ,COMMA is it ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
today ,COMMA we've got great technology :COLON we have gps .PERIOD <BREAK>
that's the warm up .PERIOD <BREAK>
along with that is a kind of spirit of equality .PERIOD we're all basically equal .PERIOD <BREAK>
just wire the chimps up to love that look ,COMMA and apparently they do .PERIOD <BREAK>
we started with a natural occurring clay called montmorillonite .PERIOD <BREAK>
it has a lot of disadvantages :COLON each one of these steps is extremely expensive ,COMMA it's potentially dangerous and they have the interesting property that the step cannot be performed in anyone's backyard ,COMMA which is a problem .PERIOD <BREAK>
it depends upon how you look at the life of the people .PERIOD <BREAK>
blindness ,COMMA polio -- early detection ,COMMA early response .PERIOD <BREAK>
now the irony ,COMMA from my perspective ,COMMA is that the only people who seem to generally agree with me and who think that there are right and wrong answers to moral questions are religious demagogues of one form or another .PERIOD <BREAK>
but that's enormously important for policy .PERIOD <BREAK>
but the thing is that you don't decide what gets in .PERIOD <BREAK>
so never mind ;SEMICOLON you're fine just being yourself .PERIOD <BREAK>
i'm not going anywhere .PERIOD <BREAK>
we had a show that just came down last week in new york .PERIOD <BREAK>
and we know this because when we study different language groups and associate them with their cultures ,COMMA we see that different languages slow the flow of ideas between groups .PERIOD <BREAK>
possible departure dates :COLON october <NUM> to february <NUM> .PERIOD <BREAK>
and she's got a very large house .PERIOD <BREAK>
they have a computer chip strapped to their backs ,COMMA and they can fly these creatures around the lab .PERIOD <BREAK>
today ,COMMA though ,COMMA i’m going to talk about darwin’s other strange inversion ,COMMA which is equally puzzling at first ,COMMA but in some ways just as important .PERIOD <BREAK>
but the first few systems were these leaky ,COMMA loud power-guzzlers that martha stewart would definitely never have approved .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA let's never forget ,COMMA whether at ted ,COMMA or anywhere else ,COMMA that whatever brilliant ideas you have or hear ,COMMA that the opposite may also be true .PERIOD <BREAK>
so what else can you do to safeguard your marriage ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and i've never been to design school .PERIOD <BREAK>
and maybe ,COMMA indirectly ,COMMA get at some of the issues of what caused them to be the way they are .PERIOD <BREAK>
how did we achieve that ,COMMA whether you think it's a good thing or not ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
so it is very ,COMMA very simple once you learn how to read it .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is a little stone ball ,COMMA floating .PERIOD <BREAK>
because the problem there is just as severe ,COMMA but it is more sinister ,COMMA because vitamin d deficiency ,COMMA from a lack of ultraviolet b radiation ,COMMA is a major problem .PERIOD <BREAK>
and as i tell you this ,COMMA i'm also aware of the fact that it sounds like ,COMMA oh ,COMMA okay ,COMMA it sounds like we could do it ,COMMA but can we really do it ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and it is an awesome thing to be a part of empowering someone in this way .PERIOD <BREAK>
when i arrive -- and i take one minute ,COMMA i am not so intelligent -- when i arrive at the level of animal species ,COMMA that becomes real interesting .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it's only a few months since governments injected enormous sums of money to try and keep the whole system afloat .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA with the energy of everybody that was there i decided to keep pushing .PERIOD <BREAK>
when the wind blows ,COMMA it rotates and generates .PERIOD <BREAK>
because what that question assumes is that our external world is predictive of our happiness levels ,COMMA when in reality ,COMMA if i know everything about your external world ,COMMA i can only predict <NUM> percent of your long-term happiness .PERIOD <BREAK>
instead of pointing out her husband's growing gut or suggesting he go for a run ,COMMA she might say ,COMMA wow ,COMMA honey ,COMMA thank you for going out of your way to make me relatively thinner .PERIOD <BREAK>
and you can let them social network with your tadpole ,COMMA because the environmental health clinic has a social networking site for ,COMMA not only impatients ,COMMA humans ,COMMA but non-humans ,COMMA social networking for humans and non-humans .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the gut is a silent voice -- it's going more for feelings .PERIOD <BREAK>
but you know ,COMMA i have a problem with children's books :COLON i think they're full of propaganda .PERIOD <BREAK>
as our former vice president said ,COMMA we have to become activists .PERIOD <BREAK>
we know three things about intelligence .PERIOD <BREAK>
she uses smart boards ,COMMA she blogs ,COMMA she tweets ,COMMA she does facebook ,COMMA she does all this sort of high-tech stuff .PERIOD <BREAK>
it was the advice that i decided to follow myself when i turned <NUM> .PERIOD <BREAK>
girl <NUM> :COLON i think we -- the reasons ,COMMA one of the reasons we put computer before tv is because nowadays ,COMMA like ,COMMA we have tv shows on the computer .PERIOD <BREAK>
why not eat insects ?QUESTIONMARK well first ,COMMA what are insects ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
actually ,COMMA there was an appeal worldwide for new detectors in the sustainable environments where they're needed to produce ,COMMA which is mainly in the developing world .PERIOD <BREAK>
and we've now surveyed organisms from all over the tree of life -- every kingdom of life except for animals ,COMMA we see slightly differently .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i think we make a fundamental mistake -- we make an assumption ,COMMA that we think that ,COMMA if people need something ,COMMA we don't have to make them want that .PERIOD <BREAK>
yeah ,COMMA i definitely have to be moving ,COMMA and balance is a little bit of an art in them .PERIOD <BREAK>
and later i can find a wall ,COMMA anywhere ,COMMA and start browsing those photos or maybe ,COMMA ok ,COMMA i want to modify this photo a little bit and send it as an email to a friend .PERIOD <BREAK>
i need to go to the mall ,COMMA and you know your father now ,COMMA he takes a nap in the afternoon ,COMMA and i got to go .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i want to ask three questions in this talk ,COMMA in the <NUM> minutes that remain ,COMMA about the blogosphere .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so here it is in the stomatopod .PERIOD and again ,COMMA this is a situation where engineers are very familiar with this phenomenon ,COMMA because it destroys boat propellers .PERIOD <BREAK>
we may be able to use them differently .PERIOD <BREAK>
i can't believe in the doctrines .PERIOD <BREAK>
invest ,COMMA invest ,COMMA invest .PERIOD <BREAK>
i'm very proud because i think i'm the only person in america to out bible-talk a jehovah's witness .PERIOD <BREAK>
and instead of valuing it ,COMMA we throw it away .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i think some of these technologies will enable us to be more connected with our patients ,COMMA and take more time and actually do the important human touch elements of medicine ,COMMA as augmented by these sorts of technologies .PERIOD <BREAK>
the phone rings anyway ,COMMA he's called to the palazzo .PERIOD <BREAK>
not a complicated thing .PERIOD <BREAK>
and indeed ,COMMA on the inputs to the hippocampus ,COMMA cells are found which project into the hippocampus ,COMMA which do respond exactly to detecting boundaries or edges at particular distances and directions from the rat or mouse as it's exploring around .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA now ,COMMA you've always had this exploration bug in you .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i like this because it challenges the way that we design stuff ,COMMA and build stuff ,COMMA and potentially distribute stuff .PERIOD <BREAK>
you may be surprised to know that eight speakers yesterday actually mentioned these terms in their talks .PERIOD <BREAK>
thank you .PERIOD <BREAK>
we're coming around a cliff here on the right .PERIOD <BREAK>
so i'm really sorry .PERIOD but when you use a part of something -- like the dictionary is a part of the language ,COMMA or a flag stands for the united states ,COMMA it's a symbol of the country -- then you're using it synecdochically .PERIOD <BREAK>
you can see this is the left extension .PERIOD <BREAK>
our consciousness of that thing that we're attending to becomes extremely bright and vivid ,COMMA and everything else sort of goes dark .PERIOD <BREAK>
this was in the bahamas at about <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> feet .PERIOD <BREAK>
he's like ,COMMA is this still the rehearsal ,COMMA or should i untie him ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and i think that djabran fluctus ,COMMA that fits that mode .PERIOD <BREAK>
now ,COMMA the interesting thing about this is ,COMMA you don't have to be an engineer to appreciate why a <NUM> -foot pole that can fit in your pocket is so interesting .PERIOD <BREAK>
sometimes you have a toxic bloom ;SEMICOLON sometimes you don't .PERIOD <BREAK>
in walking around at the break ,COMMA many of you had met members of your tribe .PERIOD and you were talking to them .PERIOD <BREAK>
you have your molecular compiler ,COMMA you can do whatever you want .PERIOD <BREAK>
that was it .PERIOD <BREAK>
it also requires being connected to a lot of management assistance .PERIOD <BREAK>
as grown in new york ,COMMA the fruit usually fails to develop properly in size and quality and is ,COMMA on the whole ,COMMA unsatisfactory .PERIOD <BREAK>
if things worked better because you actually had somebody organizing them ,COMMA you had firms ,COMMA if you wanted to be in the market -- or you had governments or sometimes larger non-profits in the non-market .PERIOD <BREAK>
these organisms we now bring into the lab ,COMMA and you can see some of them growing on petri plates ,COMMA and get them to reproduce the precise biominerals that we find on the walls of these caves .PERIOD <BREAK>
when intel does surveys all around the world and we say ,COMMA quick response :COLON healthcare .PERIOD <BREAK>
and that's what i'm going to describe to you today .PERIOD <BREAK>
thank you .PERIOD <BREAK>
and he despised it from the bottom of his heart .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's actual useful .PERIOD it's got value .PERIOD <BREAK>
an investment -- investment ,COMMA after all ,COMMA is just such a basic economic concept -- is nothing more nor less than a relationship between the present and the future ,COMMA a shared present and a common future .PERIOD <BREAK>
but ,COMMA overwhelmingly ,COMMA it's your past performance .PERIOD <BREAK>
if you're in the jungle ,COMMA it's about <NUM> meters .PERIOD so if a kid bicycles home ,COMMA or walks a few miles ,COMMA they're going to be off the grid ,COMMA so to speak .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i didn't understand why ,COMMA in one hand they say ,COMMA speak the truth ,COMMA in the other hand ,COMMA when you say the truth ,COMMA they hated you .PERIOD <BREAK>
and thanks for listening to what i had to say .PERIOD <BREAK>
and fourth ,COMMA as a result of that exclusion ,COMMA you end up with a professional class .PERIOD look at the change here .PERIOD <BREAK>
and a few people got excited about it .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's when the internet combines with these kinds of passionate pro-am consumers -- who are knowledgeable ;SEMICOLON they've got the incentive to innovate ;SEMICOLON they've got the tools ;SEMICOLON they want to -- that you get this kind of explosion of creative collaboration .PERIOD <BREAK>
so the question is ,COMMA why not eat insects ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
to create is to make something that has never existed before .PERIOD <BREAK>
bottom ,COMMA all <NUM> .PERIOD <BREAK>
so it's a homeless pigeon now and it's going to have to find another place to live ,COMMA and that allows me to go through my catalog of favorite things ,COMMA and we start with the tall ones and so on .PERIOD <BREAK>
and just remember ,COMMA at very least tacitly ,COMMA this is what we're teaching children as what they should be doing .PERIOD <BREAK>
now there are several biases in risk perception .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so there was a feeling that there was great pride in what we can do .PERIOD <BREAK>
thanks ,COMMA chris .PERIOD <BREAK>
paul maccready :COLON if we could have the second video ,COMMA the one-minute ,COMMA put in as quickly as you can ,COMMA which -- this will show the pathfinder airplane in some flights this past year in hawaii ,COMMA and will show a sequence of some of the beauty behind it after it had just flown to <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> feet -- higher than any propeller airplane has ever flown .PERIOD <BREAK>
i remember what she looked like before she left .PERIOD <BREAK>
and then ,COMMA that energy is sort of spreading throughout his thought areas .PERIOD <BREAK>
right on the slopes of the koariti .PERIOD <BREAK>
now ,COMMA this is one model of how language comes to be :COLON namely ,COMMA it's legislated by an academy .PERIOD <BREAK>
we say small ,COMMA but what does that mean ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
almost every field of science engineering and clinical practice is involved in trying to get this to happen .PERIOD <BREAK>
you know ,COMMA i may appear to be a very nice ,COMMA clean ,COMMA sweet boy .PERIOD <BREAK>
it gives a voice to those who otherwise would not have a voice .PERIOD <BREAK>
other emotional stuff .PERIOD <BREAK>
seven .PERIOD is there any possible way that i could know what seven digit numbers you have ?QUESTIONMARK say no .PERIOD <BREAK>
and this is from delhi .PERIOD <BREAK>
i want to know how they impact me .PERIOD <BREAK>
and if you zoom in <NUM> times ,COMMA you'll see it looks like a rug .PERIOD <BREAK>
the destabilizing effects of hunger are known throughout human history .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it was incredible .PERIOD <BREAK>
now ,COMMA i mean it makes me crazy .PERIOD <BREAK>
does your mindset correspond to my dataset ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
because clouds can mean anything you want .PERIOD <BREAK>
there's air-sea interactions .PERIOD <BREAK>
and this is karljohan ,COMMA one of my graduate students who's been working on this project .PERIOD <BREAK>
gdp counts everything from air pollution to the destruction of our redwoods .PERIOD <BREAK>
every day ,COMMA <NUM> hours ,COMMA that pump is at your side ,COMMA administering medicine directly to your heart ,COMMA and it's not a particularly preferable medicine in many senses .PERIOD <BREAK>
a year and a half ago ,COMMA four of the five people who are full time members at ushahidi ,COMMA which means testimony in swahili ,COMMA were ted fellows .PERIOD <BREAK>
and then i started thinking ,COMMA well ,COMMA of course ,COMMA we can't just get rid of captchas ,COMMA because the security of the web sort of depends on them .PERIOD <BREAK>
losing that ice is like losing the soil in a garden .PERIOD <BREAK>
of course ,COMMA ted ,COMMA the reputation precedes itself all over the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
and by the time the movie comes out in may ,COMMA this will be updated to <NUM> .PERIOD <NUM> and we will have click-through purchases of offsets .PERIOD <BREAK>
i would give my viewpoints to people .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i'll just share a cartoon of this idea here .PERIOD <BREAK>
the nature of the model depends on the kind of animal we are .PERIOD <BREAK>
that's my daughter ,COMMA jean .PERIOD <BREAK>
all that green stuff actually naturally absorbs storm water ,COMMA also helps cool our cities .PERIOD <BREAK>
so it challenged everything we knew in cancer ,COMMA is that you don't need to get a response .PERIOD <BREAK>
harkening back to susan blackmore's talk ,COMMA we now have a means of transmitting information with heredity and selection ,COMMA and we know where that leads .PERIOD <BREAK>
and not only that ,COMMA they make the analogy to relativity theory and cosmology often .PERIOD <BREAK>
you know ,COMMA we spend <NUM> billion dollars -- why don't we spend that on doing good in the world ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
so we started to wonder ,COMMA what would a drug company do at this point ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
whether it was through settling down in agricultural communities ,COMMA all the way through modern medicine ,COMMA we have changed our own evolution .PERIOD <BREAK>
in very short ,COMMA people who have more activity in the right side of the prefrontal cortex are more depressed ,COMMA withdrawn .PERIOD they don't describe a lot of positive affect .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so we're in a skull ,COMMA and we're moving really ,COMMA really quickly .PERIOD <BREAK>
we wanted to see how this applies to collaborative ,COMMA distributed music making ,COMMA where nobody has any idea what it is they're working on .PERIOD <BREAK>
this time ,COMMA not only did my collectors disappear ,COMMA the political activists decided to ban me and to threaten me and to forbid me from showing .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's friendly -- she's underlined friendly -- that's probably why she calls it hercules or hercles .PERIOD she can't spell .PERIOD <BREAK>
it lasts forever .PERIOD it's a very strange medium .PERIOD <BREAK>
they want to figure out how things work ;SEMICOLON they want to get access to it ;SEMICOLON and they want to control it .PERIOD <BREAK>
this may be one of the ultimate papers .PERIOD <BREAK>
last year there were a couple of kids from elite schools that came to ask for admissions in our school .PERIOD <BREAK>
and as i grew older ,COMMA i then auditioned for the royal academy of music in london ,COMMA and they said ,COMMA well ,COMMA no ,COMMA we won't accept you ,COMMA because we haven't a clue ,COMMA you know ,COMMA of the future of a so-called 'deaf' musician .PERIOD <BREAK>
on my way out ,COMMA i had to break a fight apart .PERIOD <BREAK>
is it bigger than the biggest bacterium ?QUESTIONMARK we don't know .PERIOD <BREAK>
politicians have recently begun twittering .PERIOD <BREAK>
we believed that where the resources and expertise are scarce ,COMMA innovative ,COMMA sustainable design can really make a difference in people's lives .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is a squishy head ,COMMA for no apparent reason .PERIOD <BREAK>
every <NUM> years i do a picture .PERIOD here's the one -- tries to show that the world isn't getting any bigger .PERIOD <BREAK>
take it away eric .PERIOD <BREAK>
this technology is intra-active .PERIOD <BREAK>
or do you continue feeding the civilians ,COMMA knowing that the genocidaires are in the camps ,COMMA literally sharpening their knives for future battle ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
this is the reality of diabetes .PERIOD <BREAK>
they thought it'd be more innovative without it .PERIOD <BREAK>
and then so she realized i couldn't catch live ones ,COMMA so she brought me dead penguins .PERIOD <BREAK>
so this ascent of man ,COMMA pinnacle of evolution ,COMMA has got to go .PERIOD <BREAK>
and ,COMMA as you can see ,COMMA they don't use their first names .PERIOD <BREAK>
i love when i'm in the laboratory ,COMMA a new spider silk sequence comes in .PERIOD <BREAK>
and think of it being done with just a few people .PERIOD <BREAK>
yet again ,COMMA your pattern detection devices are fooled .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA this rise of this sort of local currency is another really interesting phenomenon .PERIOD <BREAK>
but everyone on that bus is frieda .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it's also become a very ,COMMA very valuable sort of advertising revenue for j&amp ;SEMICOLON j as well .PERIOD <BREAK>
so this is the list ,COMMA and this is the one i'd like to share with you .PERIOD <BREAK>
and we're getting there .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is my home .PERIOD this is where i live .PERIOD <BREAK>
you think that .PERIOD it's not true ,COMMA of course ,COMMA but that's the media impression ,COMMA and that's like what you get .PERIOD <BREAK>
fifteen is a pretty optimal number .PERIOD <BREAK>
and with the new generation of scanning tools ,COMMA for the first time we can actually see individual inter-neural fibers and see them processing and signaling in real time -- but then the question is ,COMMA ok ,COMMA we can get this data now ,COMMA but can we understand it ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
something amazing happened during this shoot .PERIOD <BREAK>
but up until ,COMMA literally ,COMMA <NUM> years ago ,COMMA that was all we knew about planets .PERIOD <BREAK>
but nowadays ,COMMA your typical classroom has pods of desks -- four or five or six or seven kids all facing each other .PERIOD <BREAK>
with the mosque ,COMMA with the synagogue ,COMMA saying ,COMMA we must start to speak to one another .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA everyone told me afterwards that inviting the prospective parents over was ,COMMA again ,COMMA the stupidest thing i could have possibly done ,COMMA because who's ever good enough for your relative ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
you have to present yourself in digital life in a similar way that you would in your analog life .PERIOD <BREAK>
he said he'd lived his whole life there by the beach ,COMMA and that he would rather die there than run .PERIOD <BREAK>

if i sing you a musical scale :COLON a ,COMMA b ,COMMA c ,COMMA d ,COMMA e ,COMMA f ,COMMA g -- and i just carry on with the next set of letters in the alphabet ,COMMA same scale :COLON h ,COMMA i ,COMMA j ,COMMA k ,COMMA l ,COMMA m ,COMMA n ,COMMA o ,COMMA p ,COMMA q ,COMMA r ,COMMA s ,COMMA t -- there you go .PERIOD <BREAK>
up ,COMMA up ,COMMA up .PERIOD <BREAK>
you can do it by getting yourself in a situation where you put more tattoos and earrings in places humans don't want to know .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it's because of people like my colleague ,COMMA rick wilson ,COMMA at the genome institute at washington university ,COMMA who decided to take a look at this woman postmortem .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is a laundry chute ,COMMA and this right here is a shoe last .PERIOD <BREAK>
look at star wars .PERIOD you got the droids ;SEMICOLON they meet the mysterious woman .PERIOD <BREAK>
but by the end of the <NUM> th century ,COMMA a new generation of critics and reformers had come to see philanthropy just this way .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so they just do the same thing over and over and over again .PERIOD <BREAK>
i don't know about another category ,COMMA but we all know how to think .PERIOD <BREAK>
how much of the money is going into concrete and boosting consumption ,COMMA not into solving the really profound problems we have to solve .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is some shot ,COMMA by dr .PERIOD mike latz at scripps institution ,COMMA of a dolphin swimming through bioluminescent plankton .PERIOD <BREAK>

however ,COMMA there was another case ,COMMA the eastland ,COMMA a ship that capsized in chicago harbor in <NUM> ,COMMA and it killed <NUM> people -- that was <NUM> more than the passenger toll of the titanic .PERIOD <BREAK>
and there's some younger clones dotting the landscape behind it .PERIOD <BREAK>
and taking that into the world of climate change -- which is ,COMMA frankly ,COMMA the mt .PERIOD everest of all problems -- just because we've lived the way we have lived for so long ,COMMA just because we have consumed the way we have for so long and populated the earth the way we have for so long ,COMMA doesn't mean that we can carry on the way we are carrying on .PERIOD <BREAK>
thirty years have passed since my father's first job as a community game guard .PERIOD <BREAK>
so i have a particular imaginative approach to visual work .PERIOD <BREAK>
we take water and push it against a membrane .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA do you believe it's possible to see through somebody else's eyes ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and i knew it would grow to become the proud beginnings of the community-led revitalization of the new south bronx .PERIOD <BREAK>
we are blessed with a language ,COMMA a system of communication ,COMMA so powerful and so precise that we can share what we've learned with such precision that it can accumulate in the collective memory .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so we started thinking .PERIOD <BREAK>
a key revolution is that we're understanding our own biology in these information terms .PERIOD <BREAK>
statistics show that we are living in a relatively peaceful era .PERIOD <BREAK>
but this mortality banner is the very sword which mammography's most ardent advocates use to deter innovation .PERIOD <BREAK>
it will go perfectly on the day of the walk .PERIOD <BREAK>
so often ,COMMA seven days a week .PERIOD family business equals child labor .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's not a thing i often do ,COMMA so listen carefully .PERIOD <BREAK>
then i'd say ,COMMA how do you know ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
jehane noujaim :COLON i think everybody's had that feeling of sitting in a theater ,COMMA in a dark room ,COMMA with other strangers ,COMMA watching a very powerful film ,COMMA and they felt that feeling of transformation .PERIOD <BREAK>
i didn't know who it was ,COMMA i didn't know what they wanted ,COMMA and natasha could tell they were firemen trying to get us out .PERIOD <BREAK>
well ,COMMA would it help if i .PERIOD <BREAK>
how do we see that galaxy ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
but our homemade play-dough actually has half the resistance of commercial play-doh .PERIOD <BREAK>
now ,COMMA the system may gradually -- under pressure of climate change ,COMMA erosion ,COMMA biodiversity loss -- lose the depth of the cup ,COMMA the resilience ,COMMA but appear to be healthy and appear to suddenly ,COMMA under a threshold ,COMMA be tipping over .PERIOD upff .PERIOD <BREAK>
it doesn't taste good ,COMMA so i'm going to need some help with that .PERIOD <BREAK>
question :COLON how much faster did this group solve the problem ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
but secondly ,COMMA to incentivize that inoculation by giving a kilo of lentils to everybody who participated .PERIOD <BREAK>
so we went over into michael's garage -- his dad had all kinds of stuff ,COMMA and we put a pipe in the vice there ,COMMA and screwed a cap on the end of the pipe ,COMMA drilled a hole in the back of the pipe ,COMMA took some of our firecrackers ,COMMA pulled out the fuses ,COMMA tied them together ,COMMA put them in the back there ,COMMA and -- down in that hole -- and then stuffed some of our gunpowder down that pipe and put three ball bearings on the top ,COMMA in the garage .PERIOD <BREAK>
and this is the mimic .PERIOD <BREAK>
it was one of the most unequal co-authoring relationships ever -- -- but i was glad to be the beneficiary of it .PERIOD <BREAK>
and not uniquely but certainly ,COMMA the octopus in australia are masters at camouflage .PERIOD <BREAK>
i felt pretty good ,COMMA considering .PERIOD <BREAK>
you do it in your sneakers .PERIOD <BREAK>
even the slightest hint of color on the underbelly of a cloud would inform them and help them navigate with the keenest accuracy .PERIOD <BREAK>
but one thing that i want to say ,COMMA because it's similar to what his holiness said .PERIOD <BREAK>
many of these deaths were completely preventable ,COMMA and this what i want to think of as the disconcerting thing ,COMMA what i want to call the last mile problem .PERIOD <BREAK>
that is until last year ,COMMA when eduardo won the coup de coeur ,COMMA the coveted french gastronomic prize .PERIOD <BREAK>
so the first thing i thought of is we have to thank him .PERIOD <BREAK>
can we use the physical simulation of the character ,COMMA use artificial intelligence ,COMMA put that artificial intelligence into the character ,COMMA drive virtual muscles ,COMMA simulate the way he jumps off the dam ,COMMA and then skydive afterwards ,COMMA and have him caught by a bungee afterwards ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and there was a bright spot up there .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's going to be very simple for us to use .PERIOD <BREAK>
this was considered as first evidence that actually black holes come from supernovae explosions .PERIOD <BREAK>
and we look at this and we think ,COMMA well ,COMMA how does that apply ,COMMA for example ,COMMA for the design of -- the lessons from this -- apply to the design of online services ,COMMA future services in these markets ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
he talked about the world as it is and the world as it should be .PERIOD <BREAK>
we didn't want to shout ;SEMICOLON we needed to listen as well .PERIOD <BREAK>
i think we could roll the tape ,COMMA admin .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i knew that frogs -- little frogs -- had aspirations of space travel ,COMMA just like people .PERIOD and i -- i was looking for a -- a propulsion system that would like ,COMMA make a rocket ,COMMA like ,COMMA maybe about four feet high go up a couple of miles .PERIOD <BREAK>
notice ,COMMA first of all here ,COMMA that you have exactly three pieces of information there ,COMMA each of which will figure into a formula somewhere ,COMMA eventually ,COMMA which the student will then compute .PERIOD <BREAK>
and that's me in the background ,COMMA carving around the whole formation in freefall also ,COMMA with the helmet cam to film this jump .PERIOD <BREAK>
i thought ,COMMA i'm failing as a teacher .PERIOD <BREAK>
now i was known as here's a woman that's not going to listen .PERIOD <BREAK>
narrator :COLON the first group builds a cubicle in which the walls are screens for the computer and for family photos .PERIOD <BREAK>
we do not create revolutions .PERIOD <BREAK>
i am grateful for the fact that i had a mentor like mau who taught me how to navigate .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's a greenhouse ,COMMA where kids get told all about food and growing their own food .PERIOD <BREAK>
why ?QUESTIONMARK because they consider this as contrary to the security interest of the people of great britain .PERIOD <BREAK>
but let's take a look behind my eyes .PERIOD <BREAK>
yeah ,COMMA two-meter span .PERIOD <BREAK>
now your <NUM> st century ears are quite happy with this last chord ,COMMA even though a while back it would have puzzled or annoyed you or sent some of you running from the room .PERIOD <BREAK>
and finally ,COMMA what i think you will see is the intelligent ,COMMA closed organizations moving increasingly in the open direction .PERIOD <BREAK>
so every second ,COMMA half of the library of congress is swooshing around in this machine .PERIOD it's a big machine .PERIOD <BREAK>
now ,COMMA this is not only about numbers ;SEMICOLON this is not only about the fact that we're seven billion people committed to nine billion people ,COMMA it's an equity issue as well .PERIOD <BREAK>
a lot of us work for people ;SEMICOLON we're in the hands of other people .PERIOD <BREAK>
and yes ,COMMA this is quite trivial ,COMMA but actually the lessons from this can apply to that kind of personal area networks .PERIOD <BREAK>
most schools in america spend less than <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> dollars a year teaching a child .PERIOD <BREAK>
she ,COMMA like so many of the women i see at a to z ,COMMA worked hard every day ,COMMA understood what suffering was ,COMMA had a deep faith in god ,COMMA loved her children and would never have accepted a handout .PERIOD <BREAK>
those of you who know me know how passionate i am about opening the space frontier .PERIOD <BREAK>
but they were onto something and they got better at it .PERIOD <BREAK>
we've got to limit other mandatory spending .PERIOD <BREAK>
oxygen ,COMMA hydrogen and zinc have their own signature .PERIOD <BREAK>
thank you very much .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's very easy to pick up a stainless-steel bottle or a glass bottle ,COMMA if you're traveling and you've forgotten to bring your stainless-steel bottle and fill that up with water or filtered water ,COMMA versus purchasing plastic bottled water .PERIOD <BREAK>
and therefore democracy has become embedded .PERIOD <BREAK>
and flowers are a real bugger .PERIOD <BREAK>
the trees ,COMMA mangrove trees ,COMMA are filled with fireflies communicating with light .PERIOD <BREAK>
now if i were to come to you face-to-face and come this close to you ,COMMA you would feel threatened .PERIOD <BREAK>
glorious !EXCLAMATIONMARK this guy is not saying ,COMMA well ,COMMA you know ,COMMA there were some nice guys .PERIOD they had a gym .PERIOD <BREAK>
and if that's not shaming enough ,COMMA i got that ticket in italy .PERIOD <BREAK>
i've had some great meals at cafeterias .PERIOD <BREAK>
i would spend hours looking at just the connections ,COMMA saying ,COMMA oh ,COMMA the little kid up at the top has red hair ;SEMICOLON so does that first generation up there .PERIOD <BREAK>
you're either an incredibly good scammer ,COMMA and you're getting away with it -- you gamed the system -- or you're some kind of boy genius ,COMMA the likes of which the world has never seen .PERIOD <BREAK>
and all the people in this room have done so through their business lives ,COMMA or their philanthropic work ,COMMA or their other interests .PERIOD <BREAK>
this was ,COMMA for example ,COMMA an image that went into tatler .PERIOD <BREAK>
all of these represent gaps between potential mind and actual mind .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA now they don't stop here ,COMMA or even down here .PERIOD <BREAK>
and you know what ?QUESTIONMARK sometimes it should .PERIOD <BREAK>
he's at a technology conference in florida .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA he's bluffing .PERIOD let's do it backwards -- i thought he was joking when he first showed it to me .PERIOD <BREAK>
we went down to the airfield early because this is the army and you always go early .PERIOD <BREAK>
are you freaking out ?QUESTIONMARK you look so cute .PERIOD <BREAK>
this diagram was our sort of position piece about the book ,COMMA and our position was ,COMMA books are technology -- that's something people forget -- but it's a form of technology that will have to share its dominance with any other form of truly potent technology or media .PERIOD <BREAK>
i was going in the tunnels of paris ,COMMA on the rooftops with my friends .PERIOD <BREAK>
other elements were mines ,COMMA weather ,COMMA approaches and elevation .PERIOD <BREAK>
websites attract striking writers :COLON operators of sites like mydamnchannel .PERIOD com could benefit from labor disputes .PERIOD <BREAK>
again ,COMMA that's one of the themes that i think has come through loud and clear in this conference is :COLON where do we start ?QUESTIONMARK how do we start ?QUESTIONMARK what do we do to start ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
we made it all freely available on the web ,COMMA just to -- it was obviously our chance of helping out with the cause .PERIOD <BREAK>
thanks .PERIOD <BREAK>
so you've got an interface that has no interface .PERIOD <BREAK>
he doesn't quite know what to do ,COMMA so he starts going around the crowd and starts talking to people in the crowd and he says to people in this rather unique way ,COMMA how does it feel to be free ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
they want the washing machine in exactly the same way .PERIOD <BREAK>
so i tried bronze casting .PERIOD <BREAK>
i know when i'm licked .PERIOD <BREAK>
conflict parties also need to be prepared to return to the negotiation table if the agreement implementation stalls .PERIOD <BREAK>
they spend all this time working on certain problems ,COMMA but there's another thing lingering there that they're interested in ,COMMA but they can't quite solve .PERIOD <BREAK>
you know he'd be in the office till three in the morning working with us and there was this kind of sense of the nomad in him .PERIOD <BREAK>
i can't believe it .PERIOD <BREAK>
again ,COMMA similar story around the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
and ,COMMA as you can imagine ,COMMA if you can picture this :COLON i was born in a very small village in mexico ,COMMA in ,COMMA unfortunately ,COMMA very poor surroundings ,COMMA and my parents did not have a college education .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i do think there's more innovation ahead of us than there is behind us .PERIOD <BREAK>
and we can now use this as what i think will be a major medical breakthrough .PERIOD <BREAK>
we must now finally come to think about the premises of a truly global world ,COMMA in relationship to the regime of rights and responsibilities and accountabilities that are truly global in scope .PERIOD <BREAK>
that what we are living in is a century of idea diffusion .PERIOD <BREAK>
classic .PERIOD hip fracture often leads to institutionalization of a senior .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the last day ,COMMA the sun comes out ,COMMA the orcas come ,COMMA they're right by the boat .PERIOD it's fantastic .PERIOD <BREAK>
and if they don't admit you ,COMMA they're the ones who are messed up .PERIOD <BREAK>
so here's a select number of projects .PERIOD <BREAK>
and sometimes it takes a wake-up call ,COMMA doesn't it ,COMMA to alert us to the fact that we're hurrying through our lives ,COMMA instead of actually living them ;SEMICOLON that we're living the fast life ,COMMA instead of the good life .PERIOD <BREAK>
what's interesting also is -- note that netflix was founded in <NUM> .PERIOD <BREAK>
we currently know about over <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> pieces of software that can send twitter updates -- interfaces for mac ,COMMA windows ,COMMA your iphone ,COMMA your blackberry -- as well as things like a device that lets an unborn baby twitter when it kicks or a plant twitter when it needs water .PERIOD <BREAK>
so i want you to imagine when in a couple of years ,COMMA when we've started to apply this cloud-based information ,COMMA when we really have the a .PERIOD i .PERIOD physician and leverage our brains to connectivity to make decisions and diagnostics at a level never done .PERIOD <BREAK>
she goes on a pill a day that targets a pathway ,COMMA and again ,COMMA i'm not sure if this pathway was in the system ,COMMA in the cancer ,COMMA but it targeted a pathway ,COMMA and a month later ,COMMA pow ,COMMA that cancer's gone .PERIOD <BREAK>
went on until a new rabbi came .PERIOD rabbis always spoil things .PERIOD <BREAK>
so what we're going to do now is take the white people in the survey and split them between those who have black neighbors -- or ,COMMA really ,COMMA some neighbor of another race -- and people who have only white neighbors .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is just for the united states of america .PERIOD historical average for january is <NUM> degrees .PERIOD last month was <NUM> .PERIOD <NUM> degrees .PERIOD <BREAK>
heat from within made geysers erupt -- that is how the oceans were born .PERIOD <BREAK>
so we live in the boonies .PERIOD <BREAK>
and along with that ,COMMA some acetic acid .PERIOD <BREAK>
and you can see ,COMMA this led is going to glow .PERIOD <BREAK>
you realize that this poses a fundamental challenge to any theory of the brain ,COMMA and especially to a theory that says that there is some reality that emerges out of this carpet ,COMMA out of this particular carpet with a particular pattern .PERIOD <BREAK>
you don't know how you do it .PERIOD <BREAK>
my mother was claimed by the war .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is a utility room for a woman who is on a walker .PERIOD <BREAK>
i did a study of the top epidemiologists in the world in october .PERIOD <BREAK>
well because all of the grid-like firing patterns have the same axes of symmetry ,COMMA the same orientations of grid ,COMMA shown in orange here ,COMMA it means that the net activity of all of the grid cells in a particular part of the brain should change according to whether we're running along these six directions or running along one of the six directions in between .PERIOD <BREAK>
and there's not even statistics on africa to know what is happening .PERIOD <BREAK>
the teachers are going to tell us how we're most useful .PERIOD <BREAK>
i had to meet my love .PERIOD <BREAK>
and ,COMMA of course ,COMMA at kleiner we ,COMMA kind of ,COMMA apologize and say the second best way is to finance it .PERIOD <BREAK>
perhaps we feel that many of our relationships have not had closure .PERIOD <BREAK>
we're curious ,COMMA and we just go out and get knowledge ,COMMA you know ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and i think everybody -- i mean that should be a matter of fact ,COMMA like gravity .PERIOD <BREAK>
katrina showed us that we cannot completely depend on government to have readiness in hand ,COMMA to be capable of handling things .PERIOD <BREAK>
it is because i have had life-altering experiences in virtual space ,COMMA and video games had begun to erode my own understanding of what is real and what is not .PERIOD <BREAK>
i do not believe that meditation and prayer will change this world .PERIOD <BREAK>
for generations ,COMMA we've been raising our children ,COMMA not unlike millions of other species living beside us .PERIOD <BREAK>
but whenever i get a chance i still work on my series .PERIOD <BREAK>
don't embarrass yourself .PERIOD <BREAK>
now speaking of evolution ,COMMA from basic biology ,COMMA you probably remember that the animal kingdom ,COMMA including humans ,COMMA have four basic primal instincts .PERIOD <BREAK>
because facing your own mortality causes a re-evaluation of priorities ,COMMA and a realignment of what your goals are in life ,COMMA unlike anything else .PERIOD <BREAK>
and we developed a pattern together that scales to arbitrarily large size ,COMMA but that allows any flat ring or disc to fold down into a very neat ,COMMA compact cylinder .PERIOD <BREAK>
so in those moments ,COMMA you certainly wonder what you're doing up there or -- ca :COLON what was the closest you got to -- when did you think ,COMMA this is it ,COMMA i might be on my way out ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
first is physiological .PERIOD <BREAK>
so they pick the worst background from any kind of powerpoint presentation ,COMMA the worst typeface .PERIOD <BREAK>
but right now we don't have enough of that .PERIOD <BREAK>
so i decided to ask why .PERIOD and here's some of ,COMMA i guess ,COMMA my hypotheses that i'll be starting to investigate this may at the sylvester cancer institute in miami .PERIOD <BREAK>
and she looked up and said ,COMMA now that's better .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is crystallized dna .PERIOD <BREAK>
and on the animal on the right ,COMMA you see that the cancer was responding .PERIOD <BREAK>
we don't really know how to manipulate it ,COMMA though ,COMMA that well .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the daughter was exhausted from caring for her mother .PERIOD <BREAK>
these are patients currently on drugs ,COMMA sharing data .PERIOD <BREAK>
it had everything i needed .PERIOD it was quiet .PERIOD <BREAK>
i'm the happiest guy you're ever going to meet .PERIOD <BREAK>
through many such experiments ,COMMA we were able to narrow down the identity of the critic to just <NUM> cells .PERIOD <BREAK>
what's interesting is ,COMMA once you hit print -- and this is from <NUM> ,COMMA by the way -- all of the artifacts of modern comics start to present themselves :COLON rectilinear panel arrangements ,COMMA simple line drawings without tone and a left-to-right reading sequence .PERIOD <BREAK>
and we're doing it with four percent of the population .PERIOD <BREAK>
'agnostic ,COMMA ' retorted aveling ,COMMA was simply 'atheist' writ respectable ,COMMA and 'atheist' was simply 'agnostic' writ aggressive .PERIOD <BREAK>
well ,COMMA here's a list of them .PERIOD they're hard to tell ,COMMA but there's one billion pc chips on the internet ,COMMA if you count all the chips in all the computers on the internet .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA in order to try to find out the answer to this ,COMMA we got veterinarians from all over the world working with indian vets to try to figure out what was happening .PERIOD <BREAK>
audience :COLON <NUM> .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's like a drug deal .PERIOD <BREAK>
but if i take that same data ,COMMA upload it to decodeme ,COMMA i can look at my risk for sample type ii diabetes .PERIOD <BREAK>
and what is happiness ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
now what i find fascinating about these examples is how they're actually tapping into our primate instincts .PERIOD <BREAK>
perhaps even in some arrangement that's a little bit like an escrow account ,COMMA where you put land in the escrow account and the partner nation takes responsibility for it .PERIOD <BREAK>
nope .PERIOD nothing's in my pockets .PERIOD nurse :COLON okay .PERIOD <BREAK>
so this is a mantis shrimp .PERIOD there are the eyes up here ,COMMA and there's that raptorial appendage ,COMMA and there's the heel .PERIOD <BREAK>
the first is ludwig wittgenstein who said ,COMMA i don't know why we are here .PERIOD <BREAK>
and if we were able to reiterate ,COMMA then the fingers of our hand would be people who looked like us ,COMMA and they would have people on their hands and so on .PERIOD <BREAK>
now this situation ,COMMA already i -- you know ,COMMA i don't really like thinking about this ,COMMA although somehow i got myself a job where i have to think about it .PERIOD so the point is that we're very ,COMMA very insecure in terms of developing this material .PERIOD <BREAK>
it would be -- whatever came across the finish line first would be the winner .PERIOD <BREAK>
there was just a big study done ,COMMA and so many schools are starting lunch at nine and <NUM> in the morning .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so ,COMMA already small amounts of technology were transforming the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
which ,COMMA when you actually have to design a beethoven poster ,COMMA comes in handy ,COMMA because the visual information of the logo and the actual poster is exactly the same .PERIOD <BREAK>
christopher poole :COLON when i was <NUM> ,COMMA i found this website called futaba channel .PERIOD <BREAK>
migrating eastward ,COMMA following the grasslands ,COMMA because that's what they were adapted to live on .PERIOD <BREAK>
but those who had announced it quit after only <NUM> minutes ,COMMA on average ,COMMA and when asked afterwards ,COMMA said that they felt much closer to achieving their goal .PERIOD <BREAK>
okay ,COMMA we're going to start with the first stage .PERIOD <BREAK>
but i didn't like the way -- the instruction i got was very poor .PERIOD <BREAK>
i just fell in love with the culture and the people .PERIOD <BREAK>
and to a fish nerd ,COMMA this is some pretty exciting stuff .PERIOD <BREAK>
that compassion is actually an inherent human quality .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is what i'm building now -- they're called soles :COLON self organized learning environments .PERIOD <BREAK>
that's not the expression of joy .PERIOD <BREAK>
it knows how big it is .PERIOD <BREAK>
no ,COMMA i'm sorry .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA if you were to mosquito proof houses ,COMMA you should be able to get these organisms to evolve to mildness .PERIOD <BREAK>
i believe we focus on the lines that cross borders ,COMMA the infrastructure lines .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i discovered that i could be successful in life as an actor ,COMMA without doing crime ,COMMA without cheating nobody ,COMMA without telling no lies .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's very consolidated ,COMMA and the foods that are produced lead to the foods that we eat .PERIOD <BREAK>
yes ,COMMA hairstyling -- i insist on that .PERIOD <BREAK>
and when i started my blog it was really this one goal -- i said ,COMMA i am not going to be famous to the world ,COMMA but i could be famous to people on the internet .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i'd say that it deserves ,COMMA in the spirit of wade davis' talk ,COMMA to be at least put up there with these wonderful creation stories of the peoples of the high andes and the frozen north .PERIOD <BREAK>
even if it's just shame or embarrassment or gossip ,COMMA you need some sort of punishment to bring people ,COMMA when they're in large groups ,COMMA to cooperate .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it has been the study of other religious traditions that brought me back to a sense of what religion can be ,COMMA and actually enabled me to look at my own faith in a different light .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA now that i've scared the crap out of you .PERIOD <BREAK>
and we've never looked back .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA armed with this knowledge ,COMMA sanccob has a chick-bolstering project .PERIOD <BREAK>
first ,COMMA of course you know ,COMMA a leader needs the guts to stand out and be ridiculed .PERIOD <BREAK>
any guesses ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
so we need people to translate the whole web .PERIOD <BREAK>
there he's starting to walk .PERIOD <BREAK>
and in case you don't think that this really has meaning for you ,COMMA remember that cloning is possible ,COMMA and that involves going through childhood again ,COMMA in which case you'll want to be heard just like my generation .PERIOD <BREAK>
and mantis shrimp are officially the fastest measured feeding strike of any animal system .PERIOD so our first surprise .PERIOD <BREAK>
there is no free market for oil .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so what do the monkeys do ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
i later heard that iraqi casualties were not to be treated in taji .PERIOD <BREAK>
the nerds here ,COMMA they get laid -- except for the lady with the condoms in her pocket -- and you say to yourself at some point ,COMMA am i part of this group ?QUESTIONMARK like ,COMMA am i into this ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
that's nine and a half thousand kilometers .PERIOD we never thought that happened .PERIOD <BREAK>
if you come to the south of the intiwatana ,COMMA you find an altar .PERIOD <BREAK>
you decide when you want to turn something on .PERIOD <BREAK>
in switzerland -- germany ,COMMA actually -- on the rhine across from basel ,COMMA we did a furniture factory and a furniture museum .PERIOD <BREAK>
they got the organism to evolve to mildness ,COMMA and they got no development of antibiotic resistance .PERIOD <BREAK>
and in this particular example ,COMMA what i took is some membrane molecules ,COMMA mixed those together in the right environment ,COMMA and within seconds it forms these rather complex and beautiful structures here .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA that's the stage out of all this .PERIOD i find ,COMMA for reasons i don't understand ,COMMA i really do have a goal .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's like the water of the stream ;SEMICOLON it never sits still .PERIOD <BREAK>
hello civilization .PERIOD hello ,COMMA <NUM> st century .PERIOD <BREAK>
and he died when the ambulance was coming to the hospital to take him .PERIOD <BREAK>
our societies now spend two ,COMMA three ,COMMA four percent of gdp to invest systematically in new discovery ,COMMA in science ,COMMA in technology ,COMMA to fuel the pipeline of brilliant inventions which illuminate gatherings like this .PERIOD <BREAK>
ooh ,COMMA he's going to steal ;SEMICOLON he's going to steal ;SEMICOLON he's going to do a terrible thing .PERIOD ' just then ,COMMA two slavers caught up ,COMMA guys chasing slaves ,COMMA looking for jim .PERIOD <BREAK>
want to buy one ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
i usually have to just like try to calm down and take a deep breath .PERIOD <BREAK>
that's my dad .PERIOD my dad was kind of like macgyver ,COMMA really :COLON he would invent ,COMMA like ,COMMA ways to make things heavy .PERIOD <BREAK>
i mean ,COMMA of course ,COMMA this is how americans take it ,COMMA so people all over the middle east ,COMMA not just in your country ,COMMA are protesting .PERIOD <BREAK>
understandably ,COMMA the majority of the medical industry is focused on multiple-use drugs ,COMMA such as long-term daily medications .PERIOD <BREAK>
and you knew what the limit was :COLON they would start getting twitchy and you'd back up ,COMMA come back in a few hours .PERIOD <BREAK>
there is redemption .PERIOD and there is resurrection .PERIOD <BREAK>
but maybe it was time to prove to myself ,COMMA yes ,COMMA it's important to understand the past ,COMMA it is important to look at it in a different light ,COMMA but maybe we should look at the strengths in our own culture and build on those foundations in the present .PERIOD <BREAK>
people have tried for a long time .PERIOD there are a couple of interesting candidates .PERIOD <BREAK>
but we're going to come to accept it over the next <NUM> years or so .PERIOD <BREAK>
by the way ,COMMA this map from <NUM> is out of date because it shows africa still under the thumb of greenpeace ,COMMA and friends of the earth from europe ,COMMA and they're finally getting out from under that .PERIOD <BREAK>
and we need to remember that we're talking about the model t fords ,COMMA the wright flyers ,COMMA compared to what's coming soon .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is how it looks like in practice .PERIOD we have this grass we want to get rid of .PERIOD <BREAK>
last year ,COMMA i was invited to speak at nba all-stars game .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is what's going on in the games industry right now .PERIOD <BREAK>
i hope you'll each take a moment to think about how you could use something like this to give yourself more access to your own world ,COMMA and to make your own travel more convenient and more fun .PERIOD <BREAK>
after <NUM> ,COMMA and before the break up of the soviet union ,COMMA we began to disarm from a nuclear point of view .PERIOD <BREAK>
in the last three years ,COMMA for example ,COMMA the u .PERIOD s .PERIOD protected <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> square miles of ocean as national monuments .PERIOD <BREAK>
that is a huge change in the media landscape we're used to .PERIOD <BREAK>
the press wrote about her death in rather ,COMMA i felt ,COMMA pornographic ways -- like ,COMMA which bit of artery left which bit of body ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
it's an absolute magical wonderland to live in -- if you're a kid interested in animals ,COMMA to grow up in .PERIOD <BREAK>
so you see the leaflets opening and closing -- of this heart valve that's currently being used experimentally to try to get it to further studies .PERIOD <BREAK>
and he urged the people in that meeting ,COMMA in that community ,COMMA to devote themselves to closing the gap between those two ideas ,COMMA to work together to try to make the world as it is and the world as it should be ,COMMA one and the same .PERIOD <BREAK>
here's just one example before i close up .PERIOD <BREAK>
have sex again .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA we've got to rebuild the world institutions .PERIOD <BREAK>
my speechwriters must have been tearing their hair out because as we worked between one and four in the morning on inauguration day ,COMMA i was still changing it .PERIOD <BREAK>
so my thinking here is that we try to motivate those kids to start driving home ideas .PERIOD let them understand what sustainability is ,COMMA and that they have a vested interest in it to happen .PERIOD <BREAK>
you know ,COMMA that one computer was huge .PERIOD <BREAK>
and to get the government permissions ,COMMA you read in the paper ,COMMA you think it's easy to get into cuba everyday ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
now that makes me pause for just a couple reasons .PERIOD <BREAK>
controlling -- you're obviously an idiot ,COMMA so i'm going to make a zillion little processes for you to follow so you don't step out of the box .PERIOD <BREAK>
this was published after he died :COLON his sort of unfinished notes on self-reproducing machines ,COMMA what it takes to get the machines sort of jump-started to where they begin to reproduce .PERIOD <BREAK>
and what has happened in the world ,COMMA i will show now .PERIOD <BREAK>
man :COLON these are live bullets .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so one time i was in a beauty salon ,COMMA and i was trying to decide between two very light shades of pink .PERIOD <BREAK>
there are very few young infants because they die -- high mortality rate -- and there's very few old people .PERIOD <BREAK>
but maybe -- maybe weak and shit -- maybe weak and shit is an important hypothesis that needs more analysis .PERIOD <BREAK>
i do work with different choreographers .PERIOD <BREAK>
so thank you .PERIOD <BREAK>
that report that landed on president johnson's desk when i was two years old -- <NUM> .PERIOD <BREAK>
i think in the case of terrorism ,COMMA it isn't .PERIOD <BREAK>
i mentioned azerbaijan before .PERIOD <BREAK>
it was at that point ,COMMA just the spark of an idea .PERIOD <BREAK>
they have an aids problem .PERIOD i asked -- the u .PERIOD s .PERIOD state department asked the government recently ,COMMA what do you want to do ?QUESTIONMARK and they gave them two problems .PERIOD <BREAK>

everybody has come up to me and said ,COMMA well i'll stockpile water or ,COMMA i'll stockpile food ,COMMA or what have you .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i think that the answer is ,COMMA we can look at mortality data ,COMMA and we can use mortality data to figure out what the prevalence was in the past .PERIOD <BREAK>
that is true .PERIOD that is the reality of the world that we live in .PERIOD <BREAK>
so based on this question ,COMMA we've had a lot of different projects that we've been working on .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is my house .PERIOD <BREAK>
that's what we're trying to provide .PERIOD <BREAK>
they've got to trek under sweltering suns to some of the most remote ,COMMA difficult to reach places in the world .PERIOD <BREAK>

now ,COMMA when i talk about the northeast monsoon season ,COMMA i'm sure many of you here know exactly what i mean ,COMMA but perhaps some of you are not quite so sure .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it would take a full university course to illustrate it .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA to get off the tree ,COMMA i began to use my old computers .PERIOD <BREAK>
we had -- we were being attacked by british airways .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's just very good food .PERIOD <BREAK>
what's interesting about high falls is that although we use airbags ,COMMA and some airbags are quite advanced ,COMMA they're designed so you don't slip off the side like you used to ,COMMA if you land a bit wrong .PERIOD so ,COMMA they're a much safer proposition .PERIOD <BREAK>
now is the time when it's ripe -- ripe for the picking .PERIOD <BREAK>
but we have to be careful because malaria -- the parasite evolves and the mosquito evolves .PERIOD <BREAK>
the key though in all of these ,COMMA the red thread ,COMMA is the shift in mindset ,COMMA moving away from a situation where we simply are pushing ourselves into a dark future ,COMMA where we instead backcast our future ,COMMA and we say ,COMMA what is the playing field on the planet ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>

they want to compress the information -- they just want to send the changes ,COMMA what's new in the image ,COMMA and so on -- and that is how your eyeball is able to squeeze all that information down to your optic nerve ,COMMA to send to the rest of the brain .PERIOD <BREAK>
so let's try changing the rule for this program a little bit .PERIOD <BREAK>
as you all know ,COMMA newsprint yellows significantly in the sun .PERIOD <BREAK>
beginning in <NUM> ,COMMA every general came in saying ,COMMA i've inherited a dismal situation ,COMMA but finally i have the right resources and the correct strategy ,COMMA which will deliver ,COMMA in general barno's word in <NUM> ,COMMA the decisive year .PERIOD <BREAK>
we do not buy people out of slavery .PERIOD <BREAK>

it does an equilibrium glide .PERIOD highly controlled .PERIOD <BREAK>
the door opens and there's a room full of mothers ,COMMA mothers with babies ,COMMA and they're sitting ,COMMA and they're talking ,COMMA they're listening .PERIOD <BREAK>

and we don't invest in what's invisible to us .PERIOD <BREAK>
we're all mammals here ,COMMA we all have a lot of neural and hormonal programming that makes us really bond with others ,COMMA care for others ,COMMA feel compassion for others ,COMMA especially the weak and vulnerable .PERIOD <BREAK>
i mean this comes out .PERIOD <BREAK>
now ,COMMA i've shown you a bunch of lab data ,COMMA and so the real question is :COLON what is the evidence in people that eating certain foods can reduce angiogenesis in cancer ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>

the junk food industry is really great at pressing our pleasure buttons and figuring out what's the most pleasurable .PERIOD <BREAK>
so it turns out that google is a compassionate company ,COMMA because googlers found compassion to be fun .PERIOD <BREAK>
so let's get going because africa ,COMMA to some degree ,COMMA is on a turnaround .PERIOD <BREAK>
they're saving us by redefining and re-imagining a future that defies and blurs accepted polarities ,COMMA polarities we've taken for granted for a long time ,COMMA like the ones between modernity and tradition ,COMMA first world and third world ,COMMA oppression and opportunity .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's not only the forms of cities ,COMMA but the fact that they incarnate emotions ,COMMA not just of those who build them ,COMMA but of those who live there as well .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA it's an open loop control .PERIOD <BREAK>
what this scene is doing ,COMMA and it did in the book ,COMMA is it's fundamentally making a promise .PERIOD <BREAK>
ok ,COMMA so here is the sort of big idea :COLON if you look out at nature ,COMMA you find that as you tend to see suspended animation ,COMMA you tend to see immortality .PERIOD <BREAK>
and there's another pattern here as well .PERIOD can you spot it ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
man :COLON very pleased to welcome you back .PERIOD <BREAK>

in genomics now ,COMMA the genome cost about a billion dollars about <NUM> years ago when the first one came out .PERIOD <BREAK>
and we put them into one of these experiments ,COMMA as you've seen earlier ,COMMA and then we watch lively movement that comes out .PERIOD <BREAK>
and then african-american folks figured out you could take a broken bottle neck ,COMMA just like that -- a nice merlot works very well .PERIOD <BREAK>
look at the client base for this .PERIOD <BREAK>
there were wonderful experiments by bruno munari on letterforms some years ago -- sort of ,COMMA see how far you could go and still be able to read them .PERIOD <BREAK>
another person walks into the lot ,COMMA and they're about to buy a hummer ,COMMA nine miles per gallon ,COMMA fully loaded ,COMMA luxury .PERIOD <BREAK>
over these <NUM> years ,COMMA <NUM> million dollars in affordable financing ,COMMA average interest rate five percent to six percent .PERIOD <BREAK>
once you have more than <NUM> of them you have to develop some kind of a matrix .PERIOD <BREAK>

eight years later ,COMMA when they discovered there was a plot to kill him ,COMMA they dressed him up like a beggar and snuck him out of the country on horseback ,COMMA and took the same trip that tamdin did .PERIOD <BREAK>
but the people who fabricated that solar cooker are women ,COMMA illiterate women ,COMMA who actually fabricate the most sophisticated solar cooker .PERIOD <BREAK>
the output are our symptoms :COLON do we have pain ?QUESTIONMARK is the cancer growing ?QUESTIONMARK do we feel bloated ,COMMA etc .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA there's peruvian chinese food ,COMMA which should not be mixed with mexican chinese food ,COMMA where they basically take things and make it look like fajitas .PERIOD <BREAK>
i mean ,COMMA we want to build frameworks in a way that makes it acceptable and makes it ,COMMA you know ,COMMA productive down the road .PERIOD <BREAK>
and what we have here is no ordinary desk lamp .PERIOD <BREAK>
ok .PERIOD it's done .PERIOD thanks .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's sort of me ,COMMA not we .PERIOD <BREAK>
it was a sunny day and a windy night .PERIOD <BREAK>
the next step after that is to test it in antartica and then ,COMMA if the funding continues and nasa has the resolution to go ,COMMA we could potentially launch by <NUM> ,COMMA and by <NUM> we may have the first evidence of life off this planet .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA i'm just going to show you a basic idea .PERIOD <BREAK>
i wanted to update what i've been doing since then -- but it's still the same theme song -- and introduce you to my lab and current work ,COMMA which is the environmental health clinic that i run at nyu .PERIOD <BREAK>
in other words ,COMMA charles darwin believed in group selection .PERIOD <BREAK>
and laennec thought this would be a wonderful way to listen to the chest or listen to the abdomen using what he called the cylinder .PERIOD <BREAK>
zoom in and that square thing is a theater -- which we're in right now -- the terrace theater .PERIOD it didn't have a name on it .PERIOD <BREAK>
just the pursuit of interest ,COMMA wherever it lies ,COMMA across all the disciplines that are represented here .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's also important to think about what the benefit is .PERIOD <BREAK>
and what they basically did was come out with a prioritized list .PERIOD <BREAK>
but still we have a large deficit in dealing with and understanding modern conflict .PERIOD <BREAK>
this grid is then said to represent the picture of the world's feelings in the last few hours ,COMMA if you will .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it was a very ,COMMA very uncomfortable ,COMMA unpleasant feeling .PERIOD <BREAK>
now you've got to imagine at the moment -- forget this photo ,COMMA imagine this guy with this long ginger beard and this shock of red hair .PERIOD <BREAK>
so we're going to cruise through half a year in about <NUM> seconds .PERIOD <BREAK>
they're super-efficient .PERIOD we had a very low budget to work with .PERIOD <BREAK>
and they say ,COMMA keep your laws off my body .PERIOD <BREAK>
we inspected schools and private residencies .PERIOD <BREAK>
two sugar pills a day beats one sugar pill a day .PERIOD <BREAK>
it indicates the collar that panbanisha must wear when she goes out .PERIOD <BREAK>
and most of these ranches are having trouble keeping going .PERIOD <BREAK>
again ,COMMA which is typical of the computer field ,COMMA is when you have a bug that you can't get rid of you turn it into a feature .PERIOD <BREAK>
and we sent it to oxford ,COMMA england where a group of talented crystallographers provided this picture ,COMMA which helped us understand exactly how this molecule is so potent for this protein target .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is another species of work that i do .PERIOD <BREAK>
and to stop it crashing over the last two to three decades ,COMMA we've expanded the money supply ,COMMA expanded credit and debt ,COMMA so that people can keep buying stuff .PERIOD <BREAK>
no ,COMMA we decided to do a bit more .PERIOD <BREAK>
but it was intended to be quite quiet .PERIOD <BREAK>
let's go back to my first example ,COMMA swaptree .PERIOD <BREAK>
we built an application-programming interface ,COMMA which basically means that programmers can write software that interacts with twitter .PERIOD <BREAK>
i said ,COMMA it would have to show up free .PERIOD <BREAK>
so this image here is going to look like these ones ,COMMA but here i'll show you that we can reconstruct the image ,COMMA so ,COMMA you know ,COMMA you can almost recognize kareem in that top part there .PERIOD <BREAK>
capital ,COMMA malé ,COMMA where i live .PERIOD <BREAK>
on the right hand side ,COMMA that bit there is part of an installation that is about <NUM> feet long .PERIOD <BREAK>
you can also do this with solar cells .PERIOD <BREAK>
assuming -- despite all the dire predictions from many people about our future -- assuming we're still around ,COMMA i can't imagine the world not being populated with robots .PERIOD <BREAK>
they've got to come up ,COMMA warm ,COMMA get that solar power ,COMMA and then plunge back into the depths ,COMMA and go up and down and up and down .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i tell them ,COMMA it's the study of the way in which human beings are shaped by things that they don't see .PERIOD <BREAK>
no life without tectonic activity ,COMMA without volcanic activity .PERIOD <BREAK>
fish tried amphibian life .PERIOD frogs adapted to deserts .PERIOD <BREAK>
animals ,COMMA just like humans ,COMMA sometimes get strange tumors .PERIOD <BREAK>
but obviously the point is that numbers are maps .PERIOD <BREAK>
sort of through the turmoil and the opportunities and the incidents of the real world .PERIOD <BREAK>
they say ,COMMA let's question authority .PERIOD <BREAK>
if we go to the island of papua new guinea ,COMMA we can find about <NUM> to <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> distinct human languages ,COMMA different human languages ,COMMA spoken on that island alone .PERIOD <BREAK>

it hit in what we now know as yucatan ,COMMA the gulf of mexico .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's important that ,COMMA if our feelings match reality ,COMMA we make better security trade-offs .PERIOD <BREAK>
now i'm going to mark on the toughness values for nylon fiber ,COMMA bombyx -- or domesticated silkworm silk -- wool ,COMMA kevlar ,COMMA and carbon fibers .PERIOD <BREAK>
and you see ,COMMA there's a lot of back and forth in trying to make that happen ,COMMA trying to figure it out -- years and years ,COMMA oftentimes .PERIOD <BREAK>
so i'm not here today only to tell you how my team at mit has drawn out of nature a solution to one of the world's great problems .PERIOD <BREAK>
i mean ,COMMA think about that .PERIOD how grand .PERIOD how ambitious .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i think if ibm's deep blue played anyone in this room ,COMMA it would win every time .PERIOD <BREAK>
you find that -- you know ,COMMA between five and <NUM> is about the right number for keeping people going .PERIOD <BREAK>
but what struck me is the understanding that in those little pieces was the culmination of a man’s life ,COMMA search ,COMMA thought ,COMMA everything -- just in a reduced ,COMMA small version .PERIOD <BREAK>
it was way more important to me ,COMMA about me and my man box card than about sheila and what was happening to her .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA imagine we could do that and imagine we could put people into this .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i was particularly fascinated with sharks .PERIOD <BREAK>
you found an institution ,COMMA and you use the institution to coordinate the activities of the group .PERIOD <BREAK>
much of what we want computers to help us with in the first place is inherently spatial .PERIOD <BREAK>
we failed .PERIOD <BREAK>
glenn gould ,COMMA <NUM> .PERIOD <BREAK>
according to the u .PERIOD n .PERIOD new cases of hiv declined by <NUM> percent ,COMMA and according to the world bank ,COMMA <NUM> .PERIOD <NUM> million lives were saved .PERIOD <BREAK>

it spread almost entirely through word of mouth ,COMMA virally ,COMMA across teachers ,COMMA parents ,COMMA people involved in education .PERIOD <BREAK>
so with that ,COMMA i'll leave you that in my particular view of view of health :COLON geography always matters .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA now i want to show what very well might be the oldest living thing on the planet .PERIOD <BREAK>
her great aunt at the airport .PERIOD <BREAK>
ah ,COMMA mark -- serfaas .PERIOD <BREAK>
they're a form of entertainment ,COMMA they're a form of art ,COMMA a pride of ownership .PERIOD <BREAK>

if you go to other sources of data such as human development index ,COMMA that data series ,COMMA go back to the early <NUM> s ,COMMA you see exactly the same contrast .PERIOD <BREAK>
so when i thought about compassion ,COMMA my mind immediately went to one of the cartoon strips ,COMMA where he's lying there and he says ,COMMA i really understand ,COMMA and i really appreciate how one should love one's neighbor as one love's oneself .PERIOD <BREAK>
what you expect there is that old stars should be very clustered around the black hole .PERIOD <BREAK>
it can plan for the long-term benefits of the country and in the process ,COMMA evict millions of people -- that's just a small technical issue .PERIOD <BREAK>
how many symmetries does a rubik's cube have ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>

but climate policy in the wealthy world -- to the extent that such a thing exists -- is not based on precaution ,COMMA but rather on cost-benefit analysis -- finding the course of action that economists believe will have the least impact on our gdp .PERIOD <BREAK>
and he published it .PERIOD it wasn't locked up and disappeared .PERIOD <BREAK>
i want to focus on one particular thing kipp is doing that bill didn't mention .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i suspect many of you probably gave something towards that problem as well ,COMMA but somehow it doesn't happen with the same intensity .PERIOD <BREAK>
and then you have to do the initial sketch of the character ,COMMA which is like your structure of a piece ,COMMA and then you add pen and pencil and whatever details that you need -- that's polishing the drawing .PERIOD <BREAK>
so she was again in mathare ,COMMA with no income ,COMMA no skill set ,COMMA no money .PERIOD <BREAK>
and it's a much better way to see .PERIOD <BREAK>
you use the distribution you get to sell more products .PERIOD <BREAK>
and all of this seems to me to be a salient point in history .PERIOD <BREAK>
there you are ,COMMA swinging the sun around .PERIOD <BREAK>
and you could basically do this a billion times .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so the question that we might not have birds became kind of fundamental to those of us wandering around looking for the meadowlarks that seemed to have all disappeared .PERIOD <BREAK>
these crude tools were around for thousands of centuries ,COMMA until around <NUM> .PERIOD <NUM> million years ago when homo erectus started shaping single ,COMMA thin stone blades ,COMMA sometimes rounded ovals ,COMMA but often in what are to our eyes an arresting ,COMMA symmetrical pointed leaf or teardrop form .PERIOD <BREAK>

they took a fundamentally dehumanizing experience -- <NUM> kids with their fingers on their lips ,COMMA not allowed to interact with each other .PERIOD <BREAK>
so let's get to what i would like ,COMMA which is world peace .PERIOD <BREAK>
and who knows what it will be called in the end .PERIOD <BREAK>
so let's say that we work hard ,COMMA and we actually don't just tap the brakes ,COMMA but we step hard on the brakes and really reduce emissions and eventually reduce concentrations .PERIOD <BREAK>
a marsupial is a mammal with a pouch like a kangaroo .PERIOD <BREAK>

the other reason why i really like this is because it offers an alternative entry point into the complexity of science .PERIOD <BREAK>
a massive cardiac arrest .PERIOD <BREAK>
colorization and sound effects added for you viewing pleasure .PERIOD <BREAK>
but if you don't think through the problems of corruption ,COMMA who will ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and i look at something like this ,COMMA and honestly ,COMMA you know ,COMMA why would someone design underpants with a pocket ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
not only that ,COMMA why is the camera looking down ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
can i just sit in and see what you do ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>

you think that's not a question as to how we should be using the earth's resources ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and there's the conversion factor .PERIOD <BREAK>
and see what happens to your perception .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA just in ending ,COMMA let me say the only people who can fix africa are talented young africans .PERIOD <BREAK>
it doesn't mean you have to get through school .PERIOD <BREAK>
so i moved on from there .PERIOD <BREAK>
now ,COMMA suppose that space aliens arrived .PERIOD <BREAK>
simply documenting these soon-to-be-demolished structures wasn't enough for me .PERIOD <BREAK>
so you can draw a line to try to protect an area ,COMMA but chemical pollution and noise pollution will continue to move through the area .PERIOD <BREAK>
well ,COMMA there are two ways of getting there .PERIOD <BREAK>
the sound is being made right next to your ears .PERIOD is that cool ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>

a neighborhood has a thing -- it's got a landmark ,COMMA it's got a place ,COMMA it's got a restaurant .PERIOD it doesn't have a logo .PERIOD i mean ,COMMA what would that be ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>

but the performance itself was how the musicians worked their fingers ,COMMA and what instruments they were using .PERIOD <BREAK>
the other one carried evelyn aside .PERIOD <BREAK>

my pop ,COMMA he's one of the old souls ,COMMA you know -- old cuban man from camaguey .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's changing our lives in so many ways ,COMMA and it will continue to do that .PERIOD <BREAK>
and this is why they revolted .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA we appear to have a genuine difference of opinion about how to profitably use one's time .PERIOD <BREAK>
no ,COMMA i mean really .PERIOD <BREAK>
you can see it in college graduation patterns ,COMMA in job projections ,COMMA in our marriage statistics ,COMMA you can see it in the icelandic elections ,COMMA which you'll hear about later ,COMMA and you can see it on south korean surveys on son preference ,COMMA that something amazing and unprecedented is happening with women .PERIOD <BREAK>

this is important ,COMMA because it tells us that if you have moderate biting densities ,COMMA you can eradicate malaria by mosquito proofing houses .PERIOD <BREAK>
again ,COMMA we didn't know this thing was there three years ago .PERIOD <BREAK>
then you saw what that device looked like ,COMMA that the woman was using to fix her migraines ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and there are muslims ,COMMA many muslims out there ,COMMA who are saying precisely this .PERIOD <BREAK>
you learn swimming by swimming .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i have to tell you ,COMMA as a former publisher of hobbyist magazines ,COMMA i find this strangely beautiful .PERIOD <BREAK>
so if you just imagined them all being part of some big ,COMMA virtual documentation system in the sky ,COMMA say on the internet ,COMMA then life would be so much easier .PERIOD <BREAK>
they are really going to come to operate in this realm .PERIOD <BREAK>
our research often starts with a very simple question .PERIOD <BREAK>

today ,COMMA our signal detection algorithms can find very simple artifacts and noise .PERIOD <BREAK>
they were brilliant people .PERIOD i'm not dissing the neanderthals .PERIOD <BREAK>
we have to try better .PERIOD let's show them another example .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA you know ,COMMA it's a totally different way of looking at the situation .PERIOD <BREAK>
you have another horse ,COMMA where maybe the horseshoer beat him up and he'll be terrible for anything on the ground ,COMMA with the veterinarian ,COMMA but a person can ride him .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's because i didn't have a self to get in the way .PERIOD <BREAK>
and then at some period of time it pops up to the surface and ,COMMA again ,COMMA relays that data back to shore .PERIOD <BREAK>
and my father ,COMMA in a low voice ,COMMA muttering ,COMMA i'm just the youngest brother ,COMMA there's nothing i can do .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's the counterpoint to hannah arendt's banality of evil .PERIOD <BREAK>
and so i put them all together and sewed <NUM> of them in this suit .PERIOD <BREAK>
so there's a lot of projects out there trying to digitize books .PERIOD <BREAK>
i want to talk to you about one of the biggest myths in medicine ,COMMA and that is the idea that all we need are more medical breakthroughs and then all of our problems will be solved .PERIOD <BREAK>
so she had seen the scared song and wondered if i could do something .PERIOD <BREAK>
and that is really amazing .PERIOD <BREAK>
so let's do it .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is an unusual installation of airport seating .PERIOD <BREAK>
what is it called ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
they feel that they've actually gained what they never had ,COMMA that their face now reflects their personality .PERIOD <BREAK>

now ,COMMA call me mister picky .PERIOD i'm just an ad man .PERIOD <BREAK>
we've got to fly it first .PERIOD <BREAK>

i mean ,COMMA give us a sense of the numbers here -- a typical bribe and a typical fee .PERIOD i mean ,COMMA what's in your head ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
i think ,COMMA you know ,COMMA it's not just in our own country ,COMMA but really we're exporting the system around the world ,COMMA and when you look at the data of least developed countries -- especially in cities ,COMMA which are growing really rapidly -- people are eating american processed foods .PERIOD <BREAK>
in fact ,COMMA in a very precise way ,COMMA they get us to a different level because they seem to be things that are capable of complexity that's sort of as great as complexity can ever get .PERIOD <BREAK>
if you go back to the map at night ,COMMA you can get a clue to the process that lead to the dramatic change in rules in china .PERIOD <BREAK>
it was one of the finest ,COMMA largest volunteerism in any prison in the world .PERIOD <BREAK>
here's differential productivity rates .PERIOD <BREAK>
well guess what ,COMMA they look you in the eyes a little too much just to compensate for that myth .PERIOD <BREAK>
but if we think differently ,COMMA i think that ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA we can have cities that are not only zero emissions ,COMMA but have unlimited possibilities as well .PERIOD <BREAK>
this man is significant for a whole host of reasons .PERIOD <BREAK>
but it's to show you how complicated is the whole story of the production of chemical elements .PERIOD <BREAK>
they spread across africa also ,COMMA of course ,COMMA and there were older ,COMMA earlier forms of humans there .PERIOD <BREAK>

people have a more open morning ,COMMA they can actually think ,COMMA and you'll find out that maybe all these things you thought you had to do ,COMMA you don't actually have to do .PERIOD <BREAK>
a billion people depend on fish for their main source for animal protein .PERIOD <BREAK>

i have a helios .PERIOD we have the first video .PERIOD <BREAK>
artists and innovators -- many of the people you've seen on this stage .PERIOD <BREAK>
because i wanted to let them know every day of their life that they have value at this place i call my center .PERIOD <BREAK>

mexico is not at all on par with the united states ,COMMA but they are quite close .PERIOD <BREAK>

in asia ,COMMA the first country to be heavily infected was thailand -- they reached one to two percent .PERIOD <BREAK>
first you need access to land .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is why you keep sacrificing virgins ,COMMA and why your unicorn defenses are working just great .PERIOD <BREAK>
and that has -- you run into situations where you have this great acceptance of what you're doing ,COMMA and a lot of rejection of the same kind of thing .PERIOD <BREAK>
i didn't expect that person that i was going to meet to be him .PERIOD <BREAK>
the department stores are multistory ;SEMICOLON they're better built .PERIOD <BREAK>
and then ,COMMA here's a beautiful composite of the whirlpool galaxy ,COMMA taken by the hubble space telescope .PERIOD <BREAK>
think about the mind as being like a house with many rooms ,COMMA most of which we're very familiar with .PERIOD <BREAK>

that year she introduced me to dance ,COMMA and thus began my tryst with classical dance .PERIOD <BREAK>
what i mean is the world holds me so tightly -- the good and the bad -- my own follies and weakness that even this counterfeit venus with her sham heat ,COMMA and her bosom probably plumped with gel ,COMMA so moves me my breath catches .PERIOD <BREAK>
let's go back to my first example of the chinese .PERIOD <BREAK>
we have policies that reward sprawl -- we have all kinds of policies .PERIOD <BREAK>

let's see what people -- what would you say ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and they take this stuff seriously .PERIOD <BREAK>
we expand .PERIOD we take the feeling about remembering a mama ,COMMA and we defuse that to all beings in this meditation .PERIOD <BREAK>
i think there is a socializing dimension in ,COMMA kind of ,COMMA moving that border .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA when we did this for responses from the standard method and from our encoder and transducer .PERIOD <BREAK>
because this idea that health is internal and atomized and individual and pharmaceutical is largely an error .PERIOD <BREAK>
well ,COMMA it's ideas -- not worms -- that hijack our brains .PERIOD <BREAK>
this is already beginning to happen in sub-saharan africa .PERIOD <BREAK>
so there were two obstacles i had to get through .PERIOD <BREAK>
and before you say it's a norman foster design ,COMMA we designed this in ' <NUM> .PERIOD <BREAK>
we find that students get very excited when they can use this .PERIOD <BREAK>
i just thought that was amazing .PERIOD i mean ,COMMA she spoke in a way -- with amazing english ,COMMA and amazing humor ,COMMA and amazing laughter -- that made her seem like somebody i could have bumped into on the streets of new york ,COMMA or in vermont ,COMMA where i'm from .PERIOD <BREAK>
so i would suggest that we change how we classify ourselves .PERIOD <BREAK>
they were a little uncomfortable with it ,COMMA because we'd never done this before ,COMMA and they didn't know exactly how to do it .PERIOD <BREAK>
one is fully passive ,COMMA like i just described -- as in ,COMMA for instance ,COMMA the trucker example ,COMMA where we don't actually intervene in the population in any way .PERIOD <BREAK>
so with my friend marco ,COMMA we decided to go there and see who are the real palestinians and who are the real israelis .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the odds are seven to one against your finding the prince .PERIOD <BREAK>
laptops are a luxury ;SEMICOLON it's like giving them ipods .PERIOD no .PERIOD <BREAK>
or like kant ,COMMA did i use reason to figure out what was intrinsically right ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
so this is the favorite thing that i like about this whole project .PERIOD <BREAK>
and when you're squinting ,COMMA what you're doing is you're turning that from fine-grain to coarse-grain .PERIOD <BREAK>
and this is again something that people don't believe ,COMMA but i really think it's quite true .PERIOD <BREAK>
the instructions which govern this operation must be given in absolutely exhaustive detail .PERIOD <BREAK>
question one :COLON so does that actually feel the way the flying dream does ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>

i came up with a solution to this problem ,COMMA and i came up with a solution based on adaptive optics for this .PERIOD <BREAK>
we know there's more than enough energy to power this movement .PERIOD <BREAK>
start as usual ,COMMA go the other way around the loop .PERIOD <BREAK>
so here are some climbers starting out for the summit on what's called the triangular face .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA for example ,COMMA when you look at this image a good graphic invites the eye to dart around ,COMMA to selectively create a visual logic .PERIOD <BREAK>
amateurs can do it also .PERIOD <BREAK>
now there are many forms of blindness where the photoreceptors ,COMMA our light sensors that are in the back of our eye ,COMMA are gone .PERIOD <BREAK>
here ,COMMA i will do the most difficult thing .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the project soon grew from five to <NUM> weavers in about a year .PERIOD <BREAK>
and together with the methods to date these genetic differences ,COMMA this has led to the insight that modern humans -- humans that are essentially indistinguishable from you and me -- evolved in africa ,COMMA quite recently ,COMMA between <NUM> and <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> years ago .PERIOD <BREAK>
the problem is that current prosthetics don't work very well .PERIOD they're still very limited in the vision that they can provide .PERIOD <BREAK>

i grew up to study the brain because i have a brother who has been diagnosed with a brain disorder :COLON schizophrenia .PERIOD and as a sister and later ,COMMA as a scientist ,COMMA i wanted to understand ,COMMA why is it that i can take my dreams ,COMMA i can connect them to my reality ,COMMA and i can make my dreams come true ?QUESTIONMARK <BREAK>
and i went looking for chicken .PERIOD <BREAK>
so ,COMMA how do you dispose of that ?QUESTIONMARK it's a problem everywhere .PERIOD <BREAK>
and in fact ,COMMA it has created us ,COMMA has created life ,COMMA has created all the stuff of life .PERIOD <BREAK>
there's a hole at the front ,COMMA and there's a reason for that .PERIOD <BREAK>
and the last time the rich guy invited us ,COMMA he also invited a couple of philosophers .PERIOD <BREAK>
it's because of the second slogan that i want to talk about .PERIOD <BREAK>

if in the time that it took me to walk out here on this stage ,COMMA some tens of megawatts of wind power stopped pouring into the grid ,COMMA the difference would have to be made up from other generators immediately .PERIOD <BREAK>
it was proof that i had not measured up ,COMMA that i was old and not fabulous and not perfect or able to fit into the predetermined corporate image in shape .PERIOD <BREAK>
and i'd been extremely interested in this notion of randomness as it produces architectural work and as it definitely connects to the notion of the city ,COMMA an accretional notion of the city ,COMMA and that led to various ideas of organization .PERIOD <BREAK>
though ,COMMA for a lot of people ,COMMA the people who step into slavery today don't usually get kidnapped or knocked over the head .PERIOD <BREAK>

here in budrus ,COMMA we realized the wall would steal our land .PERIOD <BREAK>
